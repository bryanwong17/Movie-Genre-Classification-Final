1
00:00:39,392 --> 00:00:40,601
Come on!

2
00:01:23,753 --> 00:01:24,752
Oh, fu...

3
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,432
Okay, RPG's way over the top.

4
00:01:47,267 --> 00:01:48,976
What is the next move?

5
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,060
Next move.

6
00:01:57,065 --> 00:01:59,107
What would he do next?
What would he do next?

7
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,234
What's up, man? We doing this?

8
00:02:04,194 --> 00:02:05,278
What's he gonna do?

9
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:11,323
All right. Catch you later.

10
00:02:13,324 --> 00:02:15,658
Ka-Bar tactical knife.

11
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,499
Let's light this candle.

12
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:48,012
Come here.
Help.

13
00:02:48,888 --> 00:02:49,887
Stop.

14
00:02:50,222 --> 00:02:52,056
Let me go! Help! Help!

15
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:29,246
Give me your hand.

16
00:03:31,038 --> 00:03:33,039
What are we gonna do?
Crash.

17
00:03:33,623 --> 00:03:34,707
Hopefully in the water.

18
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,544
We can survive that?

19
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:44,046
Let's go with it for now.

20
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:53,802
Yeah! Yeah!

21
00:04:15,858 --> 00:04:18,942
Thank you, Mason.
Well...

22
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,282
Oh, signature line time.

23
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:34,535
What do you say to a beautiful woman
whose life you just saved?

24
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:45,833
Hmm.

25
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,261
Signature line time.

26
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,722
I got nothing.

27
00:05:14,143 --> 00:05:16,311
Wait, wait, wait. Hold it.

28
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,730
Thank you, Sam.

29
00:05:22,482 --> 00:05:25,192
No thanks needed.

30
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,902
Just doing what any man would do.

31
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,821
Let's just say you owe me one.
You owe...

32
00:05:34,489 --> 00:05:37,282
Missy, you owe...

33
00:05:37,657 --> 00:05:39,492
I'm sorry. Are you still talking to me?

34
00:05:39,575 --> 00:05:41,493
Oh, no, I'm sorry. I was...

35
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:45,787
thinking what I would say
to a beautiful woman. Sorry. I didn't...

36
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:48,830
Not that you're not... beautiful.
I didn't...

37
00:05:48,914 --> 00:05:50,290
This is a different one.

38
00:05:50,373 --> 00:05:51,790
This one's in my head.
Okay.

39
00:05:51,874 --> 00:05:53,750
I'm coming, too.
I'm not following you.

40
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,919
I'm not following you. I'm going this way.

41
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:05,341
Whoa, Larson.

42
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,635
This isn't some kind
of disgruntled employee thing?

43
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:12,261
No, no, I'm not disgruntled.
I'm totally gruntled.

44
00:06:12,345 --> 00:06:15,263
I'm gonna need these home electrical
fire tables on Monday.

45
00:06:15,347 --> 00:06:17,765
Uh, excuse me.
Wasn't Jerry supposed to do these?

46
00:06:17,848 --> 00:06:20,225
Jerry.
All right, here's the deal.

47
00:06:20,308 --> 00:06:22,935
Between you and me,
I never should've hired Jerry.

48
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,895
But what am I supposed to do, right?
That's my wife's brother.

49
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:28,476
Not to mention,
I accidentally texted him a d-pic...

50
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,606
which was meant for...

51
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:32,524
Jill the intern. You've seen her, yeah?

52
00:06:32,607 --> 00:06:36,443
Right, no, I know. Anyway, the point is,
he's got me by my Bert and Ernies.

53
00:06:36,777 --> 00:06:39,320
The thing is I'm about to finish my book.
And I just...

54
00:06:39,403 --> 00:06:41,571
I wanted to take the weekend
to polish it up.

55
00:06:41,655 --> 00:06:42,988
Make sure it's accurate.

56
00:06:43,072 --> 00:06:46,658
Okay, how about you just make sure
that these are as accurate as possible?

57
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:49,117
That's why you get paid the big bucks.
I'm kidding.

58
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:51,369
I know you make less than I do.
Good stuff.

59
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,994
Fire tables, Monday.

60
00:06:53,453 --> 00:06:55,663
Let's stay athletic, people.
Stay athletic.

61
00:06:55,746 --> 00:06:57,498
Mind and body. Mind and body.

62
00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:03,417
Thank you, Mason.
Well...

63
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,545
that's why I get paid the big... bucks?

64
00:07:09,838 --> 00:07:10,837
What?

65
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:12,882
Yeah, that was...

66
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:13,966
That was pretty bad.

67
00:07:36,688 --> 00:07:38,565
Ooh...

68
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:42,108
Sorry, Mr. Lowenthal.

69
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,957
Never bring a knife to a gunfight.

70
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,000
Works, works, works.

71
00:08:29,012 --> 00:08:29,929
Ah...

72
00:08:30,013 --> 00:08:32,139
Here's some Italian.
I owe you one.

73
00:08:32,222 --> 00:08:33,431
I know you're good for it.

74
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,851
If a Mossad agent had to crash land
a helicopter into the water...

75
00:08:38,934 --> 00:08:40,977
You know I was just an analyst, right?

76
00:08:41,644 --> 00:08:45,439
I'm not asking if you had to.
I'm asking if a field agent had to.

77
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:48,523
Samuel, when was the last time
you had a date?

78
00:08:48,607 --> 00:08:51,108
What do you call this?
Two putzes in a pool hall.

79
00:08:51,191 --> 00:08:55,153
Yeah, well, last night I saved
a beautiful woman in Tangier.

80
00:08:55,236 --> 00:08:56,737
Well, you'd better be careful.

81
00:08:56,862 --> 00:08:59,572
You don't want the best things
to happen to your alter ego.

82
00:08:59,655 --> 00:09:03,241
Yeah, well, right now my alter ego's
on a helicopter about to die.

83
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:06,618
Now, come on, I bought you lunch.
Fill me in here. What's up?

84
00:09:07,368 --> 00:09:09,494
A field agent wouldn't crash a copter.

85
00:09:09,578 --> 00:09:10,579
He would jump out.

86
00:09:10,704 --> 00:09:13,289
Better chance of surviving a fall
than a crash.

87
00:09:13,372 --> 00:09:15,290
Wouldn't the fall kill you
before the crash?

88
00:09:15,373 --> 00:09:17,012
It depends on the height
and how you land.

89
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,418
There's a story,
and I don't know how true it is,

90
00:09:20,501 --> 00:09:22,753
of an assassin so deadly
that he eliminated

91
00:09:22,836 --> 00:09:25,838
over 30 high-value targets
in his short career.

92
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,673
They say for his final mission,
he was hired by the Brits

93
00:09:28,757 --> 00:09:31,550
to poison a Venezuelan general in '88.

94
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:35,802
So, the operative escaped
in the helicopter, but they shot it down.

95
00:09:36,303 --> 00:09:39,471
And most believe
that that was the end of him.

96
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:43,641
Oh, but he lived.
Well, there are some who think

97
00:09:43,724 --> 00:09:46,392
that he jumped out
before the helicopter crash

98
00:09:46,517 --> 00:09:47,559
and he survived.

99
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:53,396
Yeah, they say he is out there somewhere,
living in the shadows.

100
00:09:54,897 --> 00:09:56,857
To this day, they still call him...

101
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,940
the Ghost.

102
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,862
No, but personally, I... Me?
I don't believe any of this.

103
00:10:06,154 --> 00:10:07,280
The Ghost.

104
00:10:08,656 --> 00:10:10,531
Samuel, that part is just between us.

105
00:10:10,615 --> 00:10:13,533
That is not for the book.
Of course. I wouldn't think of it.

106
00:10:13,617 --> 00:10:15,256
Did you hear what I said?
I heard you.

107
00:10:28,334 --> 00:10:29,585
Are you sure about this?

108
00:10:30,002 --> 00:10:32,671
Better chance of surviving the fall
than the crash.

109
00:10:33,171 --> 00:10:34,588
Just wait for the right moment.

110
00:10:40,676 --> 00:10:41,675
Now!

111
00:10:41,801 --> 00:10:44,177
No, I really don't think I...

112
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:01,230
Thank you, Mason.

113
00:11:03,606 --> 00:11:04,648
Call me the Ghost.

114
00:11:21,575 --> 00:11:22,826
Hey, Mr. Larson.

115
00:11:23,118 --> 00:11:24,119
Hey, William.

116
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:16,316
Hello.
Samuel J. Larson?

117
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,235
This is Kylie Applebaum, publisher.

118
00:12:18,776 --> 00:12:21,445
Sorry. I'm not interested
in any more subscriptions.

119
00:12:21,528 --> 00:12:23,447
Thank you.
I'm not selling, I'm buying.

120
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:26,948
Not literally. I'm taking a commission.
But I'm definitely not selling.

121
00:12:29,324 --> 00:12:30,576
Uh, I'm confused.

122
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:32,994
Your book.
Can you meet me at work tomorrow?

123
00:12:34,161 --> 00:12:35,996
Uh, yeah. Sure.

124
00:12:36,912 --> 00:12:38,497
So, this is your office?

125
00:12:38,581 --> 00:12:39,914
Offices are for assholes.

126
00:12:39,998 --> 00:12:41,498
I work in the cloud.
Oh...

127
00:12:41,582 --> 00:12:43,500
Okay.
I wanna publish your book.

128
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,461
You do?
And I'm not changing a word.

129
00:12:47,627 --> 00:12:50,754
Are you being serious?
Yeah. I just need for you to sign first.

130
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:52,172
Use your finger.

131
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:56,049
Okay, I should probably have my attorneys
take a look at this and then...

132
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:57,592
You don't have attorneys.

133
00:12:57,675 --> 00:13:01,136
That is sweet that you made that up.
I have your best interests at heart.

134
00:13:01,219 --> 00:13:02,595
When would this come out?

135
00:13:02,678 --> 00:13:04,721
Soon as you sign. Virtual publish.

136
00:13:04,804 --> 00:13:06,764
Like Amazon self-publish.
Amazon self-publish?

137
00:13:06,848 --> 00:13:08,724
That is amateur hour. This is big time.

138
00:13:08,807 --> 00:13:10,683
You heard of Twilight?
You published it?

139
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:13,119
If I published Twilight,
I wouldn't be talking to you.

140
00:13:13,143 --> 00:13:15,102
This is how the next Twilight's
getting published.

141
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,353
Okay. Know what?
Maybe this isn't the best fit.

142
00:13:17,437 --> 00:13:18,813
I'm not saying that. Sorry.

143
00:13:18,897 --> 00:13:22,357
Look, please sit down. I'll sign.
Initial there.

144
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:24,525
And there. One more there.

145
00:13:25,066 --> 00:13:26,109
I was wrong, one more.

146
00:13:26,193 --> 00:13:27,444
And sign there.

147
00:13:27,985 --> 00:13:29,320
Skinny Chai tea.

148
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:31,654
Oksana?
Oh, that's me.

149
00:13:32,655 --> 00:13:34,698
Skinny?
Oksana?

150
00:13:34,782 --> 00:13:38,533
Oh, yeah, I never use my real name. This
place is a den of wannabe writers. Ugh.

151
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,118
So, I'll send you the proceeds,
less my commission,

152
00:13:41,202 --> 00:13:43,953
and congrats,
you are a published author, my man.

153
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:45,579
All right.

154
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,793
You're talking to a published author.

155
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,044
Online, Mom.

156
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:57,128
I sent you the website.

157
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,630
Yes, they know about it.

158
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,130
Mom, I'm not gonna get fired.

159
00:14:01,214 --> 00:14:03,924
I'm not gonna lose my benefits, Mom.
It's... Can you...?

160
00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:06,009
Would you please look at the site?

161
00:14:06,842 --> 00:14:10,595
What do you mean, it's not there?
Come on, Ma, it's right here.

162
00:14:11,887 --> 00:14:13,138
It's under...

163
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:18,725
Nonfiction?

164
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:23,269
True Memoirs of an International Assassin?

165
00:14:23,353 --> 00:14:26,230
You said you wouldn't change a word.
I didn't. I added one.

166
00:14:26,313 --> 00:14:28,272
An important one.
It just felt so real.

167
00:14:28,356 --> 00:14:30,440
The details, the research.
It's an impressive story.

168
00:14:31,191 --> 00:14:33,442
A made-up one.
You needed social, I got it.

169
00:14:33,776 --> 00:14:34,775
Ba-dang.

170
00:14:34,943 --> 00:14:37,194
Ten thousand downloads already.
Ten thousand?

171
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:39,238
Ten zero, zero, zero, zero.

172
00:14:39,321 --> 00:14:41,480
That's a hundred thousand.
Not yet, but maybe soon.

173
00:14:42,823 --> 00:14:46,283
So... so, people think I'm a hit man?
Maybe they do. Maybe they don't.

174
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:47,951
Yeah, but I'm not.
Aren't you?

175
00:14:48,034 --> 00:14:50,118
No.
So you say.

176
00:14:51,578 --> 00:14:55,747
This is crazy. I'm not the Ghost.
Oh, I know that you're not.

177
00:14:57,082 --> 00:14:58,624
You think I'm lying?
No.

178
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,667
Stop. Stop doing that, please.

179
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,918
Doing what?
That thing with your eyebrows.

180
00:15:03,001 --> 00:15:05,211
Nobody cares about a fictional book
about an assassin.

181
00:15:05,294 --> 00:15:08,880
But a true story of an assassin,
now, that is how you move...

182
00:15:10,381 --> 00:15:12,299
tree.
What is that?

183
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,300
Five large. Your profits, less commission.

184
00:15:14,384 --> 00:15:17,386
Peppermint mocha
with a double shot for a Min-Lee.

185
00:15:17,469 --> 00:15:18,468
Oh, that's me.

186
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:19,971
Gotta jet.

187
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:27,767
Hey, Mr. Larson.

188
00:15:27,851 --> 00:15:29,518
Oh, hey, Sam.

189
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:31,894
I didn't know you were a writer.

190
00:15:33,187 --> 00:15:34,813
Uh, yeah. Where'd you hear that?

191
00:15:34,896 --> 00:15:36,981
You know how everybody
in the building talks.

192
00:15:37,523 --> 00:15:38,815
Not really, no.

193
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:41,400
Raj on five sent a Snapchat.

194
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:44,652
Oh. I'm not on the Slapchat.
It's Snap.

195
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,903
Never mind. Congrats.

196
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:47,987
Thank you.

197
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:50,739
You got to tell me though.
The whole assassin thing...

198
00:15:51,156 --> 00:15:52,198
it's BS, right?

199
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,450
Well, I could tell you, but...

200
00:15:56,909 --> 00:15:59,619
then I'd have to slit your throat
and watch you bleed out.

201
00:16:02,037 --> 00:16:03,372
Oh, I meant...

202
00:16:04,706 --> 00:16:09,042
I'm gonna take the stairs.
Yeah... that didn't come out right.

203
00:16:25,886 --> 00:16:28,095
Oh, hope you're hungry.

204
00:16:32,223 --> 00:16:33,222
Okay.

205
00:16:34,016 --> 00:16:38,101
This is where you say, "I owe you one."
And I say, "I know you're good for it."

206
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,020
I told you the Ghost was not to be shared.

207
00:16:42,021 --> 00:16:44,731
This is real life, Samuel.
People could get hurt.

208
00:16:46,356 --> 00:16:48,983
You read my book.
Of course I read the book.

209
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:50,859
I thought we were friends.

210
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:51,942
Look.

211
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,527
I'm really sorry.

212
00:16:53,611 --> 00:16:54,820
I changed the details.

213
00:16:54,904 --> 00:16:56,613
It was supposed to be fiction.

214
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:00,365
Why do you write?

215
00:17:01,324 --> 00:17:03,116
I wanna be an author. A published one.

216
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,784
But not like this.
No.

217
00:17:04,868 --> 00:17:07,077
Why do you spend all your time doing it?

218
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,120
I don't know.

219
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:15,416
To escape, I guess.
Well, then you are wasting your time.

220
00:17:16,374 --> 00:17:18,335
Stop writing other people's stories.

221
00:17:19,501 --> 00:17:21,210
And start living your own.

222
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:30,550
Look, Kylie.
I can't do this anymore.

223
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:31,842
I gotta tell the truth.

224
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:35,428
I booked an interview with Katie Couric.
On network TV?

225
00:17:35,511 --> 00:17:37,387
What, are you 80? No, streaming, live.

226
00:17:37,471 --> 00:17:40,932
I can't come clean to Katie Couric.
Who said anything about coming clean?

227
00:17:41,015 --> 00:17:43,350
Just promote the book,
make us rich as hell.

228
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:45,643
And atone for your sins
in a follow-up to Katie.

229
00:17:45,726 --> 00:17:49,895
My sins? Did I hear you correctly?
Yes, you did. The Katie Couric.

230
00:17:49,978 --> 00:17:52,897
You don't understand. I betrayed a friend,
lied about who I am.

231
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,148
So did James Frey. On Oprah.

232
00:17:55,231 --> 00:17:56,982
That guy's a fraud.
And a gazillionaire.

233
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:59,193
If you don't wanna do it,
I've got ten authors

234
00:17:59,276 --> 00:18:01,075
who would give their left nut
to get on Katie.

235
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,327
Is it warm in here?
'Cause it feels very, very warm.

236
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,746
Hey, just spoke to the executive producer.

237
00:18:19,455 --> 00:18:21,748
So, it's gonna be a softball segment,
two minutes tops.

238
00:18:21,831 --> 00:18:24,166
Katie hasn't read the book. Go get 'em.
Okay.

239
00:18:31,253 --> 00:18:32,463
Great to meet you, Sam.

240
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:34,965
I have heard so many nice things
about you.

241
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:36,047
You good?

242
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,091
They've been so nice to me.
Good.

243
00:18:38,174 --> 00:18:39,509
Anything you want.
Okay.

244
00:18:39,592 --> 00:18:40,884
Just ask.

245
00:18:40,968 --> 00:18:42,594
Well, not anything, but...

246
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,889
Thank you, Miss Couric. Appreciate it.
Oh, please. Call me Katie.

247
00:18:48,098 --> 00:18:49,097
Thank you, Katie.

248
00:18:50,182 --> 00:18:52,392
Katie.
Just... Just breathe.

249
00:18:52,475 --> 00:18:54,476
Right, right, right.
This is gonna be fun.

250
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:55,977
It is gonna be fun. It feels fun.

251
00:18:56,727 --> 00:18:57,727
Katie.

252
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,438
Right here. Just check on this page.

253
00:19:02,272 --> 00:19:03,982
It's right here.
Right here.

254
00:19:04,983 --> 00:19:07,192
Uh, Kylie?
Ten seconds.

255
00:19:07,275 --> 00:19:10,277
Where's the timetable
that doesn't match the dates?

256
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,446
Kylie.
No, no, no, the other one.

257
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:18,199
Five seconds.
Yeah, perfect.

258
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,951
Can someone find my publisher,
Kylie Applebaum, please?

259
00:19:22,368 --> 00:19:25,161
This is gonna be great. Don't worry.

260
00:19:27,955 --> 00:19:32,916
I wasn't. Should I be worried?
Love the book. Great stuff.

261
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,917
Three, two, two, two...

262
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:38,086
For years, Sam Larson was known simply
as the Ghost.

263
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:43,631
But now he's telling all in his new book,
True Memoirs of an International Assassin.

264
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,215
Sam, thanks for being here.

265
00:19:45,298 --> 00:19:46,425
Hello. Nice to... See me.

266
00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:48,676
Do you mind if I read a passage
from your book?

267
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:51,011
Oh, why do you need? You don't...
You're gonna...

268
00:19:51,094 --> 00:19:53,012
"Killing became easy for me.

269
00:19:53,137 --> 00:19:55,930
I told myself that I was making the world
a better place.

270
00:19:56,014 --> 00:19:58,181
But in my heart of hearts,
I knew the truth.

271
00:19:58,265 --> 00:19:59,850
I was addicted to death."

272
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,100
Is Kylie...?

273
00:20:02,393 --> 00:20:04,978
So, Sam, let me ask you.

274
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:07,229
Are you still addicted to death?

275
00:20:08,604 --> 00:20:10,231
Can I...? You know, can I just...?

276
00:20:10,313 --> 00:20:12,816
Before we start,
I've just got to go to the bathroom.

277
00:20:12,898 --> 00:20:15,276
Is there a...? Do they have a bathroom?
Do they...?

278
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,152
In the outside, is there a bathroom?
We're actually live.

279
00:20:18,235 --> 00:20:20,487
But this is also live
and I gotta make it happen.

280
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,570
I get... Is there...?

281
00:20:22,613 --> 00:20:24,197
I've got to just... Excuse me.

282
00:20:25,781 --> 00:20:26,782
No, no.

283
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:31,827
This is bad. This is very bad.
Alison, is that him running?

284
00:20:33,328 --> 00:20:34,746
Taxi! Taxi!

285
00:20:34,912 --> 00:20:37,831
And now he's apparently getting
into a cab.

286
00:20:37,914 --> 00:20:39,874
You know how many books
this is gonna sell?

287
00:20:39,957 --> 00:20:40,957
Go, go, go.

288
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:46,003
Just keep on driving, please, fast.

289
00:20:46,086 --> 00:20:47,295
Can you go?

290
00:20:47,503 --> 00:20:48,920
Can you pass him?

291
00:20:58,218 --> 00:20:59,217
Okay.

292
00:21:10,684 --> 00:21:12,143
Oh, God.

293
00:21:14,895 --> 00:21:15,895
Hello?

294
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,709
Is that blood?

295
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,838
Hey... there seems to be
some kind of mistake here.

296
00:22:04,467 --> 00:22:06,009
I don't think there has...

297
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:08,969
Mason Carver.

298
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:12,806
Oh, no. Oh, no.
There definitely has. Um...

299
00:22:15,307 --> 00:22:17,100
Mason Carver, he's not real.
No.

300
00:22:17,183 --> 00:22:19,976
But the Ghost, he is very real.

301
00:22:22,895 --> 00:22:24,562
Although I did imagine you to be a bit...

302
00:22:25,939 --> 00:22:27,981
you know... longer.

303
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:31,067
You're pro-Dem guerillas.
Yes.

304
00:22:33,068 --> 00:22:33,984
I'm in Venezuela.

305
00:22:34,068 --> 00:22:34,985
Very good.

306
00:22:35,069 --> 00:22:36,445
But I'm not the Ghost.

307
00:22:37,028 --> 00:22:39,613
Of course you're not, eh?

308
00:22:42,365 --> 00:22:43,407
I am El Toro.

309
00:22:44,491 --> 00:22:46,117
Although you already knew that.

310
00:22:46,826 --> 00:22:49,452
Just like you knew
that there was a Venezuelan general

311
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:51,954
that was assassinated by a sniper
in the late '80s.

312
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:53,664
Oh, no, no, no.

313
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,665
See, I changed that for the book.

314
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,416
He was actually poisoned.

315
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,627
He was. Which is something
only the Ghost would know.

316
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,423
Oh, God.

317
00:23:14,301 --> 00:23:15,300
Thank you.

318
00:23:15,802 --> 00:23:18,053
My hands were getting all numb
and prickly.

319
00:23:18,137 --> 00:23:21,764
You know, the needles.
But please, you've got to understand.

320
00:23:22,806 --> 00:23:26,433
I'm a writer, you know,
who does lots of research.

321
00:23:27,934 --> 00:23:29,435
But I'm not... I'm not the Ghost.

322
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:31,895
Exactly... what the Ghost would say.

323
00:23:32,437 --> 00:23:35,106
I promise you, you've got the wrong guy.

324
00:23:35,189 --> 00:23:37,691
You know how I know
that you are the Ghost, my friend?

325
00:23:37,774 --> 00:23:38,858
Because if you're not...

326
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,650
I will kill you.

327
00:23:42,193 --> 00:23:45,279
I will cut you slowly and painfully
with my knife.

328
00:23:46,821 --> 00:23:47,822
So painfully...

329
00:23:48,989 --> 00:23:52,032
that your innards will fall out
and spill out on the floor.

330
00:23:54,075 --> 00:23:56,702
Then I will grab them and place them
on your chest.

331
00:23:56,785 --> 00:23:59,370
And then I will place your hands
over them like that.

332
00:24:00,413 --> 00:24:02,956
Something I like to call
the Venezuelan embrace.

333
00:24:09,626 --> 00:24:10,626
I am him.

334
00:24:13,963 --> 00:24:16,131
I am the Ghost.
I knew it.

335
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:19,257
Él es el Fantasma.
Ah!

336
00:24:19,924 --> 00:24:21,426
So, what can I do for you?

337
00:24:21,675 --> 00:24:23,927
Mm. You, my friend...

338
00:24:25,136 --> 00:24:28,305
You are going to kill
the president of Venezuela.

339
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:38,019
In two days,
our so-called president

340
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:42,855
will throw himself an inauguration ball
to celebrate his fifth unelected term.

341
00:24:44,106 --> 00:24:46,274
And there, you will take his life.

342
00:24:47,441 --> 00:24:50,026
And in doing so,
you will send a message to the people

343
00:24:50,109 --> 00:24:52,736
that greed and corruption
will not be tolerated.

344
00:24:53,236 --> 00:24:54,905
And that the revolution has begun.

345
00:24:55,654 --> 00:24:56,655
I understand completely.

346
00:24:56,739 --> 00:24:59,824
It just seems you've got quite
a few resources here.

347
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,534
Wow, is that a 50 cal...
Yeah, that's a 50 cal.

348
00:25:02,618 --> 00:25:04,702
Um, why not do it yourself?

349
00:25:04,785 --> 00:25:07,621
Because not even I could reach the man
in his palace.

350
00:25:07,704 --> 00:25:10,206
For that, I need someone
with your unique talents.

351
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,165
Right. First step would be
reconnaissance.

352
00:25:13,248 --> 00:25:16,083
Uh, I would need a vehicle
and a map clearly indicating

353
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:19,127
where the nearest airport is located.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

354
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:21,085
Why would you need that?

355
00:25:22,171 --> 00:25:24,047
Because once it's done...

356
00:25:24,505 --> 00:25:27,507
um, I'll have less than 90 minutes
to leave the country.

357
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,091
Out of the country?

358
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:31,801
When it's done.
Ninety minutes.

359
00:25:33,969 --> 00:25:36,346
Okay, you're right. You will need a car.

360
00:25:37,347 --> 00:25:39,473
And a driver, my second in command.

361
00:25:39,556 --> 00:25:41,224
Psst. Oye, drive him.

362
00:25:44,392 --> 00:25:45,392
Nice to meet you.

363
00:25:47,102 --> 00:25:48,145
You are not the Ghost.

364
00:25:48,228 --> 00:25:51,230
He is the Ghost, Juan. He's the Ghost.
He's not the Ghost.

365
00:25:52,356 --> 00:25:53,482
And when I prove it...

366
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,566
I'm gonna kill him myself.

367
00:26:00,611 --> 00:26:02,153
I must apologize for Juan.

368
00:26:02,236 --> 00:26:03,863
He's a bit of a wet blanket.

369
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:05,363
Good luck.

370
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:18,121
That idiot is dead.

371
00:26:18,872 --> 00:26:20,915
So incredibly dead.

372
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:23,541
Voice analysis is back.

373
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,251
Name's Samuel Larson.

374
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:29,420
He published a book claiming to be,
get this...

375
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,588
an international assassin.

376
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,757
We should probably pull him out,
put him on a plane home.

377
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,257
Why the hell would we do that?

378
00:26:36,967 --> 00:26:38,175
Because we're the CIA.

379
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,347
You almost got me. You almost got me.
You know I like messing with you, man.

380
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,515
I didn't know where you were going
with that.

381
00:26:48,598 --> 00:26:51,392
Bet you a Benji he's dead in less than 48.

382
00:26:51,475 --> 00:26:53,810
Double he doesn't make it to breakfast.

383
00:26:53,893 --> 00:26:54,894
Yeah.

384
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:56,181
Come on.
From here you do your reconnaissance.

385
00:28:05,312 --> 00:28:07,438
So, I guess I should get started. Uh...

386
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:11,774
So, I will see you
in probably a few hours, I guess.

387
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:13,150
Where you go, I follow.

388
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,402
Look. We seem to have gotten off
on the wrong foot.

389
00:28:16,485 --> 00:28:19,821
No, I'm on the right foot.
The foot of you are not the Ghost.

390
00:28:20,487 --> 00:28:21,822
What makes you so sure?

391
00:28:22,072 --> 00:28:24,532
The Ghost would never have been kidnapped
so easily.

392
00:28:25,074 --> 00:28:28,909
That's a fair point. But you know,
maybe I wanted to be kidnapped.

393
00:28:29,493 --> 00:28:32,662
Or maybe you're a fraud. And a liar.

394
00:28:33,203 --> 00:28:34,455
And maybe I kill you right now.

395
00:28:35,497 --> 00:28:36,998
So, what is the Ghost gonna do?

396
00:28:38,749 --> 00:28:39,875
That's a good question.

397
00:28:58,802 --> 00:28:59,802
So?

398
00:29:00,763 --> 00:29:02,263
What is the Ghost gonna do?

399
00:29:04,348 --> 00:29:05,849
He's gonna pee. I got to pee.

400
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:09,684
Around the corner, to the right.
Gotcha.

401
00:29:53,586 --> 00:29:54,587
¿Güero?

402
00:30:19,894 --> 00:30:20,894
Open up.

403
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,520
Open up.

404
00:30:33,361 --> 00:30:34,653
Güero, open the door.

405
00:30:54,915 --> 00:30:56,125
¡Policía!

406
00:31:00,043 --> 00:31:01,378
¡Policía!

407
00:31:15,594 --> 00:31:16,595
Damn.

408
00:31:19,389 --> 00:31:21,807
They're gonna kill the president.
Who is?

409
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,433
Pro-Dem guerrillas. El Toro.

410
00:31:23,516 --> 00:31:27,060
They tried to hire me.
They tried to hire you?

411
00:31:27,144 --> 00:31:28,477
Yeah, but not the real me.

412
00:31:28,561 --> 00:31:31,729
The fake me from my book,
True Memoirs of an International Assassin.

413
00:31:31,813 --> 00:31:37,233
If that is the fake you,
then why does it say "true" in the title?

414
00:31:37,316 --> 00:31:40,068
It's just to sell more books.
So, can you show me a copy?

415
00:31:40,152 --> 00:31:42,236
You got a computer?

416
00:31:42,695 --> 00:31:46,071
The computer's not working today.
You don't have one working computer?

417
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:49,365
You don't have one copy of your book?
It's a virtual book.

418
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:52,534
Ah, then it's not a real book.
No, it's real. It's real, okay?

419
00:31:52,617 --> 00:31:53,868
It's just online.

420
00:31:53,993 --> 00:31:55,752
It could be the next...
Do you know Twilight?

421
00:31:55,785 --> 00:31:58,996
Oh, I know Twilight.
It could be the next Twilight...

422
00:31:59,121 --> 00:32:01,247
Can you just take me to the embassy?

423
00:32:09,502 --> 00:32:11,503
This doesn't look like the embassy.

424
00:32:11,837 --> 00:32:14,380
It's not the real embassy, no.

425
00:32:21,509 --> 00:32:22,594
You sit here.

426
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:26,971
Make yourself comfortable.
I'm calling him.

427
00:32:30,891 --> 00:32:31,932
Sí.

428
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,478
We...? We gonna be here long?

429
00:32:54,988 --> 00:32:56,072
Okay.

430
00:32:56,156 --> 00:32:57,948
You need to get me some money.

431
00:32:58,407 --> 00:33:01,409
Some next-Twilight-sized money.

432
00:33:05,578 --> 00:33:07,371
Yello.
Kylie. Hi, it's Sam.

433
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:09,706
Ghost with the most. What's the word?

434
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:11,582
I'm in Venezuela.
Sure you are.

435
00:33:11,665 --> 00:33:13,833
I'm doing that eyebrow thing
right now, BTdubs.

436
00:33:13,917 --> 00:33:15,209
I'm telling the truth.

437
00:33:15,751 --> 00:33:18,377
Uh... I've been abducted. Twice.

438
00:33:22,506 --> 00:33:25,548
Oh, you are so method. I love it.

439
00:33:25,632 --> 00:33:28,133
Can't wait to find out
what the Ghost does.

440
00:33:28,217 --> 00:33:31,219
Oh, got to go. That's me. I'm Curtis.

441
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,054
Nothing, I...

442
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,681
I got nothing.
No.

443
00:33:37,848 --> 00:33:40,808
I need to hear about a large sum of money.

444
00:33:40,933 --> 00:33:43,310
Or your face is going to be nothing

445
00:33:43,392 --> 00:33:46,228
in three, two, one...
No. Come on, please. No, no, no.

446
00:33:50,773 --> 00:33:53,690
Let's light this candle.
Whoa, what are you doing?

447
00:33:54,274 --> 00:33:56,359
What was that?
I didn't... I don't know.

448
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:59,861
Ow! That hurt. Oh, that hurt.
This is going to hurt more.

449
00:33:59,945 --> 00:34:01,071
No. No, please, no.

450
00:34:15,996 --> 00:34:17,705
No!

451
00:34:32,798 --> 00:34:34,258
Get a move on, cupcake.

452
00:34:49,892 --> 00:34:51,893
I'm sorry. Who are you?

453
00:34:51,977 --> 00:34:53,561
Rosa Bolivar. DEA.

454
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,604
I've been trailing those cops
for two weeks.

455
00:34:56,688 --> 00:34:59,231
They're on the payroll
for a heroin-smuggling Russian

456
00:34:59,314 --> 00:35:00,481
named Anton Masovich.

457
00:35:01,274 --> 00:35:02,149
Who's that?

458
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:04,859
A heroin-smuggling Russian...
Did you not hear what I said?

459
00:35:04,943 --> 00:35:06,110
I'm sorry. Okay, look.

460
00:35:06,235 --> 00:35:07,987
Thank you for saving me.

461
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:09,862
I don't do this job for thanks.

462
00:35:10,946 --> 00:35:12,364
That's a good signature line.

463
00:35:12,447 --> 00:35:14,782
Why does El Toro think
you can kill the president?

464
00:35:14,865 --> 00:35:16,533
It's just a misunderstanding.

465
00:35:16,616 --> 00:35:18,909
I'm a writer. I create characters.

466
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:22,120
This right here is not me.
What's your name?

467
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:24,413
My name is Sam.

468
00:35:24,496 --> 00:35:26,664
I'll tell you what,
Sam and cheese.

469
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:30,250
I'm gonna get you out of this.
Thank God. Thank you very much.

470
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:31,959
You're gonna do me a favor first.

471
00:35:32,042 --> 00:35:32,918
Anything you need.

472
00:35:33,002 --> 00:35:35,128
Meet with Masovich.
That's not gonna happen.

473
00:35:35,211 --> 00:35:38,630
Your friends there told Masovich
that you would be at his place in 15.

474
00:35:38,714 --> 00:35:41,090
If you don't show,
he's gonna know something's up.

475
00:35:41,215 --> 00:35:42,507
What does he want with me?

476
00:35:42,591 --> 00:35:44,925
That's what you need to find out,
honey baked.

477
00:35:47,802 --> 00:35:48,886
Honey baked?

478
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,433
It's that one with the huge gate.

479
00:35:57,516 --> 00:35:59,726
I'm not going in there.
The one with the guards?

480
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:02,644
Is that a Doberman?
They've got Dobermans walking around, no.

481
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:05,313
I'm not gonna be buried in Venezuela.
I'm not going in.

482
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,564
If I go in,
I will be murdered in the face.

483
00:36:08,189 --> 00:36:09,189
Look at me.

484
00:36:10,774 --> 00:36:12,317
Breathe.
I'm breathing.

485
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,735
Not like you're drowning.

486
00:36:13,818 --> 00:36:14,817
Slow it down.

487
00:36:15,944 --> 00:36:16,944
Breathe.

488
00:36:18,362 --> 00:36:19,780
If Masovich wanted you dead,

489
00:36:19,863 --> 00:36:22,115
he would have ordered those cops
to execute you.

490
00:36:22,198 --> 00:36:24,199
He didn't. They were going off-script

491
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:26,117
when they started shaking you down
for money.

492
00:36:26,993 --> 00:36:29,953
Find out Masovich's interest
in El Toro and the president,

493
00:36:30,037 --> 00:36:31,412
and I'll get you home safely.

494
00:36:31,954 --> 00:36:34,914
Masovich needs to believe
you are an assassin.

495
00:36:42,586 --> 00:36:43,669
Oh, I'm so gonna die.

496
00:36:44,003 --> 00:36:45,087
I'm so gonna die.

497
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,184
I'm Anton Masovich.

498
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:09,644
Come outside.

499
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,062
It's a beautiful day.

500
00:37:13,271 --> 00:37:14,688
How about a nice cold Zima?

501
00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:22,108
You like?

502
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:23,861
They are fun girls, huh?

503
00:37:24,778 --> 00:37:27,321
Yeah, I can tell by all the splashing.

504
00:37:28,572 --> 00:37:31,282
When this is over,
you can have whichever one you like.

505
00:37:32,282 --> 00:37:34,076
What do you mean, when this is over?

506
00:37:34,617 --> 00:37:35,617
Take a seat.

507
00:37:36,535 --> 00:37:38,703
How are you connected to El Toro?

508
00:37:38,953 --> 00:37:40,037
The truth.

509
00:37:41,914 --> 00:37:43,873
El Toro wants me to kill the president.

510
00:37:45,207 --> 00:37:47,124
He thinks I'm an international assassin.

511
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:50,502
And? Are you?
No. Not even close.

512
00:37:51,795 --> 00:37:53,337
I'm sorry, Mr. Masovich.

513
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,672
The Zima shipment was delayed.

514
00:37:55,755 --> 00:37:57,839
I've brought you Smirnoff Ice.

515
00:37:57,923 --> 00:37:59,675
Don't worry about it, Paolo.

516
00:37:59,758 --> 00:38:03,009
Why they only sell Zima in Japan
is beyond me.

517
00:38:03,093 --> 00:38:04,093
Am I right?

518
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:06,387
You are. I mean, I just... I totally agree.

519
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:09,430
I mean, if you wanna be global,
you've gotta be accessible.

520
00:38:09,514 --> 00:38:12,599
You gotta be, you know, you gotta
be able to reach out, Paolo.

521
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,434
I'm blessed to be kept swimming,
most of the time.

522
00:38:18,852 --> 00:38:21,854
El Toro is a terrorist
who's brainwashed his followers.

523
00:38:21,938 --> 00:38:25,357
He's a major concern
to my business interests in this country.

524
00:38:25,815 --> 00:38:29,943
I've tried to flip his men in the past,
but they'd rather die on the sword.

525
00:38:30,527 --> 00:38:31,526
What about you?

526
00:38:32,695 --> 00:38:35,196
What about me?
Do you wanna die on the sword?

527
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:36,113
No, no, no.

528
00:38:36,196 --> 00:38:39,198
I don't want to die on the sword,
or, like, on anything else.

529
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:40,491
I don't...
Wonderful.

530
00:38:41,032 --> 00:38:42,200
Then you kill him for me.

531
00:38:43,243 --> 00:38:44,242
I'm sorry, what?

532
00:38:44,743 --> 00:38:46,036
Kill El Toro.

533
00:38:46,703 --> 00:38:47,745
He trusts you,

534
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:50,872
so, you can get close to him.
Yeah, but I'm not an assassin.

535
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:53,832
So you keep saying.
But you clearly have the skills.

536
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:58,460
You disabled Detective Garcia,
and you came here.

537
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,795
Which suggests to me
that you are sure of yourself.

538
00:39:01,878 --> 00:39:05,089
I promise, I'm not sure of myself.
When they ask paper or plastic,

539
00:39:05,172 --> 00:39:07,674
I'm even like, "Whatever's easiest
for you," you know?

540
00:39:08,633 --> 00:39:11,801
¿No habla inglés?
Yeah, your modesty doesn't fool me.

541
00:39:11,884 --> 00:39:13,261
I'll give you a choice.

542
00:39:13,344 --> 00:39:16,680
You can use your unique position for evil

543
00:39:17,012 --> 00:39:22,141
by killing the president, starting a war,
and bringing this country to its knees...

544
00:39:22,683 --> 00:39:25,101
or you use it for good.

545
00:39:29,187 --> 00:39:30,186
For me.

546
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,732
By killing El Toro.
I just wanna go home.

547
00:39:33,815 --> 00:39:36,692
How is everything, Mr. Masovich?
It's great.

548
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,360
Paolo here has known me
since I was five years old.

549
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:41,361
Isn't that right?

550
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:45,822
It has been my pleasure to serve you
and to watch you grow into a strong man.

551
00:39:46,489 --> 00:39:50,825
My father hired him when we came
to this country almost 40 years ago.

552
00:39:52,285 --> 00:39:54,494
Wow, that is so nice.

553
00:40:02,916 --> 00:40:05,334
But he should have restocked the Zima.

554
00:40:06,084 --> 00:40:07,961
I can find you in a second.

555
00:40:09,211 --> 00:40:10,920
Don't let me down like Paolo.

556
00:40:35,478 --> 00:40:37,187
Oh, you're not gonna believe this.

557
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:40,314
Is that Masovich's place?
You know what this means?

558
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:43,024
Double down on our bet?
Well, yeah.

559
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:46,359
But also, if he's met with two
of the three kings of Caracas,

560
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:48,235
we should probably tell the third.

561
00:40:49,069 --> 00:40:51,279
And I should probably download his book.

562
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,494
You forget about me, bacon bits?

563
00:41:03,286 --> 00:41:05,245
So, Masovich must have
had a chat with you

564
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,997
and said you could leave the country.
No strings attached.

565
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,998
Yeah, maybe one string.
Yeah, I know.

566
00:41:10,081 --> 00:41:13,000
I heard the whole thing.
Yeah? Well, I'm getting out of here.

567
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:15,543
I just saw a man get murdered,
actually, in the face.

568
00:41:15,627 --> 00:41:17,711
So, I'm going to the embassy.
Go ahead.

569
00:41:17,795 --> 00:41:20,213
I promise you, you go in there,
you will die.

570
00:41:23,965 --> 00:41:25,508
The guy's got eyes everywhere.

571
00:41:26,175 --> 00:41:27,175
Even here.

572
00:41:35,223 --> 00:41:37,098
He wants you to kill El Toro.

573
00:41:37,849 --> 00:41:38,933
This is good.

574
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:41,726
But this is insane.

575
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:44,228
I'm not an assassin.
Now I've got two contracts. Two.

576
00:41:44,311 --> 00:41:45,145
How is this good?

577
00:41:45,229 --> 00:41:48,688
Because it confirms Anton Masovich
is protecting the president.

578
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:52,358
All I have to do is prove it.
And then I can have them both extradited.

579
00:41:53,399 --> 00:41:55,235
The president's all about the high life,

580
00:41:55,318 --> 00:41:58,153
which Masovich is obviously financing
with his drug business.

581
00:41:58,237 --> 00:42:00,238
Look, if El Toro wants you to take out...

582
00:42:00,655 --> 00:42:02,906
Take out the president,
why don't you help him do it?

583
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:06,282
Because, McRib, my job
is to uphold the law, not break it.

584
00:42:06,366 --> 00:42:08,535
Do me a favor.
Can you stop with the names?

585
00:42:08,618 --> 00:42:10,661
Sorry, I didn't know you were
that sensitive.

586
00:42:10,744 --> 00:42:11,953
Yes. I am sensitive.

587
00:42:12,036 --> 00:42:14,746
To dying. I'm different that way.
My mother would be like,

588
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:17,873
"Why are you scared of death?"
I don't know. I guess I'm allergic.

589
00:42:17,957 --> 00:42:20,458
It turns out I'm allergic.
I'm allergic to death.

590
00:42:20,542 --> 00:42:23,043
I understand. This is a scary place.

591
00:42:23,669 --> 00:42:26,962
But if you wanna make it home alive,
you've gotta get out of your head,

592
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,171
and get in the game.

593
00:42:40,136 --> 00:42:43,639
This guy has the attention of El Toro
and Masovich?

594
00:42:43,722 --> 00:42:45,348
Well, it seems that way, Mike.

595
00:42:45,431 --> 00:42:47,266
Cut that Mike shit right now, slick.

596
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:50,142
It's either my real name or el Presidente.

597
00:42:50,226 --> 00:42:51,936
Relax, Miguel.

598
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:54,104
We all know you grew up in San Diego.

599
00:42:54,187 --> 00:42:57,689
Maybe Masovich and El Toro
believe this guy actually is legit.

600
00:42:57,772 --> 00:42:59,357
Well, is he?
No.

601
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,607
Look at him.
Mm-hm.

602
00:43:00,691 --> 00:43:02,484
Well, we don't know that for certain.

603
00:43:02,567 --> 00:43:05,235
I will interrogate this Sam Larson.

604
00:43:06,236 --> 00:43:08,737
It is, after all, a matter
of national security.

605
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,031
Sí, sí. Have General Ruiz talk to him.

606
00:43:12,115 --> 00:43:14,449
Fine. But don't make any other moves.

607
00:43:14,533 --> 00:43:18,118
We've all worked way too hard to maintain
the balance of power in this dump.

608
00:43:18,201 --> 00:43:19,201
Dump?

609
00:43:19,286 --> 00:43:20,744
Yeah. Dump.

610
00:43:20,828 --> 00:43:23,204
Come on, Mike. You hate this place
as much as we do.

611
00:43:23,288 --> 00:43:26,123
I know, I know. But do you have
to keep reminding me?

612
00:43:26,915 --> 00:43:27,958
Yes.

613
00:43:30,334 --> 00:43:32,586
This is the address to my safe house.

614
00:43:32,919 --> 00:43:34,628
I'll pick you up tomorrow.
Tomorrow?

615
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:38,047
Don't even think about going out.
Masovich owns half the cops,

616
00:43:38,131 --> 00:43:39,506
and controls the airport.

617
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:41,048
You can't risk being seen.

618
00:43:41,132 --> 00:43:42,925
Yeah, but you've got backup, right?

619
00:43:44,092 --> 00:43:45,802
I'm a one-woman operation.

620
00:43:46,427 --> 00:43:48,779
I gotta believe the U.S. government
knew what was happening...

621
00:43:48,803 --> 00:43:51,722
CIA wants to maintain the status quo.
Nothing more.

622
00:43:52,222 --> 00:43:55,057
I learned my first year down here
that if I wanna do any good,

623
00:43:55,141 --> 00:43:56,141
I have to do it myself.

624
00:43:57,767 --> 00:43:58,894
Sounds kind of lonely.

625
00:44:00,477 --> 00:44:01,978
La cuenta, por favor.

626
00:44:02,103 --> 00:44:03,187
Don't worry.

627
00:44:04,563 --> 00:44:05,563
It's on me.

628
00:44:06,148 --> 00:44:07,607
Your gun. Now.

629
00:44:12,568 --> 00:44:14,278
You're coming with me, Ghost.

630
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:16,696
Juan, I'm sorry about locking you out.
Move.

631
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:18,905
What if I don't?

632
00:44:27,201 --> 00:44:28,745
I said move.
Already moving.

633
00:44:34,749 --> 00:44:35,832
Let's go.

634
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:41,044
I don't like to fight women.

635
00:44:46,213 --> 00:44:47,214
I can see why.

636
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,760
Get in the game!

637
00:45:01,514 --> 00:45:03,265
You and I aren't done yet.

638
00:45:04,308 --> 00:45:05,308
Looks like we are.

639
00:45:12,313 --> 00:45:14,272
You follow us and you die.

640
00:45:22,361 --> 00:45:25,947
You're not gonna kill her.
I'm a freedom fighter, not a murderer.

641
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:27,864
But you said you'd murder me.

642
00:45:27,948 --> 00:45:29,740
For you, I will make an exception.

643
00:45:30,491 --> 00:45:33,826
Let Mike and General Ruiz know
they just left Café Luna.

644
00:45:35,494 --> 00:45:38,412
Cleveland, look alive. Come on, man.
Sorry.

645
00:45:38,496 --> 00:45:40,705
You know the Ghost was hired
by the Brits in '88

646
00:45:40,789 --> 00:45:42,706
to take out the leader of that last coup?

647
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:43,874
General Sanchez?

648
00:45:45,166 --> 00:45:46,166
Actually, I didn't.

649
00:45:46,584 --> 00:45:49,669
But I guess that makes sense.
MI5 definitely wanted him gone.

650
00:45:50,628 --> 00:45:53,213
Well, either this guy had some
crazy contacts...

651
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:56,298
or he might actually be the real deal.

652
00:45:57,548 --> 00:45:58,841
Just call General Ruiz.

653
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,345
Where are we going?

654
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:07,971
Back to El Toro's.

655
00:46:09,306 --> 00:46:12,391
But I didn't have a chance
to kill the president.

656
00:46:13,642 --> 00:46:14,893
We both know you won't.

657
00:46:15,434 --> 00:46:17,061
That's not true.
It is.

658
00:46:17,602 --> 00:46:20,646
You are a man of words, not of action.

659
00:46:21,605 --> 00:46:22,689
I punched you.

660
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:26,233
You punch like a small child.
It hurt you.

661
00:46:26,566 --> 00:46:29,026
It tickled.
No, no, no. I'm sorry, I saw your eyes,

662
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:31,277
they got all glassy,
like you were about to cry.

663
00:46:31,361 --> 00:46:34,780
"Like a small child."
I'll spank you like a small child.

664
00:46:34,863 --> 00:46:38,949
Oh, yeah? Why don't
you try, and see what the Ghost does?

665
00:46:39,991 --> 00:46:41,450
You are not the Ghost.
Really?

666
00:46:42,535 --> 00:46:43,534
Where's your gun?

667
00:46:47,454 --> 00:46:49,163
Like I said, all words.

668
00:46:52,499 --> 00:46:54,417
Oh... Maybe I am the Ghost...

669
00:46:55,418 --> 00:46:57,043
God! Really?

670
00:46:57,794 --> 00:46:58,794
Oh, man.

671
00:46:59,962 --> 00:47:01,921
Now it is your eyes that are glassy.

672
00:47:05,132 --> 00:47:06,132
What is it?

673
00:47:07,466 --> 00:47:09,175
The army.
The army's bad?

674
00:47:09,884 --> 00:47:12,386
When you're a rebel trying to overthrow
the government,

675
00:47:12,469 --> 00:47:13,721
it doesn't get much worse.

676
00:47:15,221 --> 00:47:16,805
Come on.
All right.

677
00:47:24,184 --> 00:47:28,020
We wait here till night falls.
But that's your truck across the street.

678
00:47:28,104 --> 00:47:29,688
If they see us, they'll shoot us.

679
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:32,857
They find us here, they'll shoot us here.
We gotta go to the truck.

680
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,441
Not a good idea.
Come on, Juan.

681
00:47:34,524 --> 00:47:36,776
Get out of your head, get in the game.
Hey!

682
00:48:08,086 --> 00:48:09,254
¿El baño?

683
00:48:18,134 --> 00:48:19,635
¿El baño, por favor?

684
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:36,645
El baño, can I...?

685
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,065
Don't talk.

686
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,276
What is your involvement...

687
00:48:46,526 --> 00:48:47,526
with El Toro...

688
00:48:48,403 --> 00:48:49,904
and Anton Masovich?

689
00:48:51,363 --> 00:48:53,531
Masovich wants me
to kill El Toro. El Toro,

690
00:48:53,615 --> 00:48:55,199
he wants me to kill the president.

691
00:48:55,991 --> 00:48:57,200
Confusing, right? It's...

692
00:48:57,283 --> 00:48:59,785
I wasn't gonna do it, by the way.
I would never...

693
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:02,411
I wasn't gonna kill the president.

694
00:49:02,995 --> 00:49:05,914
It took El Toro long enough.
Excuse me?

695
00:49:07,498 --> 00:49:10,666
El Toro has been turning the people
against the president for years.

696
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:11,750
Let me guess.

697
00:49:12,459 --> 00:49:14,960
He wanted you to do it
at the inauguration ball.

698
00:49:16,378 --> 00:49:17,378
Yes.

699
00:49:17,879 --> 00:49:20,255
So cliché.
I thought so, too.

700
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:22,590
It felt a little on the nose, you know?
Listen.

701
00:49:23,174 --> 00:49:26,218
Mason, Ghost, whatever your name is.

702
00:49:26,301 --> 00:49:28,552
Sam. My name is Sam.
Sam.

703
00:49:29,804 --> 00:49:32,013
I had a tiny cat named Sam.

704
00:49:33,806 --> 00:49:35,515
That would be a kitten.

705
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:37,808
In the States, we call it a kitten.
Kitten.

706
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:38,891
Thank you.

707
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,351
Listen, Sam.

708
00:49:42,394 --> 00:49:44,604
Forget all those offers.

709
00:49:45,687 --> 00:49:49,398
The president needs you
to help him take out Masovich.

710
00:49:50,482 --> 00:49:54,026
Masovich? I would have thought...
El Toro... I'm just lost.

711
00:49:54,109 --> 00:49:55,109
I'm just...

712
00:49:57,737 --> 00:50:01,239
If El Toro needs you, then he clearly
can't get to the president on his own.

713
00:50:01,322 --> 00:50:05,950
Masovich, on the other hand, has had
his claws in the president for years.

714
00:50:06,033 --> 00:50:08,160
The longer the president
appeases Masovich,

715
00:50:08,244 --> 00:50:11,370
the greater the chance
that he will be exposed and disgraced.

716
00:50:11,453 --> 00:50:12,871
Yeah.

717
00:50:13,163 --> 00:50:14,497
I just wanna go home.

718
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:17,374
And I will get you home, if you do this.

719
00:50:17,457 --> 00:50:18,916
Will you kill Masovich?

720
00:50:19,542 --> 00:50:20,960
I really don't want to, so...

721
00:50:21,543 --> 00:50:22,728
Then you will be tried and executed

722
00:50:22,752 --> 00:50:25,462
for plotting to assassinate
the president of Venezuela.

723
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,172
I'll do it, though, I mean...

724
00:50:29,256 --> 00:50:30,674
I'm happy to hear that.

725
00:50:30,757 --> 00:50:31,756
What is your plan?

726
00:50:33,175 --> 00:50:34,634
I'll do it at the inauguration.

727
00:50:34,717 --> 00:50:37,302
Really? Same place
you were going to kill the president?

728
00:50:38,262 --> 00:50:40,555
If everybody thinks
I'm gonna kill the president,

729
00:50:40,638 --> 00:50:43,056
no one will suspect
my actual objective.

730
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,933
And with Masovich's bodyguards
all outside during the party,

731
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,561
he will be at his most vulnerable.
Are you sure it will work?

732
00:50:51,144 --> 00:50:53,354
Already did. Islamabad, '02.

733
00:50:53,896 --> 00:50:57,023
Afghan arms dealer never made it home
from the state dinner.

734
00:50:57,356 --> 00:50:59,983
I like how you think.
He's talking about Chapter 12.

735
00:51:00,066 --> 00:51:03,110
Why would an actual assassin write a book
about being an assassin?

736
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:06,779
It's beyond stupid.
Or is it so beyond stupid it's brilliant?

737
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:09,197
No, it's just stupid. That's it.

738
00:51:09,281 --> 00:51:11,615
Look, I'm taking this guy off the board,
all right?

739
00:51:11,699 --> 00:51:14,868
I'm gonna go get the C-4.
Oh, don't start with the C-4.

740
00:51:14,951 --> 00:51:16,159
We can't kill an American.

741
00:51:17,286 --> 00:51:18,285
Well...

742
00:51:20,245 --> 00:51:21,329
not directly.

743
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:23,706
Traitor!

744
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,540
He is an international assassin.

745
00:51:25,623 --> 00:51:27,875
Of course he's gonna go
with the highest bidder.

746
00:51:28,083 --> 00:51:30,335
And right now, that's General Ruiz.

747
00:51:30,543 --> 00:51:32,003
You really should read his book.

748
00:51:33,837 --> 00:51:36,714
I want every cop in the city
looking for that pig.

749
00:51:36,797 --> 00:51:37,923
And when they find him,

750
00:51:38,506 --> 00:51:40,966
I want him to die a long, painful death.

751
00:51:41,049 --> 00:51:42,551
Understood.
And tell Paolo

752
00:51:42,634 --> 00:51:44,886
to bring me another Zima
and clean this up.

753
00:51:45,511 --> 00:51:46,761
You killed Paolo, Jefe.

754
00:51:50,764 --> 00:51:52,682
What the hell, Anton?

755
00:51:52,765 --> 00:51:55,183
You can't just shoot someone
in front of us.

756
00:51:55,267 --> 00:51:56,934
At least wait until we leave.

757
00:51:57,810 --> 00:51:58,809
Damn!

758
00:52:00,061 --> 00:52:02,354
All right. Whole night's ruined.

759
00:52:03,855 --> 00:52:04,939
That's just...

760
00:52:05,273 --> 00:52:07,107
Something is wrong with you.
I know.

761
00:52:07,191 --> 00:52:09,233
In the head.
It's not even...

762
00:52:25,952 --> 00:52:28,287
How did you get here?
Did anyone spot you?

763
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:30,163
Well, why don't you take a look at me,

764
00:52:30,246 --> 00:52:32,998
and then take a look at everybody else
who lives here?

765
00:52:33,081 --> 00:52:35,082
I'm gonna say,
yeah, I think I was spotted.

766
00:52:42,046 --> 00:52:43,045
Here you go.

767
00:52:44,047 --> 00:52:45,547
I could've done that myself.

768
00:52:45,631 --> 00:52:47,673
I opened it for you. It's not a big thing.

769
00:52:51,676 --> 00:52:53,677
So, this is your case against
Masovich, huh?

770
00:52:53,761 --> 00:52:54,970
Five years of my life.

771
00:52:55,053 --> 00:52:57,180
It looks a lot like my place.

772
00:52:57,721 --> 00:52:59,681
Yeah, except the stuff on my walls
is real.

773
00:52:59,765 --> 00:53:01,515
Yeah? How's this for real?

774
00:53:01,891 --> 00:53:04,309
I just met with the president's
number one adviser.

775
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:05,976
General Ruiz?
Mm-hm.

776
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:09,437
How did you get a meeting with him?
How I get most of my meetings here.

777
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,562
I was abducted.

778
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:13,714
Guess who he wants me to eliminate
at the inauguration ball.

779
00:53:14,815 --> 00:53:15,815
Masovich.

780
00:53:15,899 --> 00:53:18,068
Bingo-vich.

781
00:53:27,323 --> 00:53:28,907
Allí arriba.

782
00:53:31,283 --> 00:53:34,786
So, I gotta ask, why are you
so obsessed with taking down Masovich?

783
00:53:34,869 --> 00:53:37,955
The country would be a lot better off
with him behind bars and...

784
00:53:38,205 --> 00:53:41,456
President Cueto out of power.
I mean, why you?

785
00:53:44,041 --> 00:53:45,542
Because my parents grew up here.

786
00:53:48,336 --> 00:53:50,212
Because the DEA assumed I'd fail.

787
00:53:54,089 --> 00:53:56,383
And honestly, because if I don't do it...

788
00:53:57,633 --> 00:53:58,884
who will?
It just...

789
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:03,387
It just seems so dangerous, you know?
You're down here by yourself and...

790
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:05,388
Is it really worth risking your life?

791
00:54:08,515 --> 00:54:09,723
We're all gonna die.

792
00:54:12,517 --> 00:54:14,726
Not all of us get to make a difference.

793
00:54:18,229 --> 00:54:19,729
I know I certainly haven't.

794
00:54:29,903 --> 00:54:32,570
If I could get the president to admit,
on tape,

795
00:54:32,654 --> 00:54:34,489
to ordering the hit on Masovich,

796
00:54:34,572 --> 00:54:37,449
I could probably get them
to turn against each other.

797
00:54:37,533 --> 00:54:39,409
Maybe get one of them to flip.

798
00:54:40,034 --> 00:54:42,077
You're definitely gonna get yourself
killed.

799
00:54:46,663 --> 00:54:48,330
I'm not talking about me.

800
00:54:48,414 --> 00:54:49,707
You.

801
00:54:50,332 --> 00:54:53,583
Tomorrow night at the inauguration,
wearing a wire.

802
00:54:53,667 --> 00:54:55,626
Oh, no, no, no.
This could be your chance

803
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:57,211
to start making a difference.

804
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,130
I promise...

805
00:55:01,463 --> 00:55:03,007
I won't let anything happen to you.

806
00:55:05,924 --> 00:55:07,426
My shoulder!
Get down!

807
00:55:07,509 --> 00:55:09,427
I got shot! I got shot!

808
00:55:18,266 --> 00:55:21,350
What about not letting anything
happen to me? I'm dying. I'm dying.

809
00:55:21,434 --> 00:55:23,269
You're not dying. Shut up!
You shut...

810
00:55:23,352 --> 00:55:25,061
Ever been shot before?
Yeah, twice.

811
00:55:25,145 --> 00:55:28,105
Yeah, I got shot square.
Okay, I'm definitely dying.

812
00:55:28,188 --> 00:55:29,188
I can't feel my thumb.

813
00:55:49,368 --> 00:55:50,618
What the hell?
Go!

814
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:55,620
Come on.

815
00:55:56,831 --> 00:55:57,830
Let's go.

816
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:03,625
Huh?

817
00:56:04,336 --> 00:56:05,335
No!

818
00:56:08,212 --> 00:56:09,212
Hurry up!

819
00:56:10,088 --> 00:56:12,257
Come on. I've got a go-bag at the mission.

820
00:56:18,761 --> 00:56:19,678
So, let me guess.

821
00:56:19,762 --> 00:56:23,680
The hero from your book
used that trick with the lamp.

822
00:56:23,764 --> 00:56:25,140
Well, no.

823
00:56:25,681 --> 00:56:28,558
The last actuary table I ran
was on home electrical fires.

824
00:56:28,641 --> 00:56:32,186
So, we can thank Trent's d-pic.

825
00:56:33,227 --> 00:56:34,479
That sounds very, very weird.

826
00:56:34,562 --> 00:56:38,564
Um... 'Cause you don't know Trent.
And it's weird on its own.

827
00:56:42,942 --> 00:56:45,235
Wouldn't a hospital be better?

828
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:47,278
Can't go to a hospital.

829
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:49,321
You don't get it, do you?

830
00:56:49,404 --> 00:56:50,989
Those guys were cops.

831
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:52,782
Masovich owns this city.

832
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,700
I wasn't joking when I said
the DEA wrote me off.

833
00:56:58,494 --> 00:57:00,745
I've been down here on my own forever.

834
00:57:02,871 --> 00:57:06,290
I don't have any more resources.
That was my last safe house.

835
00:57:08,416 --> 00:57:11,626
Well, then, how would I be getting
to the inauguration?

836
00:57:13,127 --> 00:57:14,206
What are you talking about?

837
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:15,920
I'll do it.

838
00:57:16,921 --> 00:57:17,921
I'll wear a wire.

839
00:57:20,173 --> 00:57:23,550
No, you were right. It's too dangerous.
We gotta get you out of here.

840
00:57:23,634 --> 00:57:25,343
Mission's over.
Mission is not over.

841
00:57:25,426 --> 00:57:28,095
The Ghost doesn't just walk away.
You are not the Ghost.

842
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:30,930
You said, "Get out of your head
and get in the game."

843
00:57:31,013 --> 00:57:32,472
Sam, we almost died tonight.

844
00:57:32,555 --> 00:57:33,723
We're all gonna die.

845
00:57:35,307 --> 00:57:37,308
Not all of us get to make a difference.

846
00:57:40,352 --> 00:57:43,854
We'd need a small army to protect us
while we got ready.

847
00:57:47,399 --> 00:57:49,108
I think I know where to find one.

848
00:58:07,911 --> 00:58:09,370
Tell El Toro the Ghost is here.

849
00:58:15,832 --> 00:58:16,874
It is the Ghost.

850
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:18,749
The one and only.

851
00:58:19,251 --> 00:58:21,502
And you, who is this?

852
00:58:22,044 --> 00:58:23,087
Rosa Bolivar.

853
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:26,130
DEA, idealist, patriot.

854
00:58:26,213 --> 00:58:28,714
She's a badass.
She's a big fan of yours, too.

855
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:30,967
You know? Yeah.
Seems very nice.

856
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:32,551
My shoulder, man! I got shot.

857
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:35,636
Qué Bonita.

858
00:58:35,719 --> 00:58:38,012
I have thousands of followers
all over Venezuela,

859
00:58:38,096 --> 00:58:40,264
but I cannot think of anybody
as beautiful as you.

860
00:58:40,347 --> 00:58:43,433
Yes. Muy Bonita, we get it. Okay.
Let's focus on what's important.

861
00:58:44,057 --> 00:58:46,725
Yours truly just received
a personal invite to...

862
00:58:47,393 --> 00:58:48,853
a certain black-tie event.

863
00:58:50,437 --> 00:58:51,937
You see? What did I tell you?

864
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:53,230
That's right, Juan.

865
00:58:53,814 --> 00:58:54,814
The plan is in motion.

866
00:58:55,857 --> 00:58:58,400
Tomorrow I'll be in position
to take out el Presidente.

867
00:58:58,692 --> 00:59:00,276
But there is one catch.

868
00:59:00,901 --> 00:59:03,570
Anton Masovich is trying to kill us.
The Russian Moby?

869
00:59:03,653 --> 00:59:05,154
Yeah.
Screw him.

870
00:59:05,237 --> 00:59:08,196
If you want me to take out the president,
I need your men to keep us alive.

871
00:59:08,698 --> 00:59:10,282
Anything for you, friend.
Yeah.

872
00:59:10,365 --> 00:59:11,366
Anything.
All right.

873
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:12,700
Anything for you. Come.

874
00:59:12,783 --> 00:59:14,326
Mi casa es Su casa.

875
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:15,452
We got our small army.

876
00:59:15,535 --> 00:59:17,294
Let's get you ready
for the ball, Cinderella.

877
00:59:20,663 --> 00:59:23,582
No one's gonna be able
to bring a weapon into the palace, so...

878
00:59:23,665 --> 00:59:26,876
if you can steal one of these
from the presidential guard, use it.

879
00:59:26,959 --> 00:59:27,958
Let's see.

880
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:33,880
You're a good shot.
I've spent time at the range.

881
00:59:33,963 --> 00:59:34,964
Don't get me wrong.

882
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:37,591
You're good,
but you're not as good as me.

883
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:39,216
Oh, really?
Yeah, really.

884
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:40,675
Why don't you try this on?

885
00:59:43,385 --> 00:59:44,803
Okay, that's really cool.

886
00:59:44,887 --> 00:59:47,555
But not practical.
No, you could use that in the field.

887
00:59:47,638 --> 00:59:49,556
Bullshit.
I used it in my book.

888
00:59:50,723 --> 00:59:54,225
Sam, what we're about to do is...
I know.

889
00:59:55,893 --> 00:59:58,394
It's not a book.
Let's just call it a night.

890
01:00:04,231 --> 01:00:05,231
Wait a second.

891
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,401
You're worried about me.
No.

892
01:00:08,942 --> 01:00:09,942
Yeah.

893
01:00:10,652 --> 01:00:13,070
That's why you're a one-woman operation.

894
01:00:13,654 --> 01:00:15,906
Why you push people away
with the nicknames.

895
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:20,033
If you're on your own, you don't
have to worry about losing anyone.

896
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:21,700
You can't get hurt.

897
01:00:24,118 --> 01:00:25,203
How did you know?

898
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,120
I'm a writer.

899
01:00:29,205 --> 01:00:30,581
I notice the details.

900
01:00:40,545 --> 01:00:43,964
It was just really hard
when my first partner died.

901
01:00:45,715 --> 01:00:46,799
I'm really sorry.

902
01:00:53,637 --> 01:00:56,388
Then I lost two more
in just one year.

903
01:00:57,889 --> 01:00:58,889
Three?

904
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:01,016
Three of them died?

905
01:01:01,099 --> 01:01:02,517
I mean, three here.

906
01:01:04,477 --> 01:01:08,729
But before that, I lost two
while I was on assignment in Mexico.

907
01:01:11,022 --> 01:01:13,690
Five of your partners,
they're dead? Five of them?

908
01:01:14,316 --> 01:01:18,610
They call me the jinx back in D.C.
No one will work with me.

909
01:01:18,693 --> 01:01:19,693
Hey, hey, hey.

910
01:01:19,736 --> 01:01:22,571
Come on, don't cry.
Everyone who touches me dies.

911
01:01:31,243 --> 01:01:32,994
You're messing with me, aren't you?

912
01:01:36,538 --> 01:01:38,164
Thought you noticed the details.

913
01:01:39,248 --> 01:01:41,082
You are good.

914
01:01:41,165 --> 01:01:42,792
Hell, yeah, I am. Pack this up.

915
01:01:43,458 --> 01:01:44,458
Let's go.

916
01:02:01,678 --> 01:02:03,179
My kind of gal.

917
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:09,933
They disappeared into the jungle.

918
01:02:10,517 --> 01:02:13,686
Two of our men tried to follow them,
but they were gunned down.

919
01:02:16,646 --> 01:02:17,645
El Toro.

920
01:02:23,358 --> 01:02:27,735
I pay you a lot of money,
and you have failed me again.

921
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:34,073
Next time I see the Ghost
and that DEA bitch...

922
01:02:38,534 --> 01:02:40,159
I'm gonna kill 'em myself.

923
01:02:50,874 --> 01:02:53,084
Thank you.
De nada.

924
01:02:53,167 --> 01:02:55,128
Ah.

925
01:02:56,587 --> 01:02:58,254
Let's get a move on, cupcake.

926
01:03:00,547 --> 01:03:02,048
From my private collection.

927
01:03:04,425 --> 01:03:06,718
Listen, I know you don't need the luck.

928
01:03:06,801 --> 01:03:08,176
But I will say break a leg.

929
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:09,261
The president's leg.

930
01:03:09,511 --> 01:03:11,512
Then, his other leg.

931
01:03:11,637 --> 01:03:15,056
And then, carefully but painfully,
rip out his still beating heart,

932
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:18,641
and hoist it above his corpse
like this for the entire party to see.

933
01:03:19,851 --> 01:03:21,643
I was thinking something
maybe quicker.

934
01:03:21,727 --> 01:03:23,103
Whatever works for you.

935
01:03:23,186 --> 01:03:24,185
Until next we meet.

936
01:03:27,689 --> 01:03:29,231
I can do that myself.

937
01:03:29,815 --> 01:03:31,941
I opened it for you. It's not a big thing.

938
01:03:39,404 --> 01:03:40,404
Stay close to them.

939
01:03:40,989 --> 01:03:42,531
Let me know when it is done.

940
01:03:43,824 --> 01:03:46,409
Tonight... we take back our country.

941
01:03:48,827 --> 01:03:49,826
It's my country.

942
01:04:07,421 --> 01:04:10,006
Isn't El Toro gonna be pissed
when I don't do what I said?

943
01:04:10,089 --> 01:04:12,758
Once the president's prosecuted,
his corruption's exposed,

944
01:04:12,841 --> 01:04:13,925
El Toro will thank you.

945
01:04:14,593 --> 01:04:16,427
Testing, testing. Uno, dos, tres.

946
01:04:17,969 --> 01:04:19,596
Testing, testing. Uno, dos, tres.

947
01:04:20,179 --> 01:04:23,806
Remember, I need the president confessing
to ordering the hit on Masovich.

948
01:04:23,890 --> 01:04:25,432
Is that all?
Don't get killed.

949
01:04:26,099 --> 01:04:28,684
Like my other five partners.
You were messing with me.

950
01:04:28,768 --> 01:04:29,768
Was I?

951
01:04:29,852 --> 01:04:31,394
Don't you start with that.

952
01:04:41,609 --> 01:04:42,860
You go left, I'll go right.

953
01:04:42,943 --> 01:04:46,403
Locate the president, and meet
back here before you make contact.

954
01:04:48,696 --> 01:04:50,822
I trust all is proceeding to plan.

955
01:04:51,448 --> 01:04:54,200
Tomorrow our Russian friend won't
be feeling very good.

956
01:04:54,283 --> 01:04:55,576
Because he'll be dead.

957
01:04:56,701 --> 01:04:58,369
That's what I was going for, yeah.

958
01:05:04,331 --> 01:05:05,916
So clumsy of me.

959
01:05:05,999 --> 01:05:07,500
I think I've had one too many.

960
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:08,958
Thank you, my friend.

961
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:40,770
Anton.

962
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:41,896
Let's dance.

963
01:05:42,938 --> 01:05:44,398
I thought you'd never ask.

964
01:05:50,234 --> 01:05:51,234
Thank you.

965
01:05:54,362 --> 01:05:55,361
I'll take that, sir.

966
01:05:57,822 --> 01:05:58,822
Juan.

967
01:05:59,699 --> 01:06:00,740
How did you get in?

968
01:06:00,824 --> 01:06:03,503
I'm more capable than El Toro thinks.
I'm glad you're here, man.

969
01:06:04,243 --> 01:06:07,120
I'm freaking out.
You will kill the president tonight.

970
01:06:07,203 --> 01:06:08,912
Yeah, of course.
Otherwise, I will.

971
01:06:08,995 --> 01:06:10,413
And then I'll kill you.

972
01:06:16,291 --> 01:06:18,418
Come on, man. Oh, come on now. Kylie.

973
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,461
If you don't hear from me,
I'm so gonna die.

974
01:06:28,424 --> 01:06:29,424
Tango.

975
01:06:29,466 --> 01:06:32,093
The vertical expression
of a horizontal act.

976
01:06:34,219 --> 01:06:35,721
Hello.
Ghost Face Killer.

977
01:06:35,804 --> 01:06:36,637
Got your text.

978
01:06:36,762 --> 01:06:39,431
You're kidding, right?
Kylie, it's not a good time.

979
01:06:41,265 --> 01:06:44,642
Unh!
I'll get you horizontal, but in a box.

980
01:06:48,769 --> 01:06:49,812
I forgot to ask.

981
01:06:49,895 --> 01:06:52,147
Where's the manuscript
for your next book?

982
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:53,064
Oh, no.

983
01:06:53,148 --> 01:06:54,648
I can't do this right now.

984
01:06:59,317 --> 01:07:00,819
Shall we take this upstairs?

985
01:07:00,902 --> 01:07:02,695
Ooh. You about to assassinate someone?

986
01:07:02,778 --> 01:07:03,946
I gotta go.

987
01:07:04,029 --> 01:07:04,863
I gotta go.

988
01:07:04,946 --> 01:07:06,905
Could this guy be more
of a mouth breather?

989
01:07:06,989 --> 01:07:10,408
Well, I think his everyday Joe appearance
is all a part of his cover.

990
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:15,077
Think about it. You'd never suspect a guy
who looks like that is an assassin.

991
01:07:15,828 --> 01:07:17,787
Which makes him the perfect assassin.

992
01:07:18,913 --> 01:07:20,289
You think this guy's the Ghost?

993
01:07:21,248 --> 01:07:24,000
I'll bet you a year's salary
he kills the president tonight.

994
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:29,003
Easiest 17 grand I ever made.
Yeah.

995
01:07:34,548 --> 01:07:35,547
Mr. President.

996
01:07:36,215 --> 01:07:37,215
Oh.

997
01:07:37,883 --> 01:07:39,301
A fellow American. How nice.

998
01:07:39,676 --> 01:07:43,136
Don't you just hate the food here?
I mean, it's all Mexican.

999
01:07:43,219 --> 01:07:46,930
Man, I would just kill for some
of them mini hot dogs right about now.

1000
01:07:47,014 --> 01:07:48,013
Hey, Juan.

1001
01:07:49,974 --> 01:07:51,016
You know him?

1002
01:07:51,099 --> 01:07:53,267
I call them all Juan.
Half the time, I'm right.

1003
01:07:53,350 --> 01:07:54,810
Juan Valdez, go to the kitchen.

1004
01:07:54,894 --> 01:07:57,228
Order me up some of them
pigs in a blanket.

1005
01:07:57,312 --> 01:07:59,688
Pronto.
Gracias. Hombre.

1006
01:08:05,484 --> 01:08:06,859
I know you.

1007
01:08:07,067 --> 01:08:08,110
I do.

1008
01:08:08,193 --> 01:08:11,403
You're that author
that Katie Couric outed.

1009
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:13,571
Man, you, you and Sarah Palin.

1010
01:08:13,654 --> 01:08:16,740
That KC, she's the real assassin, huh?

1011
01:08:16,823 --> 01:08:19,867
Have you seen the Auto-Tune they did
of your interview on YouTube?

1012
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:20,993
No, but you know what?

1013
01:08:21,075 --> 01:08:23,036
Maybe you have an office you can show me?

1014
01:08:23,119 --> 01:08:24,703
Dude, yes. Come.

1015
01:08:29,247 --> 01:08:30,332
Will this work?

1016
01:08:30,415 --> 01:08:32,625
I hope they can get blood
out of the carpet.

1017
01:08:44,507 --> 01:08:47,550
Mr. President, I was hoping
to talk to you about Anton Masovich.

1018
01:08:47,634 --> 01:08:48,634
Sí.

1019
01:08:48,676 --> 01:08:51,678
I made sure I had Zima
for that little pain in the ass.

1020
01:08:51,803 --> 01:08:55,764
Man, I so hate all of this.

1021
01:08:56,389 --> 01:08:59,766
There are times when I really wanna
put a gun in my mouth.

1022
01:09:00,016 --> 01:09:01,616
Have you had a job like that, americano?

1023
01:09:02,434 --> 01:09:03,894
Actually, I did.

1024
01:09:09,105 --> 01:09:11,482
I wish you'd take a bribe like the others.

1025
01:09:11,565 --> 01:09:13,358
Sorry, I'm not that kind of girl.

1026
01:09:28,867 --> 01:09:30,202
Gracias, put down.

1027
01:09:30,284 --> 01:09:31,284
I'm starving.

1028
01:09:33,578 --> 01:09:34,578
Juan.

1029
01:09:34,913 --> 01:09:35,955
Cerveza.

1030
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:37,623
Pardonnez-moi.
S'il vous plaît.

1031
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:38,790
Ciao, ciao.

1032
01:09:38,873 --> 01:09:39,873
Of course, señor.

1033
01:09:44,043 --> 01:09:47,838
What if I could make
your Masovich problem go away?

1034
01:09:47,921 --> 01:09:48,920
Pig?

1035
01:09:50,089 --> 01:09:52,131
You mean, like, go away forever?

1036
01:09:53,799 --> 01:09:54,842
Just say the word.

1037
01:09:59,052 --> 01:10:00,470
I don't care you're a woman.

1038
01:10:00,554 --> 01:10:02,137
I'm still gonna kill you.

1039
01:10:04,681 --> 01:10:06,720
Good to know you're
an equal opportunity douche bag.

1040
01:10:39,035 --> 01:10:41,537
Didn't General Ruiz
already talk to you about this?

1041
01:10:42,287 --> 01:10:44,830
Talk to me about what?
The thing.

1042
01:10:45,789 --> 01:10:46,874
What thing?
The thing.

1043
01:10:46,957 --> 01:10:48,958
The thing that you're asking me about.

1044
01:10:49,791 --> 01:10:51,167
I was asking you about...

1045
01:10:51,543 --> 01:10:53,752
what?
About our little friend.

1046
01:10:53,836 --> 01:10:55,128
Which one?

1047
01:10:55,211 --> 01:10:56,546
Masovich.

1048
01:10:57,171 --> 01:11:01,007
Oh. So, you're saying, if I'm clear...
I want you to kill Masovich!

1049
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,216
What is wrong with you?
Nothing is wrong.

1050
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:06,093
Everything is great in the world.
Wait.

1051
01:11:07,094 --> 01:11:08,887
Sorry?
Is that a wire?

1052
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:11,471
Huh?
In your shirt there. No, there.

1053
01:11:11,555 --> 01:11:13,431
No, no. No, no. No, no.
No?

1054
01:11:13,514 --> 01:11:16,266
No, no, no. No, no, no.
It's an iPhone headset.

1055
01:11:16,349 --> 01:11:18,726
But I see it in your shirt.
It's a music...

1056
01:11:18,809 --> 01:11:19,809
No!

1057
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:29,440
That...

1058
01:11:30,816 --> 01:11:32,693
is definitely a wire.

1059
01:11:42,282 --> 01:11:43,282
Come on!

1060
01:11:48,578 --> 01:11:49,578
It's okay.

1061
01:11:51,163 --> 01:11:52,162
It is?

1062
01:11:53,623 --> 01:11:54,664
Yeah, it's okay.

1063
01:11:58,417 --> 01:11:59,416
I knew...

1064
01:12:00,251 --> 01:12:03,170
that this was gonna happen eventually.
That I would get caught.

1065
01:12:03,253 --> 01:12:05,129
Man, I hate this place.

1066
01:12:05,713 --> 01:12:07,797
I so miss San Diego
and the perfect weather.

1067
01:12:07,881 --> 01:12:09,465
Instead, I'm stuck with this.

1068
01:12:10,007 --> 01:12:11,091
And I can't get out.

1069
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,968
I hate all of this.
I hate the people, I hate the food. I...

1070
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:17,970
hate that lion, the way it looks at me.
And I hate soccer.

1071
01:12:18,596 --> 01:12:19,804
Go Padres.

1072
01:12:22,306 --> 01:12:23,390
I hate my life.

1073
01:12:25,642 --> 01:12:26,809
And most of all...

1074
01:12:28,685 --> 01:12:29,770
I hate myself.

1075
01:12:30,895 --> 01:12:32,063
Hey.

1076
01:12:32,271 --> 01:12:33,647
Hey, hey, hey.

1077
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:36,941
This is not the end of the world.

1078
01:12:39,067 --> 01:12:41,151
Lift your head up, and you look at me.

1079
01:12:42,069 --> 01:12:47,197
Now, I'm telling you, I got caught
doing something wrong, too.

1080
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:52,075
But I'm gonna tell you,
I am a better person now.

1081
01:12:53,075 --> 01:12:57,161
Okay, you can still make a difference.

1082
01:13:00,121 --> 01:13:01,413
It's too late for that.

1083
01:13:01,497 --> 01:13:02,748
That's a big misconception.

1084
01:13:02,831 --> 01:13:04,499
I'm... Oh, my God, that's a gun.

1085
01:13:04,582 --> 01:13:06,625
No, please. No, no, stop, please. No!

1086
01:13:14,964 --> 01:13:16,047
Oh, this is bad.

1087
01:13:16,589 --> 01:13:17,757
This is very bad.

1088
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:22,843
Help!
You shot him?

1089
01:13:22,927 --> 01:13:24,094
No!
Is he dead?

1090
01:13:24,177 --> 01:13:25,845
I think he's still breathing.
You!

1091
01:13:29,806 --> 01:13:30,806
What do I do?

1092
01:13:31,224 --> 01:13:32,849
I don't know. CPR?

1093
01:13:35,768 --> 01:13:36,851
I don't know CPR!

1094
01:13:36,935 --> 01:13:38,853
How do you not know?
You know everything.

1095
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:42,063
Yeah, about taking lives, not saving them.

1096
01:13:47,566 --> 01:13:48,693
Give me the gun.

1097
01:13:51,236 --> 01:13:52,736
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1098
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:54,071
Say good night, bitch!

1099
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:57,781
Good night, bitch.

1100
01:14:07,787 --> 01:14:10,747
Arrest that man for the assassination
of President Cueto.

1101
01:14:14,875 --> 01:14:17,168
I didn't do anything. I did not do it.

1102
01:14:20,545 --> 01:14:21,545
He did it.

1103
01:14:22,255 --> 01:14:24,715
That son of a bitch actually did it.

1104
01:14:25,256 --> 01:14:26,424
Pay up.

1105
01:14:48,229 --> 01:14:49,396
¡Que viva la revolución!

1106
01:14:49,479 --> 01:14:50,731
¡El Toro!

1107
01:14:50,814 --> 01:14:53,690
¡El Toro! ¡El Toro! ¡El Toro!

1108
01:15:39,676 --> 01:15:41,678
Ghost, you did it.

1109
01:15:43,804 --> 01:15:47,182
El Toro, what are you doing here?
There is nothing to worry about.

1110
01:15:47,265 --> 01:15:49,725
I have made a deal with General Ruiz.

1111
01:15:50,433 --> 01:15:52,476
And Juan here,
he has something to tell you.

1112
01:15:52,559 --> 01:15:54,770
Oh. No, no, hey.

1113
01:15:54,978 --> 01:15:56,645
We don't need to do this.
Tell him.

1114
01:15:58,563 --> 01:15:59,563
Tell him.

1115
01:16:01,315 --> 01:16:03,232
I doubted you the whole time, but...

1116
01:16:04,692 --> 01:16:05,609
I was wrong.

1117
01:16:05,692 --> 01:16:07,902
You are... him.

1118
01:16:09,612 --> 01:16:10,611
Him who?

1119
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:13,906
The Ghost.
Yes, the Ghost.

1120
01:16:14,615 --> 01:16:16,199
And as to you, Agent Bolivar,

1121
01:16:16,282 --> 01:16:19,076
I hope he was right when he said
that you are a patriot.

1122
01:16:19,618 --> 01:16:22,078
Will you help me
make a real difference here?

1123
01:16:24,412 --> 01:16:25,996
I will.
Fantastic.

1124
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:29,415
Juan is gonna take you up to the compound
and bring you up to speed.

1125
01:16:29,749 --> 01:16:32,959
Your input will be very valuable to me.

1126
01:16:33,626 --> 01:16:35,377
Thank you.
De nada.

1127
01:16:35,461 --> 01:16:37,003
Juan, please, take her.

1128
01:16:37,378 --> 01:16:38,463
And you, my friend.

1129
01:16:39,338 --> 01:16:40,631
You will ride with me.

1130
01:16:42,006 --> 01:16:43,882
For we have much to talk about.

1131
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:49,010
Wow. So, this is a revolution, huh?

1132
01:16:50,595 --> 01:16:52,638
Man, I'm really starting
to like Venezuela.

1133
01:16:53,305 --> 01:16:55,473
Maybe I'll even get a timeshare.

1134
01:16:57,140 --> 01:16:58,140
Or not.

1135
01:16:58,975 --> 01:16:59,974
Either way.

1136
01:17:00,810 --> 01:17:02,894
I'm really sorry to do this, Fantasma.

1137
01:17:04,062 --> 01:17:05,061
What...?

1138
01:17:05,229 --> 01:17:08,564
What about
the whole us-riding-together thing?

1139
01:17:08,648 --> 01:17:11,233
You know too much.
Now you must die. But...

1140
01:17:12,441 --> 01:17:14,526
you will live in our hearts
and minds forever.

1141
01:17:17,194 --> 01:17:18,028
But I'll be dead.

1142
01:17:18,112 --> 01:17:19,862
But you will live forever.

1143
01:17:20,279 --> 01:17:22,656
You will be a legend.
We will write songs about you.

1144
01:17:22,739 --> 01:17:24,157
But I won't be here.

1145
01:17:24,241 --> 01:17:26,200
Murals will be painted in your honor.

1146
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:29,119
Children will be singing
and dancing in the street,

1147
01:17:29,202 --> 01:17:30,119
praising your name.

1148
01:17:30,202 --> 01:17:32,954
I understand that...
You will be an icon of the revolution,

1149
01:17:33,037 --> 01:17:36,081
worshiped for generations to come.
Yes, but I will be dead.

1150
01:17:36,164 --> 01:17:37,457
Yes, you will be dead.

1151
01:17:37,706 --> 01:17:40,000
Put the weapon down, El Toro.

1152
01:17:41,668 --> 01:17:42,710
CIA.

1153
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:44,460
CIA.

1154
01:17:44,962 --> 01:17:47,255
We're part of the deal
with your buddy, Ruiz.

1155
01:17:47,338 --> 01:17:49,256
And I'm gonna need this one alive.

1156
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:52,299
I need him dead.
Actually, you don't.

1157
01:17:52,842 --> 01:17:54,384
State Department just called.

1158
01:17:54,467 --> 01:17:56,552
Sam Larson's getting a free pass home.

1159
01:17:57,136 --> 01:17:58,469
We're as shocked as you are.

1160
01:17:58,553 --> 01:18:00,762
But he knows too much.
He will tell everyone.

1161
01:18:00,846 --> 01:18:03,806
No one's gonna believe him. He's a fraud.
Wait.

1162
01:18:05,307 --> 01:18:07,267
A fraud? What do you mean?

1163
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:09,268
His book. It was bullshit.

1164
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:11,394
He's not the Ghost.

1165
01:18:11,477 --> 01:18:13,104
He's just some... loser.

1166
01:18:14,354 --> 01:18:15,354
I tried to tell you.

1167
01:18:18,648 --> 01:18:19,648
You lied to me?

1168
01:18:20,650 --> 01:18:23,277
No, you...
You just assumed, you know.

1169
01:18:28,363 --> 01:18:29,947
I was gonna write songs about you.

1170
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:33,407
All right. Let's go.

1171
01:18:38,661 --> 01:18:40,829
That's enough.
Beautiful songs!

1172
01:18:40,912 --> 01:18:42,872
Okay, if he starts singing, shoot him.

1173
01:18:42,955 --> 01:18:43,955
Got it.

1174
01:18:48,375 --> 01:18:50,418
Something about this
doesn't feel right.

1175
01:18:50,501 --> 01:18:51,501
You're telling me.

1176
01:18:52,169 --> 01:18:54,045
Who do you know
in the State Department?

1177
01:18:54,129 --> 01:18:55,212
I'm talking about Rosa.

1178
01:18:55,296 --> 01:18:59,007
I mean, if El Toro was gonna kill me,
how do I know she's gonna be all right?

1179
01:18:59,090 --> 01:19:00,174
She probably won't be.

1180
01:19:10,930 --> 01:19:12,764
You guys are gonna help her out, right?

1181
01:19:12,848 --> 01:19:14,391
She's DEA. Different team.

1182
01:19:14,933 --> 01:19:17,185
But she's making a difference.
She's making a mess.

1183
01:19:17,268 --> 01:19:19,561
Why do you think we made
the last DEA agent assigned here

1184
01:19:19,644 --> 01:19:21,020
eat a C-4 sandwich?

1185
01:19:26,315 --> 01:19:28,149
My parents died when I was a little boy.

1186
01:19:28,774 --> 01:19:31,151
In many ways,
El Toro has been like a father to me.

1187
01:19:32,485 --> 01:19:34,403
Just as you will be to all of our people.

1188
01:19:34,904 --> 01:19:36,446
This country needs a change.

1189
01:19:36,529 --> 01:19:37,697
Yes, it does.

1190
01:19:39,364 --> 01:19:40,365
Thanks for waiting.

1191
01:19:42,742 --> 01:19:44,409
If you actually want my help...

1192
01:19:44,951 --> 01:19:45,993
it was worth the wait.

1193
01:19:46,994 --> 01:19:49,495
I can assure you that my plans
won't work without you.

1194
01:19:50,413 --> 01:19:52,581
Let's go. Don't look at him. Come on.

1195
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:57,042
I read the book. Real page-turner.

1196
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:02,879
Your flight leaves in 20 minutes.
Get on it, and never come back.

1197
01:20:03,379 --> 01:20:04,378
No.

1198
01:20:04,588 --> 01:20:06,923
I'm not leaving until I know Rosa's okay.

1199
01:20:07,173 --> 01:20:09,758
You might not have her back, but I do.

1200
01:20:09,841 --> 01:20:11,634
Why?
Because she had mine.

1201
01:20:11,717 --> 01:20:13,302
Whoa.
What? You wanna stop me?

1202
01:20:14,302 --> 01:20:16,137
This is going to the New York Times.

1203
01:20:16,678 --> 01:20:19,222
Why do you think
we made the last DEA agent

1204
01:20:19,305 --> 01:20:20,932
assigned here eat a C-4 sandwich?

1205
01:20:21,848 --> 01:20:24,600
You know, Larson,
you may have everybody else fooled,

1206
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:26,769
but we both know you're a fake.

1207
01:20:26,852 --> 01:20:28,311
So, get your ass on that plane,

1208
01:20:28,853 --> 01:20:30,532
and back to writing
other people's stories.

1209
01:20:31,772 --> 01:20:32,771
Or...

1210
01:20:33,231 --> 01:20:34,773
I could start living my own.

1211
01:20:40,985 --> 01:20:43,028
Final chapter. You rot in jail.

1212
01:20:43,111 --> 01:20:46,447
Get everyone back.
Official government business.

1213
01:20:53,159 --> 01:20:54,159
Keys.

1214
01:20:55,994 --> 01:20:58,746
Final chapter. I save the girl.

1215
01:21:22,344 --> 01:21:23,343
You know...

1216
01:21:25,513 --> 01:21:27,764
he might actually be the Ghost.
Heh.

1217
01:21:32,517 --> 01:21:34,643
Masovich was a very smart businessman.

1218
01:21:35,227 --> 01:21:37,853
He kept a very tight lid
on his drug trafficking routes.

1219
01:21:37,937 --> 01:21:40,897
So much so that General Ruiz
didn't even know how he did it.

1220
01:21:42,064 --> 01:21:43,064
But you...

1221
01:21:44,148 --> 01:21:46,942
You are the woman
that has been studying him for five years.

1222
01:21:47,025 --> 01:21:48,735
Watching every move that he makes.

1223
01:21:49,318 --> 01:21:50,987
So, you know it all.

1224
01:21:53,405 --> 01:21:54,404
You know.

1225
01:21:54,697 --> 01:21:55,864
Just like you know

1226
01:21:56,656 --> 01:21:58,616
that he ran a billion-dollar business.

1227
01:21:59,324 --> 01:22:00,324
An empire...

1228
01:22:02,118 --> 01:22:03,411
that I am going to run.

1229
01:22:04,452 --> 01:22:05,996
And you are going to help me.

1230
01:22:15,167 --> 01:22:16,168
What have we got here?

1231
01:22:17,169 --> 01:22:18,962
Bed roll, we've got some rope.

1232
01:22:20,337 --> 01:22:21,337
Tactical vest.

1233
01:22:21,630 --> 01:22:22,629
Okay, come on.

1234
01:22:25,132 --> 01:22:26,132
C-4.

1235
01:22:27,134 --> 01:22:28,426
One last time.

1236
01:22:28,509 --> 01:22:30,302
Who are the suppliers, the dealers,

1237
01:22:30,969 --> 01:22:33,012
and what are his drug trafficking routes?

1238
01:22:33,095 --> 01:22:34,930
Masovich's drug trade dies with him.

1239
01:22:35,014 --> 01:22:38,473
Well, okay. Then, you're gonna have to die
with him, too.

1240
01:22:41,684 --> 01:22:42,684
¡Mira!

1241
01:23:40,887 --> 01:23:42,679
You're not gonna talk.
Juan, shoot her.

1242
01:23:46,182 --> 01:23:47,557
Take your gun and shoot her.

1243
01:23:48,433 --> 01:23:49,476
Juan.

1244
01:23:51,143 --> 01:23:52,727
Sometime this week!

1245
01:23:53,311 --> 01:23:54,311
Juan.

1246
01:23:54,437 --> 01:23:55,437
This isn't like you.

1247
01:23:56,021 --> 01:23:59,648
A leader has to make hard choices,
and a soldier must follow orders.

1248
01:23:59,732 --> 01:24:01,608
Now, come on. No more wet blanket.

1249
01:24:01,691 --> 01:24:02,733
Be a man.

1250
01:24:04,443 --> 01:24:05,651
Be a man!

1251
01:24:07,445 --> 01:24:08,570
No, Juan.

1252
01:24:11,947 --> 01:24:12,946
Be your own man.

1253
01:24:20,286 --> 01:24:22,621
What are you doing here?
Saving your ass.

1254
01:24:23,412 --> 01:24:24,412
It's not a big thing.

1255
01:24:25,164 --> 01:24:27,707
Okay.

1256
01:24:41,673 --> 01:24:44,509
Ah... Never bring a knife to a gun...

1257
01:24:46,259 --> 01:24:48,844
You brought a knife to a gunfight!

1258
01:24:48,928 --> 01:24:49,928
Ah, ah, ah.

1259
01:24:50,763 --> 01:24:52,806
Ow!
Come on, come on, come on.

1260
01:24:57,058 --> 01:24:58,184
You follow me, she dies.

1261
01:25:01,977 --> 01:25:04,854
Dale.
Oye, mátalo.

1262
01:25:04,979 --> 01:25:06,231
Come on.

1263
01:25:09,899 --> 01:25:11,317
The Ghost can't save her,

1264
01:25:12,567 --> 01:25:13,567
but you can.

1265
01:25:25,575 --> 01:25:28,244
Get me to the capital.
I need to address my nation.

1266
01:25:29,412 --> 01:25:31,996
I am a forgiving man.
I'm gonna give you one last chance

1267
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,956
to tell me what I need to know.

1268
01:25:41,127 --> 01:25:42,585
Move.

1269
01:25:42,669 --> 01:25:43,711
Move.

1270
01:25:50,298 --> 01:25:51,466
McRib is back.

1271
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:53,175
Okay, okay. I surrender.

1272
01:25:53,259 --> 01:25:54,343
Really?
Yeah.

1273
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:07,393
Give me your hand.

1274
01:26:15,064 --> 01:26:16,982
Climb up.
I'm trying.

1275
01:26:40,371 --> 01:26:42,080
Ow!

1276
01:26:42,164 --> 01:26:43,165
Ow!

1277
01:26:47,083 --> 01:26:48,251
That was a big one.

1278
01:26:50,836 --> 01:26:53,045
Yeah. Here comes a bigger one.

1279
01:26:56,465 --> 01:26:57,464
No!

1280
01:27:11,932 --> 01:27:12,931
Watch out.

1281
01:27:35,821 --> 01:27:37,364
I knew you were the Ghost.

1282
01:27:41,033 --> 01:27:42,033
Oh!
Oh!

1283
01:27:49,371 --> 01:27:50,539
No good. We're going down.

1284
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:54,750
We've got to jump.
Are you insane?

1285
01:27:54,833 --> 01:27:56,876
Better to jump than to crash. Trust me.

1286
01:27:58,294 --> 01:28:00,378
We just have to wait for the right moment.

1287
01:28:02,004 --> 01:28:03,004
Now?

1288
01:28:08,467 --> 01:28:09,634
Now.

1289
01:28:29,562 --> 01:28:30,562
Thank you.

1290
01:28:32,648 --> 01:28:33,648
Call me the Ghost.

1291
01:28:34,273 --> 01:28:36,442
How about I break your finger
if you shush me again?

1292
01:28:36,526 --> 01:28:38,151
You popped my knuckle.

1293
01:28:38,235 --> 01:28:40,444
I'm never gonna call you the Ghost.

1294
01:28:42,529 --> 01:28:43,821
But how about Sam?

1295
01:28:45,364 --> 01:28:46,364
Sam works.

1296
01:28:48,574 --> 01:28:51,618
Or bacon bits.
Sam and bacon bits, that's it though.

1297
01:29:00,957 --> 01:29:04,251
Well, all three kings of Caracas are dead.

1298
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:08,253
I guess you are an assassin after all.

1299
01:29:09,462 --> 01:29:10,796
That wasn't exactly my plan.

1300
01:29:11,338 --> 01:29:12,673
And yet I have to thank you.

1301
01:29:12,755 --> 01:29:15,632
Eliminating El Toro set the stage
perfectly for my coup.

1302
01:29:15,715 --> 01:29:18,133
Now, all I have to do
is eliminate the final players.

1303
01:29:19,468 --> 01:29:21,469
Is there anybody
who doesn't wanna kill me?

1304
01:29:40,147 --> 01:29:41,146
Amos?

1305
01:29:41,690 --> 01:29:42,524
How...?

1306
01:29:42,607 --> 01:29:44,858
An old contact of mine
from the State Department

1307
01:29:44,942 --> 01:29:47,694
told me that you were having a hard time
down here, so...

1308
01:29:47,777 --> 01:29:50,404
You called in the favor
so the CIA would pull me out?

1309
01:29:51,988 --> 01:29:56,448
You were an analyst for the Mossad.
Maybe I changed some of the details.

1310
01:29:57,032 --> 01:29:59,534
The Venezuelan general was in '84.

1311
01:30:00,076 --> 01:30:02,661
And apparently, another one
was taken out this year.

1312
01:30:03,412 --> 01:30:05,246
You mean, you're the...?

1313
01:30:09,248 --> 01:30:11,584
Well, thanks. I owe you one.

1314
01:30:11,708 --> 01:30:13,167
I know you're good for it.

1315
01:30:16,961 --> 01:30:18,296
We did it.

1316
01:30:18,379 --> 01:30:19,796
No, you did it.

1317
01:30:20,338 --> 01:30:21,381
Actually, Amos...

1318
01:30:25,675 --> 01:30:27,509
Badass.

1319
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:29,759
Yeah.

1320
01:30:52,567 --> 01:30:55,693
¡El Presidente!

1321
01:30:57,902 --> 01:30:58,737
Something tells me

1322
01:30:58,820 --> 01:31:01,488
we're gonna have a hard time
controlling this guy.

1323
01:31:04,157 --> 01:31:05,533
God, I hate the Ghost.

1324
01:31:07,159 --> 01:31:08,534
I love the Ghost.

1325
01:31:08,743 --> 01:31:11,036
Liar, fraud, phony.

1326
01:31:11,119 --> 01:31:12,871
Names Sam Larson used to be called,

1327
01:31:12,954 --> 01:31:16,372
but now he's simply known
as a bestselling novelist.

1328
01:31:16,456 --> 01:31:18,124
Sam, welcome.
Hi, Katie.

1329
01:31:18,207 --> 01:31:19,625
Your new book, A Ghost in Colombia,

1330
01:31:19,708 --> 01:31:23,044
is already a best seller
in the fiction category.

1331
01:31:23,419 --> 01:31:28,339
But what I found fascinating
is so many things that happen in this book

1332
01:31:28,422 --> 01:31:32,132
draw a distinct parallel to recent events
in Venezuela.

1333
01:31:32,215 --> 01:31:34,967
In Venezuela, in Venezuela, in Venezuela.

1334
01:31:37,469 --> 01:31:39,887
Uh, what are you...?
What are you asking?

1335
01:31:39,970 --> 01:31:42,013
Is this book actually fiction?

1336
01:31:50,060 --> 01:31:51,686
Katie, I'm here to say that...

1337
01:31:54,395 --> 01:31:56,647
it is absolutely not true.
