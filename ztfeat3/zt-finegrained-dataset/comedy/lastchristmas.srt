1
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:14,530
Let me tell you a secret

2
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:18,075
Put it in your heart and keep it 

3
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,904
Something that I want you to know 

4
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,869
Do something for me 

5
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:27,202
Listen to my simple story 

6
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,913
And maybe we'll have something to show 

7
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,716
You tell me you're cold on the inside 

8
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,761
How can the outside world 

9
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:40,306
Be a place
That your heart can embrace? 

10
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:44,511
Be good to yourself
'Cause nobody else 

11
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:48,349
Has the power to make you happy 

12
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,934
How can I help you? 

13
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,020
Please let me try to 

14
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,945
I can heal the pain 

15
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,820
That you're feeling inside 

16
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,322
Whenever you want me 

17
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:04,372
Know that
I will be waiting for the day 

18
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,542
That you say you'll be mine 

19
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:25,222
You look like you need another.

20
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:28,100
What are you, psychic?
Look deep into my eyes.

21
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:32,605
Yeah. You're feeling very thirsty.

22
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,185
Oh, you are very good.

23
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,360
And...

24
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,361
Oh, yeah, this is your favorite song.
That was so psychic.

25
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,408
No, that was you playing it
four times in a row.

26
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:45,159
Well, love me, love George Michael.
We're kindred spirits.

27
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,615
How so?
We're both singers.

28
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,544
Uh, we're both famously misunderstood
and underappreciated in our time.

29
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,776
All that's gonna change, 'cause tomorrow
I've got a big audition for the West End.

30
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,757
And you, uh, came into town for it?

31
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,757
No, I, uh, moved out on my flatmate today.

32
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,714
So, what, you're gonna move back home?
Oh, kill me now.

33
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:06,392
Uh-oh. Family issues.
Yeah. Let me count the ways.

34
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:10,142
Uh, anger, shame, resentment,
embarrassment... And that's just my mum.

35
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,189
Do you want to hear about my sister?
No.

36
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,732
Okay, so what's your plan?

37
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,687
I'll figure it out, you know.
It'll be fine. Something will turn up.

38
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,813
Or someone.

39
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:20,950
Mm.

40
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,200
Morning, gorgeous.

41
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:28,286
This bed,
it's like sleeping on a pile of kittens.

42
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:33,996
If that thought's comfortable
and not completely horrifying.

43
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,750
I'm gonna dash down the street.

44
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:39,755
I need some ginger root, fresh beets,
for my famous breakfast power juice.

45
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:42,679
Cool.
And a cappuccino while you wait.

46
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:43,800
Wow.

47
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,973
And lashings of hot water
if you fancy a shower.

48
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,433
Bliss.
I'll be right back.

49
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:51,138
Ah...

50
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,476
Surprise!

51
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,934
Guess who got back
from the conference a day early.

52
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,393
God, I've missed you.

53
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,482
God, who are you?
I'm the... plumber.

54
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,636
The plumber?
Look, this isn't what it looks like.

55
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,277
I needed a bed for the night, and he...
Ed.

56
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,078
Ed was just so understanding.

57
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,872
I have gobs of issues, all right?

58
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,561
Accommodation,
because I've run out of options

59
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,396
because I've really messed up
for a number of reasons.

60
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,501
And he...
Ed.

61
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,079
Ed just seemed to get that.

62
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:17,793
Did you shag him?

63
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,592
Oh!

64
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,044
Look, you took my bag...

65
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:26,724
Ow!

66
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,469
Why is my life so shit?

67
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:35,398
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart 

68
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,771
But the very next day 

69
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,444
You gave it away 

70
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,649
This year, to save me from tears 

71
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:48,487
I'll give it to someone special 

72
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:53,492
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart 

73
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:57,295
But the very next day
You gave it away 

74
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,496
Oh...

75
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,630
This year, to save me from tears 

76
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:07,305
I'll give it to someone special 

77
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,493
It's not funny, Klaus.

78
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,491
It's incredible how unfunny it is.

79
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:39,041
Tell me, baby, do you recognize me? 

80
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,874
Well, it's been a year
It doesn't surprise me 

81
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:47,929
Happy Christmas
I wrapped it up and sent it 

82
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,395
Christ.

83
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,861
Oh, I'm sorry, George.

84
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:08,946
Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy.

85
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,004
Hey, you're early.

86
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,125
You are never early. What are you up to?

87
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,379
Accommodation issues.

88
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,802
Mm. So the usual.
What did you do this time?

89
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,597
Fry someone's fish?
No. No, that was last week.

90
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,517
You are going to run out
of friends with sofas.

91
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:45,524
You have been sick.
You need to take care of yourself better.

92
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,697
Santa, I didn't know you cared.
I don't care.

93
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,177
I just don't want you to drop dead
in front of the customers.

94
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,693
I don't have enough tinsel
to cover your corpse.

95
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,278
Get to work, Elf.

96
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,003
I don't know.
You're gonna have to help me decide.

97
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,422
They're both so darling.
I tell you what.

98
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,875
Let's pretend Mary had twins,
and you can get both.

99
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,009
You must just love your job.
Love it.

100
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,430
It's like being in a dream.

101
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,509
All the joys and the love of Christmas

102
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,266
every single day of the year.

103
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:23,521
Now, which baby is it going to be?
He's gorgeous, but this one...

104
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,339
He looks like he's having a lot of fun.
Oh, yeah, and a lot more to come.

105
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,656
But this one? Look at him.
He's more like my idea of...

106
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,108
Jesus Christ.
You think so too?

107
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,444
Katarina.
Excuse me for just one moment. Santa!

108
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,870
I need a word.
I'm at work. You could've called.

109
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,165
You're not answering your phone. Remember?

110
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,833
I've come from work.
I need to get back, so get out here.

111
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:45,463
That's my analyst. So sorry.
Santa, can you get down here, please?

112
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,540
Please? Thank you.

113
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,176
Santa?

114
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,590
Are you there?

115
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,593
Mum needs you to ring her.

116
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,886
Every time she contacts you
and gets no response, she contacts me.

117
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,063
Yesterday, 17 times. Just do it.

118
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,232
Oh, don't just stand there
issuing commands. I am an adult.

119
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,810
You are the furthest thing from an adult
that I know.

120
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,609
I need time to myself.

121
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,817
I'm asking you to do a single thing,
Katarina.

122
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,368
It's "Kate."
Whatever. Just ring her. Contact her.

123
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,661
Give me one good reason.

124
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,659
You've missed five doctor's appointments.

125
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,412
You've got one tomorrow, which you know.
You have to be there.

126
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,789
She's also planning a dinner
to celebrate my promotion.

127
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,213
And you not ringing her
is seriously affecting my life.

128
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,133
Will you be inviting Alba to the dinner?

129
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,128
Just ring your mother.

130
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,098
Christ.

131
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,977
Jenna, it's me. Listen, darling,
I'm sorry to leave this message.

132
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,100
I just really need a bed for the night.
Even possibly a few nights.

133
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,603
You're my bestie. Please. I know. Just...

134
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:50,437
Hey, Elf!
This is my elf. Santa has elves, you know.

135
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,146
Little helpers.

136
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,608
I have nicknamed her "Lazy the Elf"
because she appears never to work.

137
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,702
That's me.

138
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,620
She could also be called
"Crushing Disappointment the Elf."

139
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,727
I'm just...
"Waste of Payroll the Elf,"

140
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,960
"Bleeding Me Dry the Elf,"
"Why on Earth Is She Even Here the Elf."

141
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,445
What?
Jesus.

142
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,619
Where did you come from?
What are you looking at?

143
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,043
Look. There. You see it?

144
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,791
Ah.
Just above the lip of the roof there.

145
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,964
It's quite unusual
to see a bird like that in town.

146
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,882
Blimey.

147
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,719
Oh, damn it!
Here. I think it just pooed in your eye.

148
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,138
Yeah, I think so.

149
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,659
Good-bye, my people.
Sorry.

150
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,390
Ow.

151
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,580
Where have you been?
Oh. A shitting bird just shat in my eye.

152
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,391
Is there a bird in here?
No.

153
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,601
Some bloke was outside the shop
playing silly buggers.

154
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,186
Maybe you can focus your attention

155
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,338
on the silly buggers inside the shop.

156
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,228
Oh! My phone. Sorry. Sorry.

157
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,654
I'm sorry, Santa.

158
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,858
Yeah! Jenna? Yes!

159
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,764
Thank you so much. Thank you so much.
I'll be with you around 8:00. Okay.

160
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,724
Get off the phone, Elf!
Okay, I got to go. Bye.

161
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,866
I'm just gonna get the shit out my eye.
Time to sparkle!

162
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,624
Just hear those sleigh bells jinglin'
Ring-ting-tinglin' too 

163
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,421
There you are, sir.
Enjoy your festive hybrid Hanukkah bush.

164
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:36,216
Merry Christmas to you. Thank you.
Thank you. Take care.

165
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,760
She drives me crazy 

166
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,950
Your mother again?
I curse the day I was born.

167
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,011
Me too.
Ha. Funny, no.

168
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,621
I installed everything on her phone,
from Snapchat to Instagram.

169
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,804
It means I can disappoint her
in more ways than ever.

170
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,101
Mothers are hell.
Oh, yeah.

171
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,684
Mm. Hello.

172
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,735
Leave him to me.
Oh?

173
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,986
You'll just flirt with him,
and he'll forget to buy anything.

174
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,775
Hi.
How can I help you?

175
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,736
Wouldn't mind finding him in my stocking.

176
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,540
Hi.
Ah! Hi. Hi.

177
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,334
I came in to check on your eye.
It's fine.

178
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,458
It's good luck, you know.
What is?

179
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:14,959
Getting pooed on by a bird.

180
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,166
Bollocks is it.
No, seriously.

181
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,173
So I thought I'd see if you fancied
a little stroll with me.

182
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,425
Oh, that's my luck,
going for a stroll with you?

183
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,515
Might be.

184
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,592
Look, did you find me on Swiper?

185
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,846
Swiper?
Yeah.

186
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,956
The modern dating application
you might have heard of.

187
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,516
Oh. So not.

188
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,850
To be honest, you're not really my type.
To be honest, you're not really mine.

189
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,028
Well, maybe we should just leave it then.

190
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,946
I do like a challenge though.

191
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,899
You considered BASE jumping?

192
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,905
Japanese blowfish?
No, I have.

193
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,907
But right now
I'm considering a stroll with you.

194
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,614
Consider away, because it's a no.

195
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,792
Is there anything I could improve upon
to, say, persuade you?

196
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,494
No.
Any reason in particular?

197
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,399
Because you're weird,
this is weird, and I don't know you.

198
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,005
So, please, could you just leave, okay?

199
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,674
Shoo. Just go. Just go.
Hold on. This is weird.

200
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,969
Weirder than Grabber or Swiper
or whatever it's called?

201
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,091
Yeah.

202
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,513
Oh, just...

203
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:09,052
Weirder than total strangers
deciding on one Photoshopped image

204
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,558
whether or not to engage
in immediate foreplay?

205
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,139
I'm busy. You're weird. Good-bye.

206
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,486
Um...

207
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,450
Do you need any...

208
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,798
Good evening.
Good eve...

209
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,301
Can I help you?

210
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,004
I think so.

211
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,682
Go on then.

212
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,598
What is it you were looking for?

213
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,349
Uh...

214
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,024
this.

215
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,022
That is very nice.

216
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,399
It's Mr. Claus, I believe.

217
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,605
Yes.

218
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,281
Upon his vehicle.

219
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,403
Yes.

220
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,698
Do you have something dissimilar?

221
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:13,249
Yes. We have many dissimilar items.

222
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,629
For instance, this Christmas gibbon.

223
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,389
It is amusing.

224
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,271
I think so too.

225
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,815
I'll come back for it.

226
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,106
Yes.

227
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,825
Yes.

228
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,164
Yes.

229
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:04,212
Wow. That was like watching
a short Scandinavian film.

230
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,013
Are you all right?

231
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:13,225
Yes, I'm fine.
Wait. Hang on. Did you like him?

232
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,303
You're so mysterious, I can't tell.

233
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:19,640
Of course not.
Oh, my God, you did like him.

234
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,396
I don't know anything about him.

235
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,227
And you're fantasizing, Elf,

236
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:26,405
because all you seem to think about
these days is sex.

237
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,527
Ooh.

238
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,871
Oh, my God! He's coming back.
Where?

239
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,539
Got you. I knew you liked him.

240
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:40,586
Well, now I know. You like your men
tall, shy and translucent.

241
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,788
Like a squid,
but with bones and less legs.

242
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,874
Shut up, lock up, and good night.

243
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,174
Mm-hmm.

244
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,261
Oh, shit.

245
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,506
Arse, head and hole!

246
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,224
Piss off, Klaus!

247
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,901
Sorry! Late for an audition.

248
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,951
Sorry! Bugger!

249
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,072
No, no! Please wait! Please wait!
Please wait!

250
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,828
He was... He was very good.

251
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,705
Not for me.

252
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,832
Charming.
Jarring.

253
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,756
I would put him in "maybe plus."
"Maybe plus."

254
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,634
Hi.

255
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,801
Hi. Sorry.
Hi. Oh.

256
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,448
So sorry. I'm late.
Sorry.

257
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,088
The auditions are closed now.

258
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,344
I was on the list. My name's Kate Andrich.

259
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,235
There was a terrible accident
on the way here.

260
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,681
Was Santa involved?

261
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,137
She was, actually, yeah.

262
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:43,349
"She"? Oh, is this like
a "God being a woman now" thing?

263
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,935
Oh, no. These are my work clothes.
Don't worry about it.

264
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,735
Where do you work? Elf and Safety?

265
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:50,574
Not exactly.

266
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,775
Uh, I'm so sorry. You're gonna have to

267
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,531
come back next time.
It's too late.

268
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,159
You know what? Let her go. Who knows?
She might be the next Streisand.

269
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:01,663
We don't know. Plus, I've never seen
an elf audition before.

270
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:06,251
Um, yeah. Take it away,
you weird little North Pole-ian.

271
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,707
It's Kate. Where can I plug in my music?

272
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,463
The sound engineer's gone home.

273
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:14,137
Great.
A cappella. The penalty for lateness.

274
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,182
Yeah, I can do that. Okay. Sure.

275
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:19,436
Okay.

276
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:25,182
Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens 

277
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:28,235
Bright copper kettles
And warm woolen mittens 

278
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,530
Brown paper packages
Tied up with string 

279
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,233
These are a few of my favorite things 

280
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,740
Stop! Stop.
When the dog bites... 

281
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,907
You've got the part.
Don't I need to...

282
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,538
Oh, uh, sorry. No, no, no, it was...

283
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,244
It was shit.

284
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,174
Jingle bell, jingle bell
Jingle bell rock 

285
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,295
Whoa!

286
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,627
You. Again.
What do you mean, "again"?

287
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,304
Did you follow me here?
No, I made a delivery here.

288
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,007
Yeah?
Are elves always so cynical?

289
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,809
Yes, relentlessly. These are dark times.

290
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:05,765
So having not followed you here,
and having made my delivery,

291
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,145
and you having bumped into me by chance,

292
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,070
here we are.

293
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,062
"Here we are"?

294
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,337
Well, for instance,
we could go for a walk.

295
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,360
Why do you keep trying to
take me for a walk? I'm not a dog.

296
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,945
You are wearing a collar.
Oh, LOL. You know what?

297
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,032
I'm just not in the mood for a walk.
Why?

298
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,459
Well, fine. Okay.

299
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,252
I was just incredibly bad at what I do

300
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,250
in front of people
who could've given me a job.

301
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,751
I thought you had a job.

302
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,333
Yes, but it's not what I "do" do.
I'm not a career elf.

303
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,422
What do you do?

304
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,056
Sing.

305
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,052
Wow. That's pretty amazing.

306
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,885
I just can't seem to... at the moment.

307
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,221
Anyway, boring, boring, boring.
La, la, la.

308
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,646
I'm not bored.

309
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,816
Actually, who are you?
I'm Tom.

310
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:52,362
Kate.

311
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,722
Why are you so flexible?
Why are you dressed like an elf?

312
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,615
You know why. And you know what?

313
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:02,496
I have had my fill of utterly hilarious
elf jokes for one night.

314
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,868
Cover me.

315
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,417
Here?
Here.

316
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,458
You are now my cupboard door.

317
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,549
Do you do this often?
Only when I have to.

318
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,964
Oh, piss off. Nice covering.
I'm trying my best here.

319
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,887
Okay. Oh, no. Hang on.

320
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:31,020
Where are we going?
This way. Come on.

321
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,155
Oh...

322
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,365
Look at that.

323
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,613
You never seen this alleyway before?
Nope.

324
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,865
This is the narrowest alley in London.

325
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,914
My mate Hendo calls it
"Fat Man's Squeeze."

326
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,834
It's pretty cool, though, isn't it?
Sure. Why not?

327
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,330
I like hidden places.

328
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:54,290
Has anyone ever told you there's something
slightly serial killer-y about you?

329
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,047
No. Come to think of it,
no one's ever said that to me before.

330
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,254
Ah.
Never more than once, anyway.

331
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,976
Why are you always dancing about?
Look up.

332
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,564
Oh, wow.

333
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,062
Are they mice?
Yeah, I think so.

334
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,319
There must be a story attached to them.
I'll have to find out one day.

335
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,522
Yeah. I mean, it's very...
Come on.

336
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,946
You are so strange.

337
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,278
You're so weird!
Keep looking up.

338
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,059
Oh. Ow!

339
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,120
You okay?
No!

340
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,544
Just my luck.
I face-plant into a pile of rubbish

341
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,589
because I wasn't looking where
I was going like a bloody normal person.

342
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,634
You're not used to looking up.
Or smelling like a bin.

343
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,711
Have you seen this?
Seen what?

344
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,805
Oh, my God!
Yeah.

345
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,850
I've walked down this street many times.
I've never seen that before.

346
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,928
Like I say, follow me.

347
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,040
This is cool.

348
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,172
Welcome to my secret little garden.

349
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,546
I had no idea this existed.

350
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,127
Not many people do.

351
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,639
Oh.

352
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,932
Ooh. Have a look over there.

353
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,599
It's Gideon.
Yes.

354
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,302
He's recently divorced.
Oh.

355
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,729
He owes £748 in child support.

356
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,106
How do you know?

357
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,105
I heard him have a very loud
phone conversation behind that shrub.

358
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,687
He probably thought
no one could hear him.

359
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:44,240
Oh, and that's Geoff, a Mafia don.
Really?

360
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,238
No. He works at Burger King.

361
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,820
He's also a vegan, so very conflicted.

362
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,539
Who's she?

363
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,660
That's Ursula.
She lives in the flats round the back.

364
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,167
She runs a brothel down in Bethnal Green.

365
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,044
Some of the girls used to come,
take a seat,

366
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,797
have a chat, and then go back to work.

367
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,466
Do you think
she was giving them tips?

368
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,173
No. More like a bit of support.

369
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,686
I want to talk to her.
No, you can't do that. No, no.

370
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,348
Everyone keeps everyone's secrets here.
It's like an unspoken rule.

371
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,104
You just told me Gideon's.

372
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,727
Fair point.

373
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,358
You're one of us now.

374
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,739
So when's your next audition?

375
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,792
Saturday. It's for Frozen.
What's that?

376
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,370
You... You really don't know?

377
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:39,671
No, really.
Okay.

378
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:44,218
It's a film about two sisters who used
to get on really well, and then don't,

379
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:48,388
because one of them
has a problem with ice.

380
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,761
And the production is on ice!

381
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,264
Huh. So you can skate as well as sing?

382
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,266
No.
You can't skate?

383
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:58,690
Never tried it.
I'm gonna wing it. It'll be cool.

384
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:01,439
I really enjoyed our walk today.
Ditto.

385
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:04,988
Would you like to repeat the experience?

386
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:08,067
Would you like to give me your number?
I don't have a phone.

387
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:14,164
I was just beginning to think
you're not as weird as you look.

388
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,243
Before you throw me in the bin
with the rest of your battered conquests,

389
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,749
it's not completely true...
I do have a phone.

390
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,081
It's just locked in a cupboard.
Why?

391
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,339
I got so tired of staring
at my hand all day. You should try it.

392
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:29,199
That's like saying you should try death.

393
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:32,842
Somebody really wants to get hold of you.
Someone really isn't gonna get a chance.

394
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,598
No.

395
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:38,772
Ditch that.
All of your stresses will just melt away.

396
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,566
Oh, but I just like stress.

397
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,518
Oi. You getting on?

398
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,979
Yeah.
Your chariot awaits.

399
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,565
Indeed.

400
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,867
I'll see you at the store.
Okay.

401
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:54,196
And don't forget... look up.
Oh, for God's sake, shut up, will you?

402
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,519
Hi.
Hi. Thank you so much.

403
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,275
Thank you so much.
It's okay.

404
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:32,075
And your suite, madame. Ta-da!

405
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,950
You called just before we got the crib up,
so there was still room.

406
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,750
Yeah. This is gonna be so good
for my sex life.

407
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:51,471
Hey, Ruf.
Hey, Kate.

408
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:52,796
Thanks for this.
Holding up?

409
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,428
Oh, yeah. Yeah, fine. Totally fine.
How's it all been?

410
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,512
Reentry and all that. How's Santa?
Oh, you know, fine.

411
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,933
Her usual curt, Asian self.

412
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,892
I thought you might have
decided to move on.

413
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,352
No, no.

414
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,090
With something that started
as a Saturday job?

415
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,401
Yeah. Comfy where I am.

416
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:15,319
And what about your folks and Mad Marta,

417
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,654
with her law firm and her briefcase?
Oh.

418
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:22,038
I stay out of contact with the crazies,
just to give myself a bit of space.

419
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:26,041
Are the doctors keeping in touch?
How about being pregnant? Huh?

420
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,169
For crying out loud, how's that?
It's a total conspiracy, is what it is.

421
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,626
Yeah?
They lie to you about pregnancy.

422
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,463
You know the whole glowing,
mother-to-be image you see in the ads?

423
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:37,048
It's just bollocks. Genuine bollocks.

424
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,555
It's just a nine-month-long trauma

425
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,289
spent piddling into cups...
Of course it is.

426
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,147
...being poked up the vag
by strangers with cold hands,

427
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:47,772
and if men had to do this shit,
we would have contraceptive beer.

428
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,147
Actually, if men had to do it,

429
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,400
the human race would just die out.
Shh.

430
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:55,234
No, Ruf. I know you know all this,
and I know you're fed up with feminism...

431
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,866
I'm not fed up with feminism.
No, I mean she's not listening.

432
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,122
That's not right.

433
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:10,461
This is a fish knife. I'm trying to cut
a passion fruit with a fish knife.

434
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:14,090
If anyone can do it, you can.
It's your fault. You did this.

435
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,922
Wake me up before you go-go 

436
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,508
Don't leave me hangin' on like a yo-yo 

437
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,601
Wake me up 

438
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,229
Well, hey, Sleeping Beauty.

439
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,398
Hi.
Come and grab some food.

440
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,484
Oh, yeah.

441
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,936
Oh! Good sleeping.

442
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,865
Anyone up for a, you know, pizza?
Bottle of Rioja?

443
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,691
Mm. Celiac.

444
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,651
Oh, yeah. I forgot.
And preggers.

445
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:41,238
So we ain't drinking either, party girl.

446
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:44,540
Okay. Well, I'm off out.

447
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,835
Okay. I'll see you later.
I won't be too late. I promise.

448
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,129
Yeah, all right. Peace out.

449
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,593
Don't. She's my oldest friend.

450
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,241
I know it seems like she's...
The most selfish woman in the world?

451
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,928
Oof. Harsh. She's been ill.

452
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:04,978
I'm over the galleon, but one more thing,
and my legendary patience will crumble.

453
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,021
Don't bring that up.
She burned her eyebrows off.

454
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,520
Her eyebrows will grow back.
You know what won't grow back?

455
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,687
Oh, my...
My matchstick galleon.

456
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:15,568
No, I agree. One, and she's out.

457
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:19,776
Wakey, wakey, London.
Here's something to start your day.

458
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:34,041
No! Not again! Stop. Shh.

459
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:38,573
You take me for full English now?
No. You had the full English last night.

460
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:42,845
Hi.

461
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,722
Morning. Hello.

462
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:47,555
Happy? A good morning.
It's brilliant. It's lovely, isn't it?

463
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:49,560
Wow. Someone looks not rested.

464
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,516
What? Me? No, fine. Totally fine.

465
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:56,321
Able to leap sofas in a single bound...
Oh, my God! No, no, no!

466
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:24,766
Just gonna write this out for you.
They've had a right go, haven't they?

467
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:27,265
Probably just kids.
Yeah, I reckon it's just kids.

468
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:30,688
I just said. This is your crime number.
You'll need it for insurance.

469
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,982
What happened?
Break-in, I'm afraid.

470
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,809
Very common this time of year.

471
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,361
Place like this is a prime target.
Lovely, it is.

472
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,523
Is that a crocodile with pom-poms?

473
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:44,194
Yes.
And, uh, who's this?

474
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:45,574
This is my employee.

475
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:49,032
She locked up last night,
so please ask her if she saw anything.

476
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,286
Nothing out of the ordinary.

477
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,192
Are you writing that down?
How do you spell "ordinary"?

478
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,754
Well, we're done here.
We'll be in touch if we hear anything.

479
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:02,337
Mm, pity. It's a lovely place.
It is. I love Christmas.

480
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:03,763
No, you don't.

481
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,035
You make "have a merry Christmas"
sound like a death threat.

482
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,516
What are you talking about?

483
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:10,471
Merry Christmas.
Have yourself a merry Christmas, yeah?

484
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,647
You see? You just did it.
What do you mean?

485
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:13,849
Let me get my phone out.

486
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,212
I'll record you, and you'll realize
you sound like Jason Statham.

487
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,131
That's a good thing,
'cause I love Jason Statham,

488
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:19,591
so that's not an insult.
Santa, I...

489
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,322
Don't talk to me.
But, listen, I...

490
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:24,617
I said, "Don't talk to me."
You forgot to lock up.

491
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,239
Don't deny it.

492
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,866
I can pay you back.

493
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,789
Now, you listen to me,
and you listen good.

494
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,541
You were great at your job
when you started.

495
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,874
That's why I took you on full-time.

496
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:43,507
You've got a way with people,
and I felt so lucky to have you.

497
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:47,049
Thanks.
But I don't feel lucky anymore.

498
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:50,726
Since you came back,
you started losing your shit.

499
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,099
It's like you don't care about anything.

500
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:57,775
So now, you care about this.

501
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:02,238
I had to smash my own window
to make it look like a break-in.

502
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,987
Otherwise I wouldn't get the insurance.

503
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:08,912
You turned me into someone
who broke the law.

504
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:17,375
I can't believe I'm even giving you
another chance, but I am, because...

505
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,422
I am a good person.
Yeah.

506
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,673
But one more thing, and you're out.

507
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:29,716
So clean up your mess,
you stupid, stupid girl.

508
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,772
Joy to the world 

509
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,354
The Lord is come 

510
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:47,533
Let Earth receive her king 

511
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,111
Let every heart 

512
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,322
Prepare him room 

513
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:57,752
And heaven and nature sing 

514
00:29:57,838 --> 00:30:00,296
And heaven, and heaven 

515
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:02,624
And nature sing 

516
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,889
Hey.

517
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,474
Were you coming to see me?

518
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,598
No.
Oh.

519
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,184
Great.
You okay?

520
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:18,856
Yeah. No, we had a break-in,

521
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,979
and Santa's taken it really badly.
Right.

522
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:24,340
And I got chucked out of my digs
this morning, so I've got nowhere to stay.

523
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,026
Hmm.
Anyway, I'm homeless again.

524
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:27,482
That bad, huh?

525
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:28,783
Yep.

526
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:29,950
Okay.

527
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,058
You should come with me then.
You were so coming to see me.

528
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,744
Mm-mmm.
Yep.

529
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,915
Nope.
Yep.

530
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,459
Not in your wildest dreams.

531
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,831
Uh, yeah.
This way.

532
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,504
Yeah, you were coming to see me.
Uh-uh.

533
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,292
Here we are.

534
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:49,637
What is this?
Your people. The homeless.

535
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,806
Oh, Christ.

536
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,599
Well, thanks, Bono

537
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,803
or Mother Teresa or whoever wins
the moral superiority prize.

538
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,763
You're the one
who used the word "homeless."

539
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,270
I meant I haven't got a place
to stay that I've chosen.

540
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,046
I choose not to go back
to my parents' house.

541
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:06,188
And they live here in London?
Yeah, kind of, sort of.

542
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,926
Christ, if I'm going home,
I'm gonna need a drink.

543
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,738
How about you leave it,
and you go home alarmingly sober?

544
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,616
Bugger off,
person who has never met my parents.

545
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,787
Okay.

546
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,165
Where are you going?

547
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,331
I'm going in there.
Well, you're not homeless?

548
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,707
No, I volunteer in here.

549
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:28,380
Christ, why don't you just get "saint"
tattooed on your forehead?

550
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,087
Oh, boy. Just can't help it, can you?

551
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:32,676
Help what?

552
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,512
Never mind. Good luck.

553
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,435
Oh.
Good night.

554
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,561
Somebody told me 

555
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,481
Boy, everything she wants 

556
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,531
Is everything she sees 

557
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:55,195
I guess I must have loved you 

558
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:59,328
Because I said you were
The perfect girl for me 

559
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,418
Baby 

560
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:03,085
And now we're six months older 

561
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:06,088
And everything you want 

562
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,917
And everything you see 
Hi. Yeah, I need a cab.

563
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,878
Is out of reach, not good enough 

564
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:16,474
I don't know
What the hell you want from me, oh 

565
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,433
I honestly think she preferred it
when I was ill.

566
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:24,857
You know? Like it made her
more important, more center-stage.

567
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:28,562
And all she's done, really,
since the operation,

568
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:32,069
is try to interfere and control my life.

569
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,759
How do you even know if you have a life?

570
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:35,555
Does anything official arrive
that tells you?

571
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,946
Like an envelope that's like,
"Dear so-and-so.

572
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,247
You now have a life.
We wish you'd get on with it."

573
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:43,167
Hmm.
Oh, everything's just such a mess.

574
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:44,994
How did I even get here?

575
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,829
Through the tunnel.

576
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,334
Yeah.

577
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,209
Here we are.

578
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,670
Mm. Thanks, Dad.

579
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,722
You coming in?

580
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,845
No, no, no. Your mother is still up.

581
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,767
I like to wait until she's asleep.

582
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:02,766
She talks less.

583
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:09,436
Why don't you just get a divorce, huh?
Been avoiding each other for years.

584
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,488
Ah. No, divorce is for the rich.

585
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:13,815
Ah.

586
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,905
Get some rest, Katarina. You look done in.

587
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,236
It's "Kate."

588
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,330
Ah.

589
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,452
Don't pick up anyone dodgy.

590
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,408
Yeah.

591
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:25,710
Love you.

592
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,011
Oh.

593
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,769
Mum?

594
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,898
Mum, would you let me in?

595
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,189
Mum? Would... Mum!

596
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,947
Nailed it shut. Mental.

597
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:03,326
KGB! Open up! KGB!

598
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,085
Stop. Stop. You are very bad girl.

599
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,955
Would you prefer the KGB?
KGB...

600
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,292
You don't make joke about
what you don't understand.

601
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,613
Yeah, well, can I just come in?

602
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:17,799
What you done? You look like dead person.

603
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,630
Oh, yeah. Thanks. Great parenting. Great.

604
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,933
Why don't you ring me? You have phone.
It's broken.

605
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:28,390
Why you say that? Why you not ring me
when I worry about you?

606
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:30,850
Not to hear nothing.

607
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:36,440
No call, no Twitter, no Snapchat shot.

608
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:38,570
I think, "She's dead, she's had lapse,

609
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:42,199
she's never coming home,
like her father who is never here."

610
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:47,159
My life is hell, Katarina.
It's "Kate." It's "Kate."

611
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:51,246
"Kate" is not a name. "Katarina" is name.

612
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:56,175
Katarina. Cat is animal. Cat, dog.

613
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:59,254
What I call Marta? Dog.
I call you cat. Meow.

614
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,010
Yeah, no, great, but can I get some sleep?

615
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,308
One of us should sleep.

616
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:05,851
I don't sleep.

617
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,599
This is very...

618
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:09,601
This is naughty.
Yeah.

619
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:14,231
Mum! Can I please just go to sleep?
Yes, you sleep. We talk morning.

620
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:16,233
You are clean, hmm?
Yeah, yeah.

621
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:18,280
Pillow. Pillow.
Okay. Yeah, it's a pillow.

622
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,107
Head. Sleep.
Yeah, I'm gonna...

623
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:22,652
Mm.
Yeah, okay.

624
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,247
Okay. Good night.
Naughty.

625
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:33,750
Oh, God.

626
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,364
So, tell me about the diet.
Keeping up with the fruit and veg?

627
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:05,454
Yeah, fine.

628
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,780
She's eating rubbish when she is outside.

629
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,787
When she's at home,
she's eating my food, and it's good.

630
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,960
I'm sure it is. What about sleep?

631
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:14,357
It's all right.
She never sleeps.

632
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:15,381
Exercise?

633
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:16,626
Religiously.
Not at all.

634
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,207
Alcohol?
Every once in a while.

635
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,133
Oh, she's drinking like the pirate.

636
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,572
You say you're okay.
Yep.

637
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,636
And your mother says the opposite.
Who do I believe?

638
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,589
Me, obviously.
Me, the mother, of course.

639
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,802
All right, all right, listen.
There's nothing conclusive here,

640
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:31,729
but you, Kate,
you've got to take care of your heart.

641
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:35,559
You need to rest more,
eat better, drink less,

642
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,188
and stop being so angry.

643
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,278
Da.

644
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:41,356
And you, Mrs. Andrich,
you need to worry less.

645
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:45,363
I not sleeping. Can you please
give me something for sleeping?

646
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,740
Mrs. Andrich, you've been given
everything there is

647
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:50,073
for sleep, anxiety, panic attacks,
the lot.

648
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,144
You have the best that
modern medicine has to offer.

649
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:56,333
Then what can I do?
Join a club. Hmm? Talk to other people.

650
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:57,834
Enjoy time with your friends.

651
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:01,126
All my friends were murdered.
Okay, fine.

652
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,586
Thank you so much for your time.
Let's go, Mum. Come on.

653
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,888
Come on. I know. Out we get.
Thank you.

654
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:07,743
Sorry. Let's go.
We'll see you in a month.

655
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:12,748
Thank you!

656
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:13,772
Bloody hell.

657
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,242
Can I help?

658
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,698
No.

659
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,533
I'm having a self-pity party.

660
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,584
Ooh. Am I invited?

661
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,130
Only if you promise to judge me.

662
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,458
Oh, you definitely don't need
any help doing that.

663
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:44,005
Or maybe you do.

664
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,420
I'm very good at tidying up.

665
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,304
Yes.

666
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:10,365
These expensive?

667
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:11,491
Just...

668
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,332
Idiot. Follow me.

669
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,953
Ah. Ta-da.

670
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,420
All right, Mr. Muscle,
you can get to refreshing that tree.

671
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,510
This one?
Yeah.

672
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,630
Going home always makes me crazy.

673
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,927
How was it?
Hell. Mum sung me to sleep.

674
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,224
You're the only person who can make being
sung to sleep sound like waterboarding.

675
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,559
Well, it's not that dissimilar.

676
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,862
These, um, folk songs
make you want to string yourself up.

677
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,573
Is that where you get your singing from?

678
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,447
Yeah, she was a singer
back in the homeland.

679
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,244
Where was that?
Former Yugoslavia.

680
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:53,914
We had to escape.

681
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,830
Because of the war?
Exactly.

682
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:58,788
Mm. Must have been hard.

683
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,291
Yeah. Dad was a lawyer.

684
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:04,545
Um, and now he stays away from home
as much as he can

685
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:06,341
because he'd rather be dead.

686
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:10,216
Except he's a minicab driver,
which is sort of the same thing.

687
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,301
Can he not practice here?

688
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:16,432
No, he couldn't afford to retrain,
so he's out all the time.

689
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:19,264
Also to avoid my mother,
who's given to depression

690
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,690
in much the same way as, um...

691
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,233
What?

692
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:26,319
You're looking at me like some sort of
science experiment that's gone wrong.

693
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,447
Sorry. No, I'm interested.

694
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:29,533
Hmm.

695
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,405
Your mother... when was the last time
you saw her not being depressed?

696
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:36,997
Ooh, I think when I got really ill.

697
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,665
And she was happy about that?

698
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:42,961
No, but she was happy about the attention.

699
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,757
I mean, I got a lot of attention,
but I was unconscious.

700
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,668
She got more.

701
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:51,549
The doctors, the nurses,
the hospital staff.

702
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,839
Drama. God, she loved it.

703
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:58,310
She sort of flowered under it,
like a late blossoming or something.

704
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,514
Anyway, when I got better,
it all went away,

705
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:03,600
and she's just never been the same since.

706
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:05,685
Maybe she enjoyed being needed again.

707
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,020
Oh, trust you to come up
with something understanding.

708
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:12,783
That is truly horrific.
I mean, who buys this stuff?

709
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:14,110
Santa.

710
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:18,994
She's Chinese, so she's got access
to some really freaky outlets.

711
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,368
She just loves Christmas
more than anything else.

712
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,625
More than taste or sanity.
Yes, exactly.

713
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:28,674
And that isn't even
the nastiest thing we sell.

714
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,298
Inconceivable.
Hang on.

715
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,636
Dun, dun, dah!
Oh!

716
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:38,388
Check it out.
What is it?

717
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,811
Is that donkey actually smiling at me?
Yeah. Yeah.

718
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,139
And that baby has a full set of teeth.
Oof.

719
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,565
I sold four of these last week.
I'm that good.

720
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:49,111
Oh, it's a techno manger.

721
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,905
Yeah. It's a disco nativity scene.

722
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,857
Is that really a good nutritional choice?

723
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,318
Oh, God, don't you start.

724
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:58,571
Where are you?
Look up.

725
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,209
Yeah.

726
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,626
After what you've been through,

727
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,500
shouldn't you be eating quinoa or kale
or something?

728
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,628
Yeah, but this admittedly rank burger

729
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:13,301
is all part of my grand plan
to become a famous singer

730
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:15,004
and die like Kurt Cobain,

731
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:17,431
Amy Winehouse and all the rest
at the age of 27.

732
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,634
How old are you?
45.

733
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,139
Oh. Good to have dreams.

734
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,346
Not really. I'm 26.

735
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,896
Oh, thank God. You still have time.

736
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,604
Come on. Get rid of that.

737
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:30,561
Let's go. I've got a surprise for you.

738
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:36,575
Ugh. Really?
Mm! Yummy!

739
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,996
There's something wrong with me.
I'm too trusting.

740
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:43,199
Down a dark alley again
with a complete stranger.

741
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:47,002
I don't even... I mean, seriously...

742
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,706
All right then.
Need a hand?

743
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,087
No.

744
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,169
Oh.

745
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:56,573
Oh, my God.
That looked painful.

746
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,304
Yeah. I'm fine!

747
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:00,303
You're fine.
That was like poetry in motion.

748
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:01,393
Piss off.
Come on.

749
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:04,060
Sure. I never wanted kids anyway.

750
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:08,899
Okay. Now I am intrigued.

751
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:11,147
How are you gonna dispose of my body?
Shh!

752
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,479
I am shushing.

753
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,011
Stay back.

754
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:19,277
Are you seriously doing
a James Bond impression?

755
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,703
Now is not the time for unpleasantness.

756
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:24,998
Now is the time for romance!

757
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,004
You like?

758
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,594
I like, yeah.

759
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:40,131
Let's go.

760
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:44,681
These are the days of the open hand 

761
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,268
They will not be the last 

762
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:51,058
Look around now 

763
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:56,113
These are the days
Of the beggars and the choosers 

764
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:59,738
This is the year of the hungry man 

765
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:03,533
Whose place is in the past 

766
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,956
Hand in hand 

767
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:11,538
With ignorance
And legitimate excuses 

768
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:15,420
The rich declare themselves poor 

769
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:18,924
And most of us are not sure 

770
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,379
If we have too much 

771
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:22,886
But we'll take our chances 

772
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:26,139
'Cause God's stopped keeping score 

773
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:29,973
I guess somewhere along the way 

774
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:34,606
He must have let us all out to play 

775
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,027
Turned his back 

776
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,652
And all God's children 

777
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:41,529
Crept out the back door 

778
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:47,706
Well, maybe we should all be
Praying for time 

779
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:49,584
Oi!

780
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:50,669
Oh, sorry!
Oh, crap.

781
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:51,960
You can't be in here!

782
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,046
Yeah, no.
Sorry, no.

783
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:55,373
We're leaving.
Absolutely, we're leaving.

784
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,178
Ow!
I'm coming. I'm com...

785
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:08,143
I would...
I call that a successful date.

786
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:11,722
Fun, free, illegal, romantic.

787
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:13,478
And practical too. Don't forget.

788
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:14,729
Why practical?

789
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,230
Your audition.

790
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,902
Remember?
Yes.

791
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:20,572
I'd like to think that I played a part
in your rise to stardom.

792
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,446
Remember me when you're at the top.

793
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:25,323
No chance. Tom who?

794
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:27,408
Actually, Tom who?

795
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,083
Webster.

796
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:33,498
Ah. You look like a Webster.

797
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:37,373
Now what?

798
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,417
Now I've got to go to work.

799
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,383
Um...

800
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,964
You knew.

801
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,970
I work nights.
Yes.

802
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,102
I knew.

803
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:53,556
It's night. Cool. Okay.

804
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,185
How you gonna get home?

805
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:56,767
Oh, the bus.

806
00:44:58,154 --> 00:44:59,565
You gonna be okay?

807
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,902
As okay as I'll ever be on the bus.

808
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:05,905
Okay, then.
I'll come find you at the shop.

809
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:10,410
I'm not sure if I've still got a job.
Santa kind of hates me.

810
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,707
Maybe you should do
something nice for Santa.

811
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,539
Good luck.

812
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,712
Look up.

813
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:29,717
Christ.

814
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:35,101
So this is our selection of nutcrackers.
Working hard over here.

815
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:37,478
Mm.
You know, from the ballet?

816
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,729
Tchaikovsky?
Ah!

817
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:41,903
Which kind of music is this?
I want something...

818
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,902
This is Christmas music.
You must enjoy it.

819
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:55,288
This is a big nutcracker.
Can my nuts fit inside there?

820
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:56,939
It depends
on how big are your nuts.

821
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:59,043
But it's too big.
We can't take that with us.

822
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,924
Santa, um,
I think I can take over from there.

823
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,171
Because, um, there's also someone here,

824
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:06,970
a gentleman who requires
your specific assistance.

825
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:09,514
Yes, you can have a look.
Think about it.

826
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,913
I'm gonna show you to the even
bigger nutcrackers around the corner.

827
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:14,053
There's bigger nuts?

828
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:16,183
For your big nuts. Here we are.

829
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,942
Have you come back for the gibbon?

830
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:25,234
Of all the things in my life,

831
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:28,488
this is my best thing.

832
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:30,954
What is?

833
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:33,038
Christmas.

834
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:36,084
Really?

835
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,034
This is why I love to come in here.

836
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:42,464
I also love it.
That is why I have this shop.

837
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,250
Oh, wow.

838
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:51,886
Have a holly jolly Christmas 

839
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:54,059
And in case you didn't hear 

840
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:59,940
Oh, by golly
Have a holly jolly Christmas 

841
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:01,437
This year 

842
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,570
Kate, that was lovely. Thank you.

843
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,023
Wonderful. I can smell the commitment.

844
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:10,887
Do you know we have people turn up here,
never been on an ice rink before?

845
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,119
I just couldn't imagine.

846
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:16,369
Do you know we had a woman
turn up in a crop top?

847
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:18,099
In a crop top to audition.
I remember.

848
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:19,789
Do you remember her flip-flops?

849
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:22,245
Thank you. We'll be in touch.

850
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,377
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

851
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:27,005
I think she'd be good for the horse.
Do you think so?

852
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,094
Oh, no!

853
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:30,886
Are you all right?

854
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:34,512
I, uh, I did that just in case
you thought I was too perfect.

855
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:36,802
Okay.

856
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,061
Okay.

857
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:40,855
Thank goodness
for a heavy woolen tight.

858
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,102
Idiot.

859
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:44,855
Skaters fall. It's fine.

860
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,663
So it went well, and I am happy.

861
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:04,917
Good.

862
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:07,715
All set for your date? Good Lord.

863
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:13,881
Okay. Right, um...
What?

864
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,886
We're just gonna need to dial this down.

865
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,262
I'm making an effort.

866
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:20,805
He's gonna think he's wandered
into the llama enclosure. Close.

867
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:24,391
Ow.
Mm-hmm.

868
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:27,273
Ow.
Yeah.

869
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:29,776
Serves you right.
So I defer to the Swiper queen.

870
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,232
Blot.
Mm.

871
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,738
There we are.

872
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:38,531
So, where is See-Through taking you?

873
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,707
I have no idea.
What's his name?

874
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:44,082
I can't pronounce it.
Lots of glottal stops.

875
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:49,291
Oh, when I try to say it,
I sound like a cat with a fur ball.

876
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:52,177
So I've decided to call him Boy.

877
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,755
Hmm. Well, at least your name's
easier to pronounce.

878
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:56,761
What? Huang Qing Shin?

879
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,177
You're not really called Santa?

880
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,313
Of course not, idiot.
I chose it for the shop.

881
00:49:03,399 --> 00:49:04,765
Really?

882
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:07,602
When I worked at the pet shop,
I called myself Kitty.

883
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:09,152
No.
Mm-hmm.

884
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:13,448
And at the health food shop, I was Miso.

885
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:15,526
No, no.
Mm-hmm. Yes, yes.

886
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:18,157
Guess what it was in the bakery
on the Edgware Road.

887
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:21,331
Uh... Crumpet? Sausage Roll?
Muffin.

888
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:23,659
Muffin?
"Muff" for short.

889
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,836
Excellent.
More important is, how do I look?

890
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:29,299
Really hot.

891
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:34,545
Did you just giggle like a girl?
I am a girl.

892
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,630
Not really.
Oh, shut up.

893
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:38,636
And where's this man of yours?

894
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:42,060
The one you keep looking out
the window for instead of working.

895
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,896
I don't know. He hasn't got a phone.

896
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,019
Oh. He's wise.

897
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:49,897
What is he doing with you?
Nothing.

898
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:51,321
Hmm.

899
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:55,528
Don't worry, Elf. He'll turn up.

900
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:44,827
Hi. Excuse me. I'm looking for someone.

901
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:46,453
Who's that then?
Uh, Tom.

902
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:48,126
Ah, ah, ah.

903
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:51,205
Would you like a biscuit, Arthur?
Have you got a bourbon, Danny boy?

904
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:54,166
No, but can I press you
to a custard cream?

905
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,298
Ooh. I wish somebody would.
Tom, did you say?

906
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:58,845
Yeah, Tom. Um, he's tall...

907
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:01,264
Tom!

908
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:02,886
Take your pick, young lady.

909
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:07,353
Right. Yeah, see, the thing is,
he's not homeless.

910
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:09,180
What's he doing here then?

911
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:12,313
Um, well, he works here. Nights, I think.

912
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:14,986
Ah, I don't see the night lot, me.
He must be a volunteer.

913
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,359
Yes. That's...
Oi, Danny! Give us a hand?

914
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:20,032
Speaking of which,
be a pet and serve the teas

915
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:21,906
while I get the soup sorted.

916
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:25,080
And only two biscuits each, mind.
I'm not made of bloody biscuits.

917
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,908
And watch this one,
'cause last week he filled his pockets.

918
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,618
Come on then! Tea's up!

919
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:34,669
I'm Tom. Ex-grenadier.
Lovely. Um...

920
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:35,758
Will I do?

921
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:38,586
Do you know, actually,
it's a whole different Tom.

922
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:42,172
But would you like a biscuit?
I could make some tea.

923
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,010
Just the two then?
Just...

924
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:53,892
Anyone like a cup of tea?

925
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,853
Try and keep it down to ten. Oi, oi.

926
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:00,774
Nice of you to volunteer.
I didn't. I was press-ganged.

927
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:04,323
You want to help us with the soup?
No. Thank you, but no.

928
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:06,996
If Tom Webster does come in,
could you just tell him

929
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,948
that Kate needs to talk to him?

930
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:10,784
Not "needs."
"Would like"?

931
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,961
Yeah. Yeah.

932
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:16,210
Got it.
Yeah, 'cause he doesn't have a phone.

933
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:20,169
Would you like soup? You've earned it.
No, I'm good. Thanks.

934
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,762
Dan, what do you reckon?

935
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,678
Bit up herself, I thought.

936
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:32,560
And she's very happy.

937
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,733
I show you picture.
You showed me, Mum.

938
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,980
A little beautiful picture.

939
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:39,609
Hey.
Oh! Oh, at last!

940
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:41,485
There she is.
Hey, at last.

941
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:44,443
I was so worried. Where you are, huh?

942
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,949
I was volunteering
at a homeless shelter.

943
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:49,076
What it mean?
It means helping, Mum.

944
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,532
You? Helping?
Yes.

945
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:54,085
Sure, you were. And I
just rescued an orphan from a burning car.

946
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,754
Did I miss something?

947
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,297
Oh, wow.

948
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:01,780
I'm sorry.
The dinner to celebrate your promotion.

949
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:04,046
Second promotion. Great achievement.

950
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:05,380
Thank you, Dad.

951
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:08,467
Now you are here, we have krem torta.
I'm sorry.

952
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,428
Seriously, Marta, I am sorry.
It doesn't matter.

953
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,855
Oh, thanks a lot, Mum.
Your favorite.

954
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:15,432
I'm all right, actually.

955
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:17,768
Is there something wrong
with your favorite cake now?

956
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,602
No. I'm just not hungry.

957
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:24,362
There's always something, isn't there?
Like, you're hungry, you're not hungry.

958
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:28,411
You're tired, you're overexcited.
You've got a tummy ache.

959
00:53:29,248 --> 00:53:31,865
Gosh, you're so tiresome, Katarina.

960
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:34,042
Marta, it's "Kate."

961
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:35,438
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

962
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:38,170
You taught her this terrible word?
Of course not.

963
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:40,294
Do you even know
what nabijem te na kurac means?

964
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:41,465
Yeah, I actually do.

965
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:43,919
It means, "I will nail you to my dick."

966
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:46,049
Yeah, I knew that.
Not "dick." "Penis."

967
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,052
Well, "dick" means "penis."

968
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:50,475
Dick means penis?
Dick means penis.

969
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:52,928
No, Dick is our neighbor.
It also means penis.

970
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:55,187
Dick, our neighbor, is called penis?

971
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:56,685
Dick is penis. Penis is dick.

972
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,670
That's the same word.
Would you stop saying dick and penis?

973
00:53:58,694 --> 00:54:00,630
Just... I'm trying to explain.
Whatever, you know?

974
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:03,818
I'm just so bored of your shit.
Marta, stop. She's ill.

975
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,775
She's not ill anymore, Mum.
She is not ill anymore, Petra.

976
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:09,282
And what you know?
What you know anything about this family?

977
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:11,829
You're never here.
I'm not ill anymore, all right?

978
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,828
She is still ill. Why is she still working
in silly Christmas shop

979
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,331
when she was always the bright one?

980
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:19,750
Shh.

981
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:21,422
You are very hard worker.

982
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:26,173
Wha... Oh, right, yeah. Well, apparently,
with my pathetic, inferior little brain.

983
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:30,132
Now she's wasting her life,
which only a miracle save her.

984
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:33,343
Wasting my life. Thanks, Mum.
And you have job you dream of.

985
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:36,396
Yeah, except that I didn't dream of it,
did I? You did.

986
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:38,644
Dad can't be a lawyer here,
so I had to be,

987
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:41,101
no matter what I might have
actually wanted to do.

988
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:42,652
Would you rather drive minicab?

989
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:45,981
Look what it done to him.
He look thousand years old.

990
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,736
Oh, thanks.

991
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:50,138
And you, you sit there
and you think it's absolutely acceptable

992
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:51,389
to say that she's cleverer than me,

993
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,558
and I'm expected to swallow it
just because she's been ill.

994
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:54,823
Marta, calm down.

995
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:57,455
Don't you dare tell me to calm down,
all right?

996
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:00,036
Marta...
You don't care about anything,

997
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,588
Katarina, or Kate,
or whatever your name is now,

998
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:04,210
because you're ashamed of who you are.

999
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:06,088
Oh, I'm ashamed of who I am?

1000
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:08,716
What about you? Where's Alba?

1001
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:10,556
Shut up.

1002
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:13,475
On your big celebration dinner,
where is your girlfriend?

1003
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:18,020
Alba? Alba is... Alba is Marta's flatmate.

1004
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:21,599
And that's how it's always gonna be.
I bet she's really happy about that.

1005
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,522
What she say?

1006
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:27,863
God, you're a piece of work.

1007
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:32,823
Marta.

1008
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:34,988
Marta.
Marta.

1009
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:37,917
Eh...

1010
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:40,910
Eat. You look like skeleton.

1011
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:45,165
I got to go.

1012
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:47,713
Good-bye, Mum.

1013
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,094
I will nail you to my dick.

1014
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:08,652
So every day
I see you in some other face 

1015
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:11,608
They crack a smile, talk a while 

1016
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:14,695
And try to take your place 

1017
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:22,248
My memory
My memory serves me far too well 

1018
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:28,466
I just sit here on this mountain 

1019
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:30,714
Thinking to myself 

1020
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:33,888
You're a fool, boy
Why don't you go down 

1021
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:39,060
Find somebody
Find somebody else 

1022
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:44,733
My memory
My memory serves me far too well 

1023
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,982
Hey. What're you doing out so late?
Where have you been?

1024
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,733
What's up?
"What's up?"

1025
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,610
Me not being able
to find you is what's up.

1026
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:54,408
You just... You've been disappearing
for days on end.

1027
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,702
Two days.
And I've been trying to find you.

1028
00:56:56,788 --> 00:57:00,532
So take your stupid phone out of
your cupboard and contact me. 'Cause...

1029
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:05,955
Because I've just been really stupid.
I've been really, really stupid.

1030
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:09,381
It's a bit of a stretch,
but have you had a couple drinks?

1031
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:12,632
Oh, bugger off
with your cleanly manliness, all right?

1032
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:15,304
Just go back to work. Leave me alone.

1033
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,803
No, I've just come back
from helping the needy.

1034
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:18,929
Great.

1035
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:22,808
You know, just a bit of psych work.
I work with the severely distressed.

1036
00:57:22,898 --> 00:57:24,981
When they get off on one.
Oh.

1037
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:28,026
In fact, you're severely distressed
and have just gone off on one,

1038
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:30,068
so I'm glad
that we bumped into each other.

1039
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,487
Shall we go get my phone
from that cupboard?

1040
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:38,657
Okay.

1041
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:43,370
Let's go.

1042
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,076
Where are you taking me?

1043
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:48,000
Home.

1044
00:57:57,516 --> 00:57:58,927
It's down here.
Yeah.

1045
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:23,990
Come on in.

1046
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:34,046
Oh, wow. You weren't kidding.

1047
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:36,089
Place is so tidy.

1048
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,091
Come take a seat.
No. I can't.

1049
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,218
I'll crease something
or just spontaneously wee.

1050
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:42,971
I'm gonna sit on the floor.

1051
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,011
There's plenty of seats.

1052
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:48,268
Nice landing.

1053
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,185
You're not yourself.

1054
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:53,645
No?

1055
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:54,980
Maybe I'm wrong.

1056
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,689
Wrong about what?

1057
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:59,241
Maybe this is more you than anything.

1058
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:07,075
I'm a mess.

1059
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:09,706
Kind of.

1060
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:12,539
In here.

1061
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:20,717
When I was ill...

1062
00:59:22,434 --> 00:59:23,925
it was a heart thing.

1063
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,053
Right.

1064
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,306
I had a heart transplant.

1065
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,733
I don't tell people 'cause they get weird,

1066
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,811
but I don't think you'll get weird.

1067
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,317
No.

1068
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:46,785
Oh...

1069
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:51,877
Is this okay?

1070
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:14,646
They took out my heart.

1071
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:19,564
They took it and threw it away,

1072
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:22,651
and I...
and I don't know what they put back,

1073
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:25,202
but it felt weird

1074
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,371
and different and strange and...

1075
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:30,325
and like I'd lost my most special part.

1076
01:00:33,505 --> 01:00:36,373
And they kept telling me
I was lucky to be alive.

1077
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:39,758
But I didn't feel alive.

1078
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:41,336
I just felt half dead.

1079
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,682
Come here.

1080
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:03,907
I was supposed to be special.

1081
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:06,778
I didn't ask to be, but...

1082
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:09,413
they made me feel special when I was ill,

1083
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:13,209
and then I was special when I nearly died
and had a transplant, but...

1084
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:18,539
then they just expected me to be normal
and get on with life.

1085
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:21,717
There's no such thing as normal.

1086
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,590
It's a stupid word.

1087
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,421
Does a lot of damage.

1088
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,511
Nothing feels right.

1089
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:35,731
You're the only person

1090
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:38,025
that makes me feel, like, I don't know...

1091
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:42,525
solid.

1092
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,071
Like I exist.

1093
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:52,077
I'm a part-time cycle courier
who doesn't even have a phone.

1094
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:53,533
I know.

1095
01:01:53,627 --> 01:01:55,243
It's pretty sad.

1096
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:58,625
And I could sing before.

1097
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,206
Turns out,

1098
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,667
I can't do anything.

1099
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:09,515
I think the whole being-special thing
is overrated.

1100
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:15,479
I think just to be a human being is hard.

1101
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,272
You know, really hard.

1102
01:02:17,943 --> 01:02:19,434
You seem to manage all right.

1103
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:22,691
One thing someone said to me helped me.

1104
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,113
"Every little action of the common day

1105
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:30,661
makes or unmakes character."

1106
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:36,251
It just means
that you're built of everything you do.

1107
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:39,586
And that's okay.

1108
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,381
Who am I?

1109
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:49,013
I don't know.

1110
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,684
What's all this "me" business anyway, hmm?

1111
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,103
What's wrong with...

1112
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,556
not knowing, you know, being inconsistent?

1113
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:01,142
Just uncertain.

1114
01:03:01,236 --> 01:03:02,977
Why do you have to be anything?

1115
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:10,367
Tom?

1116
01:03:11,997 --> 01:03:13,078
Yeah?

1117
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:17,867
Can we lie down?

1118
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:20,415
Absolutely.

1119
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:23,247
Come on.
Okay.

1120
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:26,049
Oh. Gently does it.
Oh, my God.

1121
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:31,138
Jump in there.
Oh, the bed.

1122
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:32,556
In the bed there.

1123
01:03:33,852 --> 01:03:34,852
Bed!

1124
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,269
What...

1125
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:41,808
Tom, I said "we."

1126
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:45,319
This is close enough for now.
We hardly know each other.

1127
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:46,896
Wha... Uh.

1128
01:03:47,866 --> 01:03:50,279
What do you mean? We ju...

1129
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:53,987
I told you everything there is to know
about me. There is nothing more to know.

1130
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,618
You've just poured out
some very heavy-duty stuff.

1131
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:58,950
I think you should just sleep for a bit.

1132
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:01,877
Sing me to sleep?

1133
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:04,080
Like your mum?
No, no.

1134
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:06,131
Oh, dear God, not like my mum.

1135
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:08,300
I'm a terrible singer, really.

1136
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:10,503
Everyone can sing.
Mm-mmm. Not me.

1137
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,808
You sing. You're the singer.

1138
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,636
If I sing a lullaby...

1139
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:22,018
will you kiss me good night?

1140
01:04:29,908 --> 01:04:32,150
Let me tell you a secret 

1141
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:36,324
Put it in your heart and keep it 

1142
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:40,290
Something that I want you to know 

1143
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:43,870
Do something for me 

1144
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:47,335
Listen to my simple story 

1145
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:50,501
Maybe we'll have something to show 

1146
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:54,088
You tell me you're cold on the inside 

1147
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:57,341
How can the outside world 

1148
01:04:58,019 --> 01:05:01,308
Be a place
That your heart can embrace? 

1149
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,398
Be good to yourself 

1150
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:07,443
'Cause nobody else 

1151
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:12,065
Has the power to make you happy 

1152
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,385
Go to sleep.

1153
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:34,757
Mm.

1154
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:03,578
Let me tell you a secret 

1155
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:06,786
Put it in your heart and keep it 

1156
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,339
Something that I want you to know 

1157
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:12,633
Do something for me 

1158
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:16,429
Listen to my simple story 

1159
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:19,257
And maybe we'll have something to show 

1160
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,182
You tell me you're cold on the inside 

1161
01:06:21,269 --> 01:06:23,886
Can I get one of them?
There you go.

1162
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,437
How can the outside world 

1163
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:29,233
Be a place that your heart can embrace 

1164
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:31,185
Be good to yourself 

1165
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:35,193
'Cause nobody else has the power 

1166
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:38,447
They called today
the Brexit Betrayal Rally.

1167
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:40,072
And UKIP said...
Mum?

1168
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:42,200
Mum?
They hate us.

1169
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:44,998
You all right?
They send us all back.

1170
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:52,089
Hmm. You're early.

1171
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:54,337
Don't tell me even your mother
kicked you out.

1172
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:57,215
No, I'm just...
doing something for someone.

1173
01:06:57,305 --> 01:06:59,638
How was your date?
Really nice.

1174
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:01,431
Are you really gonna call him Boy?

1175
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:03,350
He likes it.
What does he do?

1176
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,678
He's an expert on sauerkraut.

1177
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:07,058
Mm, you're kidding.

1178
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:08,890
I wish I were.

1179
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:10,724
Now I must learn to love sauerkraut,

1180
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:13,526
which will be hard
because I am not a sour person.

1181
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:15,487
You'll do it for love.

1182
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:17,735
Hey, there's a latte for you on the shelf.

1183
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:22,869
What do you want?

1184
01:07:23,915 --> 01:07:24,915
Nothing.

1185
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:26,750
Then why?

1186
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:27,950
Uh...

1187
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:30,244
'cause it's Monday.

1188
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:31,795
Get to work.

1189
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:34,383
Okay.

1190
01:07:56,698 --> 01:07:57,698
Okay.

1191
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:13,204
Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh 

1192
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,539
O'er the fields we go 

1193
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:17,966
Laughing all the way 

1194
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:21,466
Bells on bobtail ring
Making spirits bright 

1195
01:08:21,556 --> 01:08:25,266
What fun it is to ride
And sing a sleighing song tonight 

1196
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:27,638
Hey, jingle bells, jingle bells 

1197
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:28,970
What have we here then?

1198
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:30,144
Jingle all the way 

1199
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:33,224
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh 

1200
01:08:33,318 --> 01:08:34,628
Hey, jingle bells, jingle bells 

1201
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:37,816
Uh, you know we could book you
for causing an obstruction?

1202
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:39,362
Oh, all right now,

1203
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:42,157
PC Trenchant Old Baggage, leave her alone.

1204
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:44,003
I'm just saying
she's causing an obstruction.

1205
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:45,744
Turn a blind eye.

1206
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:49,198
'Tis the season to be jolly
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la 

1207
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:51,158
That is quite the slippery slope.

1208
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:54,336
What next, huh?
Turn a blind eye to robbery?

1209
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:56,004
Oh, come on, you.
Arson?

1210
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:57,456
Come on, now.
Murder?

1211
01:08:57,550 --> 01:09:00,042
You have been like this all day.

1212
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,002
Laughing all the way, ha-ha-ha 

1213
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:05,009
Bells on bobtail ring
Making spirits bright 

1214
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:09,594
What fun it is to ride
And sing a sleighing song tonight 

1215
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:11,932
Hey 

1216
01:09:27,205 --> 01:09:28,992
Yeah!

1217
01:09:33,378 --> 01:09:34,664
Oh.

1218
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:44,170
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la 

1219
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:47,097
'Tis the season to be jolly 

1220
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:51,097
£5.75, two euros and a Fox's Glacier Mint.

1221
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:53,349
Less than minimum wage then.
Oi.

1222
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,681
Yeah, I know it's not much.

1223
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:58,358
No, that's an hour of pure heart and soul.

1224
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,564
That's riches, that is.

1225
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:02,237
Thanks.
You're welcome.

1226
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:04,944
So did you find your Tom, then?

1227
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:06,150
Yeah.

1228
01:10:06,244 --> 01:10:08,236
Nice. Good for you.

1229
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:09,536
Thank you.

1230
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:12,205
I'm just gonna leave that right there.

1231
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:13,873
Go nicely with your tea.

1232
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:16,160
See you soon.
See you.

1233
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:18,541
See you later.
Don't even know where that's been.

1234
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:20,293
Dan, she doesn't have to help, you know.

1235
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:23,922
Listen, I've seen more of these
little middle-class do-gooders

1236
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:25,422
than you've had hot dinners, mate.

1237
01:10:25,513 --> 01:10:28,426
Dan, I can't take your attitude.
You're so negative.

1238
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:31,099
Eat your mint.

1239
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:33,427
So I didn't get that Frozen job.

1240
01:10:33,521 --> 01:10:35,057
You're fired.

1241
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:37,105
It's funny.
I'm all right about it, actually.

1242
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:40,855
I'm not sure how I feel about
the whole auditioning thing in general.

1243
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:44,359
I'm not sure it's that good for me.
I might just give it a break.

1244
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:48,488
What's wrong with you?
What?

1245
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:50,615
That sounds like quite a healthy choice.

1246
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:54,039
I haven't heard you make one of those
in a very long time.

1247
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:57,084
Don't panic.
I will go out and get shit-faced later.

1248
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:03,089
You're rehired.
Ooh.

1249
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:09,296
Hello, Boy.

1250
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:16,561
It is a fermented mini cabbage hedge.

1251
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:18,064
Blimey.

1252
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:21,313
Thank you. It's beautiful.

1253
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:22,893
It was my grandmother's.

1254
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:25,737
Oh, that's lovely. That's very nice.

1255
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:27,780
Mm. Go away.

1256
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:33,988
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 

1257
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:36,198
Well, I guess it would be nice 

1258
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,705
If I could touch your body 

1259
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:40,787
I know not everybody 

1260
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,793
Has got a body like you, mmm 

1261
01:11:43,883 --> 01:11:46,921
But I gotta think twice 

1262
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:48,673
Before I give my heart away 

1263
01:11:48,763 --> 01:11:51,096
And I know all the games you play 

1264
01:11:51,182 --> 01:11:52,514
Because I play them too 

1265
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:56,597
Oh, but I need some time off 

1266
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:58,303
Donald, where's your troosers? 

1267
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:02,608
Time to pick my heart up off the floor 

1268
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:06,028
£27.35,

1269
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:08,150
some sort of a weird token thing

1270
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:09,823
and a Strepsil.

1271
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:13,319
It's coming along nicely.
Yeah, that's 'cause of Arthur.

1272
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:14,573
Bollocks it is.

1273
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:16,075
'Cause I gotta have faith 

1274
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,623
I gotta have faith 

1275
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:21,292
Because I got to have faith
Faith, faith 

1276
01:12:21,379 --> 01:12:23,607
Arthur, you do know
that you don't have to audition.

1277
01:12:23,631 --> 01:12:25,418
I want to.
But you're in.

1278
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:27,420
They'll think I'm a dick if I don't.

1279
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:28,821
Fair enough.
Fair enough. Yeah.

1280
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:33,215
There was a young lady called Flaurie 

1281
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:38,177
Who laid on her back in a quarry 

1282
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:41,059
"I'm ready," she cried 

1283
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:43,686
With her legs open wide 

1284
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:49,943
I'll have a blue Christmas 

1285
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:51,398
Without you 

1286
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:54,781
Melody, melody 

1287
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:58,114
God rest you merry gentlemen 

1288
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:02,038
I could drop quite easily.

1289
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:03,915
This is my floor show.

1290
01:13:04,005 --> 01:13:07,749
Land of hope and glory 

1291
01:13:18,019 --> 01:13:19,019
Thank you very much.

1292
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:27,813
So how's your Tom?
Oh, well, I just wish I knew.

1293
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:30,647
I haven't heard from him in days.
He's disappeared again.

1294
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:32,447
It's a bit annoying, if I'm honest.

1295
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:35,617
He seems to be disappearing a lot.
Is he a magician?

1296
01:13:35,703 --> 01:13:36,819
Well, you never know.

1297
01:13:37,455 --> 01:13:39,697
Probably just scared
of what he feels about you.

1298
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,281
You know, blokes and that.

1299
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:42,834
Yeah.

1300
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:46,378
Well...
Bon appétit.

1301
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:48,126
Boom. Thank you.

1302
01:13:48,215 --> 01:13:50,002
See you soon, Kate.
Bye.

1303
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,148
Hi.
Hey.

1304
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:40,598
Hi.

1305
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,101
Hi.

1306
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:46,313
How have you been?

1307
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,311
Missing you.

1308
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:19,012
Missing and kissing. It's almost like
we're having a relationship.

1309
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:27,104
Kate, there's something
I've got to tell you.

1310
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:30,891
Oh, God.

1311
01:15:30,985 --> 01:15:33,773
The "there's something
I've got to tell you" moment. Okay.

1312
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:35,980
Okay, let's go through the list. Um...

1313
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:41,117
You're gay?

1314
01:15:41,996 --> 01:15:43,487
No, it's...
Married?

1315
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:46,706
No, there's...
Uh, you need space?

1316
01:15:48,044 --> 01:15:51,583
You can't depend on me.
I don't depend on you.

1317
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:52,672
Kate.

1318
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:55,044
Who said anything
about depending on anyone?

1319
01:15:55,134 --> 01:15:56,716
Listen, you said it yourself.

1320
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:59,545
You've been having a tough time
after all the trauma and...

1321
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:01,742
Look, I'm just worried...
Oh, so now it's my issue?

1322
01:16:01,766 --> 01:16:04,008
No, you...
Look, if this is about commitment,

1323
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:06,935
then you just need to say it, because I...

1324
01:16:07,021 --> 01:16:09,638
I can't do this anymore.

1325
01:16:09,732 --> 01:16:11,268
I look for you.

1326
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:13,850
I look for you everywhere,
and you're never there.

1327
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:17,070
And it makes me feel
really bad about myself.

1328
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:22,902
And I'm finally getting better
and not feeling bad about myself.

1329
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:26,158
I'm not gonna heal my heart...

1330
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:30,534
and then give it to someone
who is going to break it.

1331
01:16:34,381 --> 01:16:36,247
I won't.
Kate...

1332
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:09,896
Why don't you lot go back
to where you came from?

1333
01:17:10,543 --> 01:17:15,004
Yeah, you. Speak English,
or get out of my sodding country.

1334
01:17:15,589 --> 01:17:16,921
All of you!

1335
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:06,675
Hello.
Hi. Alba?

1336
01:18:07,474 --> 01:18:09,090
I'm Kate.
Kate?

1337
01:18:09,185 --> 01:18:10,392
Katarina.

1338
01:18:11,896 --> 01:18:14,513
Yep. Just wondering if Marta was in.

1339
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:16,189
She doesn't want to talk to you.

1340
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:18,608
Yeah. Okay.

1341
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:20,647
I understand. Uh...

1342
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,738
Could you just tell her
that I'm very sorry?

1343
01:18:25,284 --> 01:18:27,526
That I will probably never stop
being sorry.

1344
01:18:28,329 --> 01:18:29,820
That I'm glad that she has you.

1345
01:18:31,498 --> 01:18:35,959
And I'm sorry that you and I never got
the chance to know each other.

1346
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:39,587
Wait.
Oh, for God's sake.

1347
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:44,839
Hi. Look, I'm sorry about everything.
Please don't come here uninvited again.

1348
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:48,262
I wish Mum and Dad knew you were happy.

1349
01:18:48,349 --> 01:18:50,341
It's none of their business.

1350
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:54,394
Saying sorry doesn't change everything.
You do understand that?

1351
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:57,523
Yeah.

1352
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:13,492
Oh, God. Hey.

1353
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:15,748
Look...

1354
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:19,331
We weren't so lucky, you and I.

1355
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:22,539
Mum is a piece of work.
You're right about that.

1356
01:19:23,926 --> 01:19:26,760
But I guess maybe
we're all a bit damaged in this family.

1357
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:30,297
And I do appreciate you stopping by.

1358
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:38,731
One second.

1359
01:19:41,986 --> 01:19:42,986
Hey.

1360
01:19:43,988 --> 01:19:45,195
Hi.

1361
01:19:45,281 --> 01:19:48,649
I was just... I was just wondering
if I could buy you a drink.

1362
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:49,983
You look like you need another.

1363
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:56,076
Actually, I don't.

1364
01:20:00,296 --> 01:20:01,582
I really don't.

1365
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:04,756
Thank you though.

1366
01:20:08,095 --> 01:20:10,382
So if you love me 

1367
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:12,964
Say you love me 

1368
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:19,267
But if you don't, just let me go 

1369
01:20:26,447 --> 01:20:28,154
Thanks.

1370
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:31,529
That is really nice. Mm.

1371
01:20:32,411 --> 01:20:33,527
Mm.

1372
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:35,953
Was that physical intimacy?

1373
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:39,165
That was minimal.

1374
01:20:40,127 --> 01:20:41,368
How's Boy?

1375
01:20:42,129 --> 01:20:44,121
Interesting. And weird.

1376
01:20:44,965 --> 01:20:47,127
I've never eaten
so much fermented cabbage.

1377
01:20:47,217 --> 01:20:51,006
Yuck. Have you had sex yet?

1378
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:54,714
No.
Hmm. All right.

1379
01:20:54,808 --> 01:20:57,221
And have you had sex with Tom yet?

1380
01:20:57,311 --> 01:20:59,177
No.
So?

1381
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:01,979
No, it's never gonna happen.
Why?

1382
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:06,647
We... He just won't commit because
he thinks I depend on him too much,

1383
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:10,981
and he basically said that I had made
a career out of being a victim.

1384
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:14,408
Hmm. I like this man.

1385
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:19,577
Let me see. "A very messy Christmas."

1386
01:21:22,044 --> 01:21:23,205
Hi, Mum.

1387
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:32,589
Ah, yeah.

1388
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:38,929
They're not gonna send you back.

1389
01:21:39,686 --> 01:21:42,349
You live here. This is your home.

1390
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:44,639
I know how it start.

1391
01:21:45,818 --> 01:21:47,400
They point a finger.

1392
01:21:48,195 --> 01:21:52,610
They say, "Those people,
they are reason your life is bad."

1393
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:56,193
And people believe. They believe.

1394
01:21:56,286 --> 01:21:57,493
I know.

1395
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:07,166
I blame the Poles.

1396
01:22:08,799 --> 01:22:09,799
Okay.

1397
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,052
Okay.

1398
01:22:15,139 --> 01:22:17,131
Cup of tea?

1399
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:21,051
Hmm? Nice cup of tea. Nice cup. Okay.

1400
01:22:21,145 --> 01:22:23,512
I won't let you down 

1401
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:25,847
I will not give you up 

1402
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:28,524
Gotta have some faith in the sound 

1403
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:31,523
It's the one good thing that I've got 

1404
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:33,946
I won't let you down 

1405
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:36,445
So please don't give me up 

1406
01:22:36,535 --> 01:22:40,825
'Cause I would really, really love
To stick around 

1407
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:42,075
Oh, yeah 

1408
01:22:48,589 --> 01:22:49,750
Cheers.

1409
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:57,758
Bravo, Mama 

1410
01:23:02,352 --> 01:23:05,436
Heaven knows I was just a young boy 

1411
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:08,060
Didn't know what I wanted to be 

1412
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:10,688
Didn't know
What I wanted to be 

1413
01:23:11,862 --> 01:23:15,902
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's
Pride and joy 

1414
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:18,324
And I guess it was enough for me 

1415
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:20,527
I say, I guess it was enough for me 

1416
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:23,162
Yeah?
It'll do.

1417
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:26,077
Sorry, mate.

1418
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:29,377
Brand-new clothes and a big, fat place
On your rock and roll TV 

1419
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:37,169
But today the way I play the game
Is not the same, no way 

1420
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:39,128
Tell Rufus
this one's much harder to torch.

1421
01:23:40,307 --> 01:23:41,969
I nearly popped the baby out then.

1422
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:46,470
I think there's something
you should know 

1423
01:23:46,563 --> 01:23:49,101
I think it's time I told you so 

1424
01:23:49,191 --> 01:23:51,774
There's something deep inside of me 

1425
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:54,318
There's someone else I've got to be 

1426
01:23:54,404 --> 01:23:56,771
Take back your picture in a frame 

1427
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:59,278
Take back your singing in the rain 

1428
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:01,951
I just hope you understand 

1429
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:04,700
Sometimes the clothes
do not make the man 

1430
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:08,875
All we have to do now 

1431
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:13,587
Is take these lies
And make them true somehow 

1432
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:19,503
All we have to see 

1433
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:21,838
Is that I don't belong to you 

1434
01:24:21,932 --> 01:24:23,514
Tom?

1435
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,661
And you don't belong to me 

1436
01:24:24,685 --> 01:24:26,551
No, that one is down 30 thou.

1437
01:24:26,645 --> 01:24:28,557
Yeah, it's a real turd of a flat.
Tom?

1438
01:24:29,273 --> 01:24:32,892
Someone's here. Look, okay, bye.
Sorry. It's been a mad day.

1439
01:24:32,985 --> 01:24:35,477
I'm Andy. Sorry I'm so casual.

1440
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:38,860
Oh, that's okay.
Are you Mrs. Challis?

1441
01:24:38,949 --> 01:24:41,566
No. No, sorry.
No, I didn't think you were.

1442
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:43,652
No. Are you waiting for Tom?

1443
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:45,702
Uh, I don't think so,
unless he's with you.

1444
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:47,200
No, I just came to find him.

1445
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:49,283
Oh, he'll probably turn up.
Right.

1446
01:24:49,376 --> 01:24:51,743
So, shall we get started, then?
Ooh, started on what?

1447
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:53,624
Just taking a little look, huh?

1448
01:24:57,217 --> 01:24:59,459
Right. I've looked, and there it is.

1449
01:24:59,553 --> 01:25:01,590
Small but compact. It's neat.

1450
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,172
That's one of its selling points.
It's for sale?

1451
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:06,303
Oh, yeah.
Freehold, this one. Not for rental.

1452
01:25:06,393 --> 01:25:08,055
That's why he keeps it so tidy.

1453
01:25:08,145 --> 01:25:10,728
Oh, yeah.
There's no room for clutter here.

1454
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:13,602
But there is plenty of storage space.

1455
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:16,856
Voila. Ah. What have we got here?

1456
01:25:17,613 --> 01:25:19,070
Oh, my God.

1457
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:24,993
Literally in the cupboard.
No wonder it died.

1458
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:27,240
I'll give it to him. Don't worry.
Give it to who?

1459
01:25:27,331 --> 01:25:29,038
Tom.
Who's that then?

1460
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:32,075
Tom, who lives here
but is selling the flat.

1461
01:25:32,169 --> 01:25:35,128
No. No one lives here.
It's been empty for months.

1462
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:36,420
Maybe he was squatting.

1463
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:39,169
What? Was there a squatter here?

1464
01:25:39,635 --> 01:25:41,592
Oh, bloody hell!
Um...

1465
01:25:41,678 --> 01:25:44,216
Excuse my language. It's typical, that is.

1466
01:25:44,306 --> 01:25:47,094
It's that probate stuff that stops us
from getting on with our jobs.

1467
01:25:47,184 --> 01:25:49,078
"Probate"?
Yeah. You know, when someone dies.

1468
01:25:49,102 --> 01:25:51,515
It's a pain in the fundament.
Who's died?

1469
01:25:51,605 --> 01:25:53,016
The previous owner.

1470
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:56,809
Who?
Uh, someone Webster, I think.

1471
01:25:56,902 --> 01:25:59,394
Youngish bloke. Sad, really.

1472
01:25:59,488 --> 01:26:01,354
It was last Christmas, by all accounts.

1473
01:26:35,691 --> 01:26:37,853
Madam. Hello.

1474
01:26:39,569 --> 01:26:41,731
Madam? Are you all right?

1475
01:26:42,447 --> 01:26:43,483
Yeah.

1476
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:46,233
You just sort of folded up.

1477
01:26:46,326 --> 01:26:48,613
Are you really all right?
Yeah.

1478
01:26:51,915 --> 01:26:55,534
These are the days of the open hand 

1479
01:26:56,503 --> 01:26:59,416
They will not be the last 

1480
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:01,922
Look around now 

1481
01:27:02,592 --> 01:27:08,213
These are the days
Of the beggars and the choosers 

1482
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:12,050
This is the year of the hungry man 

1483
01:27:12,853 --> 01:27:15,687
Whose place is in the past 

1484
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:18,606
Hand in hand 

1485
01:27:19,651 --> 01:27:20,651
Hi.

1486
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:25,151
With ignorance
And legitimate excuses 

1487
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:29,154
The rich declare themselves poor 

1488
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:32,703
And most of us are not sure 

1489
01:27:33,373 --> 01:27:35,410
If we have too much 

1490
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:37,742
But we'll take our chances 

1491
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:40,829
'Cause God's stopped keeping score 

1492
01:27:41,631 --> 01:27:44,920
I guess somewhere along the way 

1493
01:27:46,303 --> 01:27:47,464
Oi!

1494
01:27:47,554 --> 01:27:49,546
He must have let us all out to play 

1495
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:55,427
Turned his back and all God's children 

1496
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,228
Crept out the back door 

1497
01:27:59,024 --> 01:28:01,892
And it's hard to love, mmm 

1498
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:05,444
There's so much to hate 

1499
01:28:06,782 --> 01:28:10,116
Hanging on to hope 

1500
01:28:11,161 --> 01:28:14,745
When there is no hope to speak of 

1501
01:28:15,332 --> 01:28:19,702
And the wounded skies above 

1502
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:23,413
Say it's much too late 

1503
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:29,092
Maybe we should all 

1504
01:28:29,179 --> 01:28:32,547
Be praying for 

1505
01:28:32,641 --> 01:28:34,428
Time 

1506
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:41,356
Do you think we have time? 

1507
01:28:45,946 --> 01:28:49,314
Do you think we have time? 

1508
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:00,661
Why can I feel you?

1509
01:29:04,214 --> 01:29:05,955
Because I'm a part of you.

1510
01:29:09,094 --> 01:29:10,835
Take care of my heart.

1511
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:13,505
I promise.

1512
01:29:14,808 --> 01:29:17,141
It was always going to be yours
one way or another.

1513
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:52,066
Come in here! Roll up!
Roll up, you shower of gobblers.

1514
01:30:52,155 --> 01:30:54,647
You, you load of tossers, in.

1515
01:30:54,741 --> 01:30:56,636
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dora, Dora, Dora.
And you're a tosser too.

1516
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:58,697
I'm loving the work.
Wrong vibe, though, yeah?

1517
01:30:58,787 --> 01:31:01,325
You can't call the audience names.
And you're a wanker.

1518
01:31:01,414 --> 01:31:03,121
Don't I know it, Dora.

1519
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:34,486
Hi.

1520
01:31:34,572 --> 01:31:36,905
Hello, hello, hello.

1521
01:31:36,992 --> 01:31:41,157
Um, right. So, I knew the lighting
would be crap, so I brought my own.

1522
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:50,123
Yes, yes, yes. Thank you.
All right, we've got lots to get through.

1523
01:31:50,213 --> 01:31:53,957
I just want to say a massive thank-you to
everyone who's put so much hard work in.

1524
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:58,465
Mum, for making the most ginormous
krempita I think everyone enjoyed.

1525
01:32:02,475 --> 01:32:05,809
My mother, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you. Thank you.

1526
01:32:05,895 --> 01:32:07,431
You're famous for your krempita.

1527
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:12,062
I'd like to thank everyone individually,
but Dan said no speeches were allowed.

1528
01:32:12,152 --> 01:32:13,393
Yeah. Now, get off, Elf.

1529
01:32:13,486 --> 01:32:15,603
Yes. Thank you, Daniel.

1530
01:32:15,697 --> 01:32:17,609
Seconds away. I just, um...

1531
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:20,195
I just want to say this one thing.

1532
01:32:20,744 --> 01:32:24,784
We are so lucky to be alive.

1533
01:32:25,415 --> 01:32:26,747
Hear, hear.

1534
01:32:27,917 --> 01:32:32,537
We are so lucky
to be able to help each other

1535
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:35,589
in little ways and in big ways.

1536
01:32:36,259 --> 01:32:40,128
The reason we are lucky is because

1537
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:43,464
helping each other is, in fact,

1538
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:45,470
what makes us happy.

1539
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,927
That's all.

1540
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:51,017
Give us a song, Kate!

1541
01:32:51,107 --> 01:32:52,598
A song?

1542
01:32:54,235 --> 01:32:55,942
Yeah, I think I've got one up my sleeve.

1543
01:33:00,283 --> 01:33:02,696
Last Christmas 

1544
01:33:02,786 --> 01:33:04,573
I gave you my heart 

1545
01:33:05,288 --> 01:33:07,780
But the very next day 

1546
01:33:07,874 --> 01:33:09,581
You gave it away 

1547
01:33:10,418 --> 01:33:12,626
This year 

1548
01:33:12,712 --> 01:33:14,874
To save me from tears 

1549
01:33:16,216 --> 01:33:18,674
I'll give it to someone special 

1550
01:33:34,359 --> 01:33:37,318
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart 

1551
01:33:37,403 --> 01:33:41,317
But the very next day
You gave it away 

1552
01:33:41,407 --> 01:33:44,741
This year, to save me from tears 

1553
01:33:44,828 --> 01:33:47,616
I'll give it to someone special 

1554
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,783
Once bitten and twice shy 

1555
01:33:52,418 --> 01:33:55,877
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye 

1556
01:33:55,964 --> 01:33:57,500
Tell me, baby 

1557
01:33:57,590 --> 01:34:00,003
Do you recognize me?
No!

1558
01:34:00,093 --> 01:34:02,551
It's been a year
It doesn't surprise me 

1559
01:34:02,637 --> 01:34:04,299
Merry Christmas!

1560
01:34:04,389 --> 01:34:06,255
I wrapped it up and sent it 

1561
01:34:06,349 --> 01:34:09,717
With a note saying, "I love you"
I meant it 

1562
01:34:09,811 --> 01:34:12,770
Now I know what a fool I've been 

1563
01:34:12,856 --> 01:34:16,850
But if you kiss me now
I know you'd fool me again 

1564
01:34:16,943 --> 01:34:20,027
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart 

1565
01:34:20,113 --> 01:34:23,982
But the very next day
You gave it away 

1566
01:34:24,075 --> 01:34:27,364
This year, to save me from tears 

1567
01:34:27,453 --> 01:34:30,321
I'll give it to someone special 

1568
01:34:31,457 --> 01:34:34,165
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart 

1569
01:34:34,252 --> 01:34:38,212
But the very next day
You gave it away 

1570
01:34:38,298 --> 01:34:41,587
This year, to save me from tears 

1571
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:44,544
I'll give it to someone special 

1572
01:35:11,831 --> 01:35:15,415
And now, on with the show!

1573
01:35:29,974 --> 01:35:31,681
Christmas tiramisu.

1574
01:35:33,978 --> 01:35:35,765
Nice!
Amazing!

1575
01:35:35,855 --> 01:35:38,973
Thank you, Alba.
Marta is so...

1576
01:35:39,067 --> 01:35:42,856
She is so lucky to have you, because she...

1577
01:35:42,946 --> 01:35:46,110
she is very, very

1578
01:35:46,199 --> 01:35:47,940
bad cook, very bad.

1579
01:35:48,034 --> 01:35:50,617
Mum, that isn't a compliment.
That's just rude.

1580
01:35:50,703 --> 01:35:53,116
What is rude? Why? Why is rude?

1581
01:35:53,206 --> 01:35:56,324
I am being nice to Alba, your girlfriend.

1582
01:35:57,085 --> 01:35:59,668
What I say? Nothing. Katarina.

1583
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:02,121
Yes.
Before we eat lesbian pudding...

1584
01:36:02,215 --> 01:36:03,581
Yep.
Mum!

1585
01:36:03,675 --> 01:36:06,588
What? You have your song,
your big song in party.

1586
01:36:06,678 --> 01:36:09,091
Yes.
I know I not so important to do that.

1587
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:10,637
Oh, Mum!

1588
01:36:10,723 --> 01:36:12,715
Hey, you are. Yes, you are.
I not.

1589
01:36:12,809 --> 01:36:16,803
Tell her she is. Yeah.
Now I sing an old song from Croatia,

1590
01:36:17,689 --> 01:36:20,648
from my grandmother, for my family.

1591
01:36:38,042 --> 01:36:41,626
Oh, come on, Petra.
The war is over long time ago.

1592
01:36:41,713 --> 01:36:44,205
Stop killing us with the song.

1593
01:36:44,299 --> 01:36:47,542
Sing it cheerfully, for God's sake.
What it's mean, "cheerfully"?

1594
01:36:47,635 --> 01:36:49,968
Veselo. It's Christmas!

1595
01:37:00,898 --> 01:37:01,898
Come on!

1596
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:12,240
So you raise another glass 

1597
01:37:12,327 --> 01:37:16,913
Looking for a different space 

1598
01:37:16,998 --> 01:37:20,617
I was leaning on the grass 

1599
01:37:20,710 --> 01:37:25,546
Dreaming of a sunnier day 

1600
01:37:25,631 --> 01:37:29,090
Oh, it never came 

1601
01:37:29,177 --> 01:37:33,638
How could it have, baby? 

1602
01:37:33,723 --> 01:37:37,342
Where the present meets the past 

1603
01:37:37,435 --> 01:37:41,645
It's hard to be more than we've seen 

1604
01:37:42,732 --> 01:37:45,145
Your daddy was a drinker 

1605
01:37:46,069 --> 01:37:51,030
Just kept drinking till the shit
He was thinking sounded true 

1606
01:37:51,115 --> 01:37:54,074
Your mama was a thinker 

1607
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:55,947
She just wasn't thinking 

1608
01:37:56,037 --> 01:38:00,623
On the day that she looked at him
And said "I do" 

1609
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:04,827
'Cause I will always, I will always
I will always, I will always 

1610
01:38:04,921 --> 01:38:07,834
Try to get my shit together 

1611
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:12,380
I guess we always
Guess we always knew 

1612
01:38:12,470 --> 01:38:15,338
That it would be stormy weather 

1613
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:18,344
This is how we want you to get high 

1614
01:38:18,434 --> 01:38:20,471
The way that we showed you 

1615
01:38:20,561 --> 01:38:23,725
The way that we told you was decent 

1616
01:38:23,815 --> 01:38:27,900
This is how we want you to get high 

1617
01:38:27,985 --> 01:38:32,320
This is how we want you to get by 

1618
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:35,570
My daddy was a toker 

1619
01:38:36,369 --> 01:38:41,285
Just kept smoking till the jokes
He could tell got very blue 

1620
01:38:41,374 --> 01:38:44,583
My mama was a joker 

1621
01:38:44,669 --> 01:38:46,080
If she was a hippie 

1622
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:50,756
Then I guess she was trippin'
On a high love you 

1623
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:55,086
'Cause I will always, I will always
I will always, I will always 

1624
01:38:55,179 --> 01:38:58,047
Try to get my shit together 

1625
01:38:59,225 --> 01:39:02,639
I guess we always
Guess we always knew 

1626
01:39:02,728 --> 01:39:05,562
That it would be stormy weather 

1627
01:39:05,648 --> 01:39:08,482
This is how we want you to get high 

1628
01:39:08,568 --> 01:39:10,651
The way that we showed you 

1629
01:39:10,736 --> 01:39:13,945
The way that we told you was decent 

1630
01:39:14,031 --> 01:39:18,150
This is how we want you to get high 

1631
01:39:18,244 --> 01:39:21,237
This is how we want you to get by 

1632
01:39:21,330 --> 01:39:24,573
On your sorry lives 

1633
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:31,667
Take another, take another 

1634
01:39:38,764 --> 01:39:41,427
I never picked a fight in my life 

1635
01:39:41,517 --> 01:39:43,474
Or raised a hand to my wife 

1636
01:39:43,561 --> 01:39:47,271
Or saw my children as things to bully 

1637
01:39:47,356 --> 01:39:49,723
I never dropped a pill in a drink 

1638
01:39:49,817 --> 01:39:52,025
I know how low you can sink 

1639
01:39:52,111 --> 01:39:55,946
My heart
My heart is better than that 

1640
01:39:56,032 --> 01:40:00,151
I never picked a fight in my life
Or raised a hand to my wife 

1641
01:40:00,244 --> 01:40:03,828
Or saw my children as things to bully 

1642
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:06,453

1643
01:40:06,542 --> 01:40:08,829
I know how low you can sink 

1644
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:13,415
My heart
My heart is better than that 

1645
01:40:18,554 --> 01:40:22,639
