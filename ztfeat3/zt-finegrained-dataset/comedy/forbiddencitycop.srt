Luk Siu Fung

8
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,840
the duel of 2 great swordsmen

9
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,356
Yes

00:00:46,371 --> 00:00:47,599
Sai Mun Tsui-suet and

29
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,543

And me, Fa Moon-lau ,

And me,
a lovely hero with 4 eye-brows

33
00:01:54,773 --> 00:01:55,842

Luk Siu-fung?

36
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:05,895
Lovely hero?

37
00:02:07,018 --> 00:02:08,656
You know you`re bothering 2 swordsmen
to have their duel?

38
00:02:09,321 --> 00:02:10,470
Who are you?

39
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:11,724
Secret Agent Ling Ling Fat

40
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,669
l`m responsible to protect
His Majesty

41
00:02:13,725 --> 00:02:15,204
and his properties

42
00:02:15,794 --> 00:02:18,024
Listen ,

43
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:20,384
you old folks!

44
00:02:20,499 --> 00:02:21,932

You`re charged of
illegal gathering , too

00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,248
And haven`t behaved yourselves
in public area

48
00:02:26,538 --> 00:02:28,733
Hey, don`t call us old folks!

49
00:02:28,907 --> 00:02:30,977
Great swordsmen may not
always be handsome

50
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,773
Handsome heroes are just

51
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,847
the expectations of ordinary people

52
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,395
Yes

53
00:02:36,515 --> 00:02:37,948
Heroes will have bald head too

54
00:02:38,149 --> 00:02:41,107
But not as ugly as your are!

55
00:02:44,723 --> 00:02:45,997
Please give us a chance!

56
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,907
This is a precious secret
scroll of Kung-fu

57
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,363
Take it

58
00:02:50,228 --> 00:02:51,456
Uncuff us at once

59
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,758
You want to exchange your freedam
with such poor book?

60
00:02:53,164 --> 00:02:54,438
Stop dreaming

61
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,749
Haven`t you heard of my name?

62
00:02:56,835 --> 00:02:58,314
Of course not! You`re not that famous

63
00:02:58,603 --> 00:02:59,592
Get lost

64
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:00,823
Young man , better give us face

65
00:03:01,373 --> 00:03:02,965

67
00:03:04,776 --> 00:03:06,095
l won`t give you face, anyway

68
00:03:06,211 --> 00:03:08,725
Bastard ! You`d respect the blind

69
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,692
Since you`re blind , don`t climb up!

70
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,607
Or, you`ll fall to death , old man

71
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,427
You`ve gone too far!

72
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:18,298
Once l attack
with my Wonder Fingers. . .

73
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:20,339
Wonder Finger? l have one too

74
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:22,693
All of you , on the floor,
hands on your heads,

75
00:03:22,794 --> 00:03:24,113
you`re now under arrest

76
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:25,721
l think you`ll be put to jail
not less than 1 0 years

77
00:03:25,864 --> 00:03:27,263
l won`t let you go this time

78
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:28,635
What a shame!

79
00:03:29,134 --> 00:03:30,203
Pals,

80
00:03:30,268 --> 00:03:31,223
let`s forget this ignorant guy

81
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:32,304
Let`s choose another day
for the fight

82
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,318
So powerful !

83
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,874
Members of the Secret Agent

We`ll be your Majesty`s loyal
servants forever

89
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,837
We`ll be your Majesty`s loyal
servants forever

90
00:06:17,268 --> 00:06:18,144
lron Clothe!

91
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:26,720
lt breaks

92
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:27,402
Yes. . .

93
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,331
Great!

94
00:07:09,187 --> 00:07:10,336
Unbreakable Armor

Bravo!

102
00:08:20,592 --> 00:08:21,911
What`s up?

103
00:08:21,926 --> 00:08:24,042
These 2 stones are found
in the very North

104
00:08:23,995 --> 00:08:25,986
There are 2 sides, with amazing power

105
00:08:26,264 --> 00:08:28,539
lf positive side face the positive
side, they`ll reject each other

106
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,782
They can`t stick together

107
00:08:29,868 --> 00:08:31,984
lf the positve side faces the
negative side,

108
00:08:32,036 --> 00:08:32,832
they`ll stick together

109
00:08:32,737 --> 00:08:33,886
Very amazing !

110
00:08:33,872 --> 00:08:36,022
lt`s a great discovery

111
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,389
l`d like to devote it to you

112
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,659
What`s the use of it?

113
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:46,223
Girls,

114
00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:47,764
you need not sway the fan
so hardly from now on

115
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,434
That two aren`t attractive,

116
00:08:49,387 --> 00:08:50,422
how about this?

117
00:08:51,189 --> 00:08:52,508
Put these 2 leaves together,

118
00:08:52,624 --> 00:08:54,216
and move it with great speed

119
00:08:54,292 --> 00:08:56,203
So a strong wind . . .

120
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,673
. . .will be created

121
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:03,953
You said ,

122
00:09:03,968 --> 00:09:04,923
if the weather is hot,

123
00:09:04,802 --> 00:09:05,837
this new product would be wonderful !

124
00:09:06,371 --> 00:09:07,690
ls Your Majesty interested in being

125
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,264
a sole agent of my product?

126
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,409
Your Majesty,

127
00:09:10,475 --> 00:09:11,544
l`ve not given
my subordinates good guidance

128
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:12,611
l`d be blamed !

129
00:09:12,944 --> 00:09:15,014
Ling Ling Fat, behave yourself

130
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,679
Yes

131
00:09:16,648 --> 00:09:17,763
l`ve got a way to defeat
your lron Clothe

132
00:09:17,715 --> 00:09:18,352
Fat-yan

133
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,144
l`m coming

134
00:09:24,222 --> 00:09:26,861
l`ve discovered that,

135
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,108
if l put carbon , Nitre and sulphur
in a small space,

136
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,978
say, inside one`s mouth

137
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,414
And , one tiny steel ball is put in

138
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,949
Then explode it

139
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:37,936
When an explosion is happened inside,

140
00:09:37,835 --> 00:09:38,984
solid becomes gas form ,

141
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,026
and the expansion create great power

142
00:09:40,104 --> 00:09:41,378
So the steel ball will be pushed out

143
00:09:41,506 --> 00:09:43,497
The power is so great that
it can break stone and metal

144
00:09:43,641 --> 00:09:45,632
lron clothe will become a mess

145
00:09:46,077 --> 00:09:46,714
What did you say?

146
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:48,427
Great! Come here

147
00:09:50,415 --> 00:09:51,734
Fat-yan , are you ready?

148
00:09:57,755 --> 00:09:59,234
The only demerit of this weapon is. . .

149
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,579
High temperature will be caused

150
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:04,810
So Fat-yan`s mouth must be
under series of special training

151
00:10:05,964 --> 00:10:07,841
say, eat hot dumplings

152
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,211
as training step no. one

153
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,550
or, drink very hot soup

154
00:10:13,304 --> 00:10:16,182
Now, Fat-yan`s mouth can stand
temperature of 1 00° C

155
00:10:17,342 --> 00:10:18,775
l tell you ,

156
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,540
he can eat hot shark-fin
soup faster than anyone else,

157
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:21,241
so, he can eat much more than us

158
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:22,607
But. . .

159
00:10:22,613 --> 00:10:24,843
Kids should not learn this

160
00:10:32,957 --> 00:10:33,946
Make it or not?

161
00:10:37,862 --> 00:10:39,056
lt`s almost successful

162
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,802
l feel that my mouth has had gone

163
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,248
No, it becomes bigger only

164
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,435
How big is it?

165
00:10:43,701 --> 00:10:45,453
Very big , don`t worry

166
00:10:46,304 --> 00:10:48,420
lt`s almost done!

167
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:51,112
Give me some time to amend it,

168
00:10:51,075 --> 00:10:51,666
l think l can . . .

169
00:10:51,676 --> 00:10:52,791

310
00:16:59,443 --> 00:17:01,593

Now, l will give you this hand

314
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,143
So, you can use your hand
to catch this hand

And use this hand to hold the onion

316
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:14,405
Even you cut your hand ,
it`ll be a fake hand

317
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,326
Your own hand won`t be hurt!

You said ,

325
00:17:27,204 --> 00:17:28,319

00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:35,971
And you can clean the floor
while you are walking

00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,715
Open your mouth

331

00:17:59,503 --> 00:18:00,652
So. . .

340
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:01,493
Let`s sleep

341
00:18:01,405 --> 00:18:02,440
But l want to try this!

342
00:18:03,007 --> 00:18:04,326
No, try this

343
00:18:11,115 --> 00:18:12,343
lt`s rat!

344
00:18:12,349 --> 00:18:14,943
This time, l`ll use rat`s movement
to release power

345
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,612
And it will push the wheel
to increase the power,

346
00:18:17,655 --> 00:18:19,293
it`s powerful enough to move this!

347
00:18:20,491 --> 00:18:23,483
lt can support weight
over 200 catties

348
00:18:24,295 --> 00:18:27,367
How about the steam machine
we used last time?

349
00:18:27,832 --> 00:18:30,027
lt`s good , but when it is dried ,

350
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,349
it will stop at once

351
00:18:31,535 --> 00:18:32,445
lsn`t this better?

352
00:18:33,137 --> 00:18:34,172
You are right

353
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,227
But, something is missing

354
00:18:35,473 --> 00:18:37,031
And this is the greatest breakthrough
l`ve ever made

355
00:18:37,475 --> 00:18:38,464
Now, we can choose different grade
of speed

356
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:40,134
for different needs

357
00:18:40,344 --> 00:18:41,572
Look!

358
00:18:48,385 --> 00:18:50,421
What does that ``Rear`` mean?

359
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:51,869
That`s backward !

360
00:18:52,456 --> 00:18:53,093
Let me try

361
00:18:53,224 --> 00:18:54,339
No!

362
00:19:09,673 --> 00:19:10,344
Does it work?

363
00:19:10,508 --> 00:19:11,987
Sure,

364
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,251
l cook with this
super turning shovel

365
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,553
Not even a drop of oil can dirty me

366
00:19:16,747 --> 00:19:18,066
Sure,

367
00:19:18,048 --> 00:19:20,084
but l mean the air system machine!

368
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,399
That machine?

369
00:19:21,485 --> 00:19:22,634
Show me once

370
00:19:30,895 --> 00:19:32,263
lt works,

371
00:19:32,263 --> 00:19:34,857
this is effective

372
00:19:35,399 --> 00:19:36,832
You can take this as practice

373
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:39,283
Yeah , it`s good to health

374
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:39,986
Hubby

375
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:40,641
Honey

376
00:19:40,604 --> 00:19:41,241
Hubby

377
00:19:41,238 --> 00:19:41,829
Honey

378
00:19:41,906 --> 00:19:42,895
Hubby

379
00:19:42,773 --> 00:19:43,364
l`ll let you play

380
00:19:43,407 --> 00:19:44,522
Great

381
00:20:01,191 --> 00:20:03,751
The one who is like
a ghost has arrived

382
00:20:07,364 --> 00:20:08,353
What`s wrong with you?

383
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,835
Doctor. . .

384
00:20:11,936 --> 00:20:13,005
Just between you and me!

385
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,906
lt`s enough for you
to disguise as woman

386
00:20:14,939 --> 00:20:17,407
lt`s not necessary for you
to talk like a woman !

387
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,620
Being a member of
the Forbidden City Cops,

388
00:20:20,711 --> 00:20:24,909
l should try my very best
to cover my identity

389
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:26,946
Better be careful

390
00:20:29,386 --> 00:20:31,980
Doctor. . .

391
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,350
Am l pregnant?

392
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,376
Yes, eat this for abortion

393
00:20:38,596 --> 00:20:40,075
What else do you want to say?

394
00:20:40,497 --> 00:20:41,612
Fat-yan said . . .

395
00:20:41,765 --> 00:20:43,323
Don`t talk like a woman

396
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:45,267
Fat-yan said . . .

397
00:20:45,235 --> 00:20:47,226
Lie down , don`t let me see your face

398
00:20:48,105 --> 00:20:49,379
Fat-yan said . . .

399
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,189
An important mission is for you ,
go back to the Headquarters

400
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,526
Better say earlier!

401
00:20:59,016 --> 00:21:00,449
Fat, be smart

402
00:21:00,517 --> 00:21:03,634
This important mission is counted
on you

403
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,600
We`ve had banquets in
the headquarters in these nights

404
00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:10,208
if you can`t clean
all the dishes tonight,

405
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,310
you will be put to jail

406
00:21:12,963 --> 00:21:15,477
Here comes His Majesty

407
00:21:18,135 --> 00:21:20,126
l`ve got a message that,
inside the territory of Gum Kingdom ,

408
00:21:20,104 --> 00:21:22,493
Something mysterious happened
last month , that is

409
00:21:22,673 --> 00:21:25,312
a creature called ``Flying Fairy``
fell down from heaven

410
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,112
Thus, they called meeting for
all famous doctors in our country

411
00:21:28,178 --> 00:21:30,214
ln order to dissect the Flying Fairy

412
00:21:30,814 --> 00:21:32,964
Dissect Flying Fairy?

413
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,808
Under the great leadership
of Your Majesty,

414
00:21:34,885 --> 00:21:37,001
how come such ridiculous
thing happens?

415
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,458
l am sure this is the trick
of the cheaters

416
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,190
Do you still want to go?

417
00:21:42,192 --> 00:21:44,547
Only the fool will be cheated !

418
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,244
l do want to take a look

419
00:21:46,664 --> 00:21:48,416
You know it is ridiculous,

420
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:50,515
but Your Majesty still
want to face it,

421
00:21:50,734 --> 00:21:53,646
you are so brave, so courageous!

422
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:55,232
Only under the leadership of. . .

423
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,388
. . .such brave and smart emperor,

424
00:21:57,374 --> 00:22:00,525
our country will be prosperous
and stable

425
00:22:00,544 --> 00:22:01,772
Long life to Your Majesty

426
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,389
The people of Gum Kingdom are always
cunning , it may be a trap

427
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,554
lf you go, it may be dangerous

428
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,187
Forget it

429
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,765
lf you don`t finish washing these,
you`ll be more dangerous

430
00:22:11,055 --> 00:22:12,773
But it`s my duty to remind
Your Majesty

431
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,364
Long life to Your Majesty

432
00:22:14,358 --> 00:22:15,552
Bravo

433
00:22:15,592 --> 00:22:17,264
Kung Hei Choi , you`ll protect me

434
00:22:17,494 --> 00:22:18,643
we will set out tomorrow

435
00:22:18,762 --> 00:22:19,353
Yes

436
00:22:19,396 --> 00:22:24,072
Long life Your Majesty

437
00:22:24,935 --> 00:22:26,732
Fat, cut the crap,

438
00:22:26,937 --> 00:22:29,053
His Majesty doesn`t want to hear
your voice

439
00:22:29,273 --> 00:22:30,547
lf you say anything nonsense,
your head will be chopped off

440
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:33,527
Wash the dishes. . .

441
00:22:39,183 --> 00:22:43,222
Thank God , you are saved !

442
00:22:43,387 --> 00:22:44,536
You wash my dishes

443
00:22:52,129 --> 00:22:53,482
There must be conspiracy!

444
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:57,090
China is stable and prosperous

445
00:22:57,134 --> 00:22:59,125
The beautiful women are
specially beautiful

446
00:22:59,303 --> 00:23:02,215
The handsome men are
specially handsome

447
00:23:04,074 --> 00:23:06,065
l hope that our flag of Gum Sect,

448
00:23:06,076 --> 00:23:07,794
will be found on their soil

449
00:23:08,145 --> 00:23:10,181
The Chinese soldiers are poor
in health

450
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,584
The dissection of Flying Fairy is. . .

451
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,965
. . .to gather the Chinese doctors,

452
00:23:14,618 --> 00:23:16,017
then , we will launch an attack to
the Chinese troops

453
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,158
Since they have no doctors,

454
00:23:18,255 --> 00:23:19,973
our troops can march from the North
to South with ease

455
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,205
lt`ll be a piece of cake for us. . .

456
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:24,089
. . .to conquer China

457
00:23:33,637 --> 00:23:34,706
You bastard ,

458
00:23:34,805 --> 00:23:36,363
you look like a dummy,

459
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,032
especially when you smile!

460
00:23:38,008 --> 00:23:39,202
l don`t know
why you are so dummy looking !

461
00:23:41,178 --> 00:23:42,497
Stop it!

462
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:44,595
l`m like a dummy whenever l see you

463
00:23:44,515 --> 00:23:46,506
When l see daddy,
l seem to be more foolish !

464
00:23:50,587 --> 00:23:52,578
Don`t you like my look?

465
00:23:52,823 --> 00:23:53,972
Your dad ruined . . .

466
00:23:53,857 --> 00:23:55,813
. . .his face,

467
00:23:55,826 --> 00:23:57,703
because of practising
``No Face`s Stance``!

468
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,040
A 2

469
00:24:15,612 --> 00:24:17,682
l four

470
00:24:18,348 --> 00:24:19,098
Got it?

471
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:19,594
Bingo

472
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:26,317
D 4 and 7

473
00:24:26,657 --> 00:24:30,650
H 2 5

474
00:24:31,495 --> 00:24:32,245
Got it?

475
00:24:32,196 --> 00:24:32,912
Two Six

476
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,059
Two Six

477
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:34,813
Try Two Five again

478
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,015
Two Five

479
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:36,778
Go back to 2 6

480
00:24:37,534 --> 00:24:38,284
2 and 6

481
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,151
Got it?

482
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,137
Yes

483
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:42,407
Where do you feel itchy?

484
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,779
C 1 3 4 6 8 plus D 1

485
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:47,965
And , A 2 , E 4

486
00:24:49,146 --> 00:24:50,465
Got it?

487
00:24:51,582 --> 00:24:53,573
You are so stupid !
You won`t make it like this!

488
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,281
l am stupid ,
that`s why you look smart

489
00:24:55,485 --> 00:24:56,884
Please don`t say l am smart

490
00:24:57,921 --> 00:24:59,832
But your inventions are
really wonderful

491
00:24:59,756 --> 00:25:00,427
Who said so?

492
00:25:00,424 --> 00:25:01,493
l said it

493
00:25:01,592 --> 00:25:02,547
What`s your name?

494
00:25:02,526 --> 00:25:03,436
Lau

495
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,509
Who are you?

496
00:25:04,561 --> 00:25:05,596
l am your wife

497
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,099
Shit!

498
00:25:06,063 --> 00:25:06,893
Shit!

499
00:25:07,064 --> 00:25:08,099
Come on , don`t scold me

500
00:25:08,198 --> 00:25:09,950
You scolded me first

501
00:25:11,001 --> 00:25:12,593
You are the only one who praises me,

502
00:25:12,669 --> 00:25:14,022
but what`s the use of it?

503
00:25:14,438 --> 00:25:15,587
l don`t care!

504
00:25:15,739 --> 00:25:16,854
l think you are really great

505
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,168
You are great,

But never blame me as scapegoat

516
00:25:34,424 --> 00:25:35,413
Since you are familiar with me

517

lts eye is so big

677
00:35:41,464 --> 00:35:42,977
Will it be clearer?

678
00:35:42,999 --> 00:35:44,637
Where is its wing?
How can it fly then?

679
00:35:44,868 --> 00:35:45,983
lt`s really weird !

00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,630
Move, move now

Give her some medicine?

685
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,667

Don`t move

691

Do you know how to dissect?

692
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,924
Cut from the throat,

697
00:36:36,252 --> 00:36:38,083
You coward , you needn`t find excuse

Good question , l`ve just fixed it

703
00:37:29,105 --> 00:37:30,254

Someone chopped you?

That`s him !

708
00:37:40,149 --> 00:37:41,298
But that is his sword

709
00:37:41,584 --> 00:37:42,983
You bastard !

710
00:37:43,152 --> 00:37:44,585
l want to chop you twice

711
00:37:47,523 --> 00:37:48,842
What`s wrong?

712
00:37:48,925 --> 00:37:50,677
Why do you hold the sword?

713
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:51,637
Stay calm

714
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:53,525
Yes! There is conspiracy!

715
00:37:53,963 --> 00:37:54,759
Conspiracy?

716
00:37:55,264 --> 00:37:56,743

We earn our living by
holding swords too

723
00:38:32,135 --> 00:38:33,853
Don`t get angry,
drink some water first

724
00:38:33,903 --> 00:38:34,813
All dead !

725
00:38:38,241 --> 00:38:39,356

00:40:06,896 --> 00:40:08,011
Stop!

732
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,560
Are you kidding?

733
00:40:11,934 --> 00:40:13,492
Why do you always beat me?

734
00:40:13,636 --> 00:40:14,864
Boss

735
00:40:14,904 --> 00:40:17,896
Your feet betrayed you

736
00:40:18,174 --> 00:40:20,244
Don`t you think l am a fool?

737
00:40:23,279 --> 00:40:24,871
Hurry. . .

738
00:40:50,106 --> 00:40:51,221
Watch me!

739
00:40:57,213 --> 00:40:59,044

740
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:06,752
Fat, how are you?

741
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:08,405
Fine!

This magnet is really great

743
00:41:19,669 --> 00:41:20,624
Shit!

744
00:41:20,503 --> 00:41:21,492
Different sex attracts each other

745
00:41:49,532 --> 00:41:50,681
Are you kidding?

746
00:42:35,878 --> 00:42:37,596
Fat, you are really something

747
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,716
Thank you , Your Majesty,

ls there any accident happened to
my son?

756
00:43:23,459 --> 00:43:24,608
Where is my wife!

757
00:43:24,827 --> 00:43:26,545
Search !
Many people are lying on the floor!

758
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:28,098
Cut the crap, kill him

759
00:43:44,647 --> 00:43:45,557
No matter where you are hidding ,
you have to be killed

760
00:44:21,183 --> 00:44:22,298
Kill him

761
00:44:44,006 --> 00:44:45,405
What the hell is it?

762
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:02,461
Kidding?

763
00:45:53,676 --> 00:45:54,347
Hubby

764
00:45:55,277 --> 00:45:56,312

00:46:01,283 --> 00:46:02,079
Honey

767
00:46:03,819 --> 00:46:04,888
Hubby

768
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,959
Where have you been?

769
00:46:13,295 --> 00:46:15,286
l met a friend
who lives in the next village,

770
00:46:15,464 --> 00:46:16,738
There is a crazy sale nearby

771
00:46:16,799 --> 00:46:18,027
so l went for shopping with her

772
00:46:18,968 --> 00:46:19,878

We have had barbecue here

776
00:46:25,808 --> 00:46:27,241
Barbecue?

777
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:28,524
Yes, roast chicken wings

778
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,215
Why do they lie on the floor?

779
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:32,983
They are full ,
it`s nice to have a rest

780
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,701
What`s wrong with you?

781
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,469
You ate with violence, didn`t you?

782
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:38,738
What the hell is it?

783
00:46:38,721 --> 00:46:40,677
All people fought for
one chicken wing !

784
00:46:40,689 --> 00:46:42,327
l fought with all my might,
that`s the result

785
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,031
Don`t you think l am nuts?

786
00:46:51,167 --> 00:46:51,758
You . . .

787
00:46:52,201 --> 00:46:52,997
Honey

788
00:46:54,737 --> 00:46:55,852
You . . .

789
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:02,080
Where do you get this?

790
00:47:03,312 --> 00:47:04,381
This?

791
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,196
lf you like it, just take it

792
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:09,229
l don`t mean it,

793
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:10,479
and l don`t want to
take your advantage

794
00:47:10,553 --> 00:47:11,906
lf l want it,

795
00:47:11,987 --> 00:47:13,215
l`ll ask my husband to buy me one

796
00:47:13,255 --> 00:47:14,370
He is damn rich

797
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:15,738
l want to tell you that,

798
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,349
this doesn`t match you

799
00:47:17,426 --> 00:47:19,064
The color is no good

800
00:47:19,195 --> 00:47:21,026
You have a big belly,

801
00:47:21,063 --> 00:47:23,213
this kind of clothes doesn`t fit you

802
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:26,021
We may have a look in the shops
of the nearby village

803
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,117
Let`s go, let`s have a look

804
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:40,596
My wife

805
00:47:43,852 --> 00:47:44,967
She has fashion sense

806
00:47:46,088 --> 00:47:48,204
Yes, she is nice

807
00:47:50,893 --> 00:47:52,451
Brother Fat

808
00:48:39,008 --> 00:48:40,043
Hubby,

809
00:48:40,142 --> 00:48:41,700

This morning , l saw a fat woman
fall into water ditch

812
00:48:49,118 --> 00:48:53,270
A fat woman fell into water ditch?
What is so funny?

813
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:54,704
Fat woman !

814
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:57,274
Water ditch !

815
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:02,840

Go ahead

819
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:09,349
We have had poor living

820
00:49:10,272 --> 00:49:11,307
Don`t you mind it?

821
00:49:12,007 --> 00:49:13,122
lt depends on you

822

824
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,274
ln all these years,

828
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:26,576
Why don`t you complain against me?

829
00:49:26,722 --> 00:49:27,757
Sure. l have complaints

830
00:49:27,856 --> 00:49:29,574
That super groom

831
00:49:29,625 --> 00:49:31,695
l have to clean the floor
with two legs

832
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,578
My hands are free

833
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:35,153
So, l have to clean the window
with one hand ,

834
00:49:35,197 --> 00:49:36,835
another hand to wash clothes

835
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,650
lt`s so troublesome!

836
00:49:38,801 --> 00:49:40,029
You`ve discovered that!

837
00:49:40,169 --> 00:49:41,568
Yeah . . .

838
00:49:41,537 --> 00:49:43,607
And your air system

839
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:44,761
What`s wrong?

840
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,558
l don`t want to waste time
to complain ,

841
00:49:46,642 --> 00:49:47,757
it drives me crazy

842
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:48,825
Sure it will

843
00:49:48,877 --> 00:49:50,868
What diamond have you hidden?

00:49:50,846 --> 00:49:52,325
Take it out now

Better bath again

You go alone

00:57:28,603 --> 00:57:30,195

Do you want to see her?

They are wishing to see

Line up,

968
00:58:04,372 --> 00:58:06,488
don`t you think a handsome and

969
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,920
smart guy need not line up?

970
00:58:08,143 --> 00:58:09,132
How can you tell l am smart?

and kind-hearted , too!

973

974
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:15,462

This scum doesn`t want to line up!

979
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,195
Miss Gum Tso,

980
00:58:46,047 --> 00:58:47,082
l`ve waited you for ages!

981
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:49,708
Stay calm . . .

982
00:58:50,185 --> 00:58:52,494
Miss Gum Tso wishes to treat you
to a drink

983
00:58:52,687 --> 00:58:54,518
Take a glass over there

984
00:58:57,859 --> 00:58:58,848
This way. . .

985
00:59:02,097 --> 00:59:03,735
Miss Gum Tso, a toast to you

986
00:59:10,272 --> 00:59:11,261
Good wine!

987
00:59:13,241 --> 00:59:15,277
What a nice wine,

988
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:17,002
it makes one lose his mind !

989
00:59:17,379 --> 00:59:20,496
This must be an old wine. . .

990
00:59:20,482 --> 00:59:22,393
. . .of over 1 00 years old

991
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:25,228
l believe that this is tribute
from foreign country

992
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,166
Pal , isn`t it so precious?

993
00:59:27,155 --> 00:59:28,144
Are you exaggerating?

994
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:29,379
You are totally wrong !

995
00:59:29,925 --> 00:59:31,563
You drink it without tasting it

996
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:32,729
Even it isn`t wine,

997
00:59:32,794 --> 00:59:34,386
you can never tell its taste!

998
00:59:34,829 --> 00:59:37,821
Wine is like woman ,
you have to try it by some means

999
00:59:38,967 --> 00:59:40,559
Can anyone lend me his tongue?

1000
00:59:41,303 --> 00:59:42,372
Any longer one?

1001
00:59:43,471 --> 00:59:44,745
Right

1002
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:47,933
The taste buds are on the surface
of our tongues

1003
00:59:48,276 --> 00:59:49,345
Not under

1004
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:52,081
The sweet taste buds are in front

1005
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,272
The bitter taste budsare
near the throat

1006
00:59:56,351 --> 00:59:57,466
Don`t make it too deep

1007
00:59:57,419 --> 00:59:59,011
Alright, l`ll place it in front

1008
00:59:59,487 --> 01:00:02,285
The sour taste bud is on both sides
of the tongue

1009
01:00:02,457 --> 01:00:03,890
So, when we taste good wine,

1010
01:00:03,959 --> 01:00:05,472
roll the tongue,

1011
01:00:08,296 --> 01:00:10,093
you need more practice

1012
01:00:12,968 --> 01:00:15,004
So, you can stop the wine meeting
the sour taste bud

1013
01:00:15,337 --> 01:00:18,135
And let the wine floats between
bitter and sweet taste buds

1014
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,334
Sweet first, and then bitter. . .

1015
01:00:23,011 --> 01:00:24,160
Just like. . .

1016
01:00:26,681 --> 01:00:28,273
the sense of first love

1017
01:00:39,527 --> 01:00:40,755
Congratulation ,

1018
01:00:40,795 --> 01:00:42,945
Gum Tso would like to meet you
in the sitting room

1019
01:00:45,533 --> 01:00:46,602
Miss Gum Tso. . .

1020
01:00:46,501 --> 01:00:47,729
Don`t be anxious

1021
01:00:58,813 --> 01:01:01,247
Why don`t you . . .
you seem to have sore throat

1022
01:01:01,383 --> 01:01:05,581
Are you missing your wife?

1023
01:01:06,488 --> 01:01:10,242
How do you know that?

1024
01:01:10,825 --> 01:01:12,861
Chinese people usually have
early marriage

1025
01:01:13,094 --> 01:01:14,732
You seem to be mature and trustable

1026
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:16,565
l guess, you must have married
for years

1027
01:01:17,365 --> 01:01:18,593
You are flattering me

1028
01:01:18,767 --> 01:01:21,725
You don`t seem to be Chinese

1029
01:01:22,404 --> 01:01:23,393
l come from Gum Kingdom

1030
01:01:23,671 --> 01:01:24,945
You have racial discrimination?

1031
01:01:25,407 --> 01:01:27,284
No way, don`t be silly

1032
01:01:28,943 --> 01:01:30,217
Miss, you seem . . .

1033
01:01:30,879 --> 01:01:31,789
You are fat, and you are thin

1034
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:33,608
You are bored

1035
01:01:34,282 --> 01:01:35,431
Give me a surprise

1036
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:36,819
Do you want any surprise?

1037
01:01:37,218 --> 01:01:38,014
Do you have any?

1038
01:01:38,286 --> 01:01:39,435
Don`t despise me

1039
01:01:40,055 --> 01:01:41,044
Take it out

1040
01:01:41,022 --> 01:01:42,614
Do you want me to take it out?

1041
01:01:42,891 --> 01:01:43,641
Come on

1042
01:01:46,261 --> 01:01:47,296
This is for you

1043
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,292
So pretty! Thank you

1044
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:56,983
You are really different!

1045
01:01:57,138 --> 01:01:59,254
Usually, when the girls see
such precious pearl ,

1046
01:01:59,307 --> 01:02:00,456
either they will scream ,

1047
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:01,577
or, some will die because of
too much excitement

1048
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:03,960
You don`t value material life at all ,

1049
01:02:03,878 --> 01:02:05,027
you are really. . .

1050
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,669
Really different!

1051
01:02:17,826 --> 01:02:20,056
Mister, do you have time to stay?

1052
01:02:20,395 --> 01:02:21,953
To have a long talk?

1053
01:02:23,264 --> 01:02:25,573
My wife has prepared dinner, l don`t
think it`s good for me to stay

1054
01:02:26,201 --> 01:02:27,429
Why do you come then?

1055
01:02:29,504 --> 01:02:33,702
Even cats will be motivated by
such atmosphere!

1056
01:02:34,576 --> 01:02:36,567
Do you know what the cat is talking?

1057
01:02:37,011 --> 01:02:38,239
That cat said ,

1058
01:02:39,114 --> 01:02:41,264
``Don`t bother me, mom will scold me``

1059
01:02:42,016 --> 01:02:43,165
l can`t do that

1060
01:02:43,218 --> 01:02:44,697
l am married , l love my wife

1061
01:02:44,853 --> 01:02:47,242
Although l wish to do it,
l have to control myself

1062
01:02:47,489 --> 01:02:48,478
Control myself

1063
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:49,625
Well , l won`t give it a damn !

1064
01:02:49,491 --> 01:02:50,890
Come on . . .

1065
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:54,795
A good husband is hard to find
in the world

1066
01:02:55,463 --> 01:02:57,181
Since you are thinking of your wife,

1067
01:02:57,532 --> 01:02:58,601
l won`t push you

1068
01:02:59,000 --> 01:02:59,557
Send Mister to the door

1069
01:02:59,667 --> 01:03:00,304
Yes

1070
01:03:01,269 --> 01:03:02,019
Wait. . .

1071
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:03,119
Please leave

1072
01:03:02,971 --> 01:03:04,324
No, l`ve just made up my mind . . .

1073
01:03:04,472 --> 01:03:05,461
Please go back

1074
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:06,972
So bad ! l have halfly undressed !

1075
01:03:07,108 --> 01:03:07,858
Give me a chance!

1076
01:03:07,876 --> 01:03:08,831
Forget it, Mister

1077
01:03:10,178 --> 01:03:12,692
Miss Gum Tso

1078
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:39,274
Hubby,

1079
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:40,673
what`s wrong with you?

1080
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:43,934
l haven`t been that smart

1081
01:03:45,146 --> 01:03:46,659
There isn`t any rice in your bowl

1082
01:03:50,685 --> 01:03:53,358
Hubby, l`ve discovered that,

1083
01:03:53,321 --> 01:03:54,674
the cosmetic you sent me that night,

1084
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,347
doesn`t smell like those. . .

1085
01:03:56,324 --> 01:03:57,882
. . .found from your body

1086
01:03:58,459 --> 01:03:59,892
Didn`t l tell you?

1087
01:04:00,228 --> 01:04:02,298
That`s made by a thing called
Magic Musk

1088
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:05,436
The smell will change according to
different timings

1089
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:07,377
At night, it stinks

1090
01:04:08,836 --> 01:04:10,952
No, it doesn`t stink

1091
01:04:14,342 --> 01:04:15,695
On that day,

1092
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:17,701
you sent me a very big pearl ,

1093
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:19,970
l do want to show off tonight

1094
01:04:19,948 --> 01:04:21,939
But l couldn`t find it out at all

1095
01:04:21,916 --> 01:04:23,429
Do you know where is it?

1096
01:04:23,952 --> 01:04:25,067
This is life

1097
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:26,837
lf you want to find
something anxiously,

1098
01:04:26,788 --> 01:04:27,937
you can never find it

1099
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:29,024
lf you are smart,
you need not find it,

1100
01:04:29,257 --> 01:04:31,373
cause it will show up later

1101
01:04:32,393 --> 01:04:34,907
Father-in-law, have the chicken ass

1102
01:04:35,029 --> 01:04:36,428
Great. . .

1103
01:04:36,464 --> 01:04:37,453
l remember

1104
01:04:37,565 --> 01:04:38,680
Why did you go to
the prostitute house on that day

1105
01:04:39,067 --> 01:04:39,817
Prostitute house?

1106
01:04:39,867 --> 01:04:40,697
Yes, prostitute house

1107
01:04:40,868 --> 01:04:42,062
What did you say?

1108
01:04:42,103 --> 01:04:46,142
l saw him visiting hookers

1109
01:04:54,115 --> 01:04:55,025
Listen to me

1110
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:55,926
Wait

1111
01:04:59,287 --> 01:05:00,402
Don`t lie to me

1112
01:05:00,555 --> 01:05:01,704
l can tell it`s true or not easily

1113
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:11,528
Hooker is woman , she will get sick

1114
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,991
As a gynecologist,

1115
01:05:14,168 --> 01:05:16,204
l went there for treatment

1116
01:05:16,337 --> 01:05:19,727
lt`s nothing weird

1117
01:05:20,141 --> 01:05:22,132
Daughter, is his heart beating fast?

1118
01:05:28,616 --> 01:05:29,492
No

1119
01:05:32,453 --> 01:05:34,011
That`s good

1120
01:05:34,989 --> 01:05:36,058
Sorry, hubby

1121
01:05:40,561 --> 01:05:42,392
You are too bad
for you don`t trust me at all

1122
01:05:43,197 --> 01:05:46,633
Come on , let`s eat. Be happy

1123
01:05:46,768 --> 01:05:48,042
Please help yourself

1124
01:06:22,737 --> 01:06:25,126
lt`s fragrant! Can you smell it?

1125
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:40,671
Miss, who are you looking for?

1126
01:06:41,222 --> 01:06:42,371
l come here to buy herb

1127
01:06:42,724 --> 01:06:44,203
Do you have any chiretta
( means. . .home coming in Chinese )?

1128
01:06:44,659 --> 01:06:45,694
Are you in urgent need?

1129
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:47,009
Come later

1130
01:06:47,762 --> 01:06:48,956
l love a man very much

1131
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:50,324
He hasn`t come to me for many days

1132
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:52,861
l come to buy chiretta
which means home coming in Chinese,

1133
01:06:53,034 --> 01:06:54,592
for l really want him to come back
this night

1134
01:06:57,071 --> 01:06:59,744
Miss, l suggest you to buy ``Tu-wo``
( means living alone )

1135
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:02,670
Living alone, don`t bother others

1136
01:07:03,911 --> 01:07:06,061
You have a kind of special smell ,

1137
01:07:06,114 --> 01:07:07,752
l smelt once!

1138
01:07:07,882 --> 01:07:11,557
Yes, this perfume is called
``Hooking Soul``

1139
01:07:11,886 --> 01:07:13,956
Only l have this kind of
special perfume in town

1140
01:07:15,022 --> 01:07:16,171
lt is an amazing perfume. . .

1141
01:07:16,124 --> 01:07:19,161
. . .to seduce man , right?

1142
01:07:23,898 --> 01:07:25,934
But l can`t hook the man l love

1143
01:07:27,201 --> 01:07:28,680
No matter how hard l torture myself,

1144
01:07:28,803 --> 01:07:31,795
he just brushes me off and comes here
to have dinner with his wife

1145
01:07:32,473 --> 01:07:34,304
So, l come here to see his wife

1146
01:07:39,881 --> 01:07:41,394
Today is my daughter`s birthday

1147
01:07:41,516 --> 01:07:43,074
Don`t mess up here

1148
01:07:45,319 --> 01:07:46,354
You have seen what you want now

1149
01:07:47,088 --> 01:07:48,282
So pretty

1150
01:07:49,257 --> 01:07:50,167
Prettier than you

1151
01:07:50,992 --> 01:07:51,742
Send her to the door

1152
01:07:51,993 --> 01:07:53,062
Madam

1153
01:07:54,128 --> 01:07:55,447
Today is your birthday!

1154
01:07:55,963 --> 01:07:57,191
l haven`t any present

1155
01:07:57,632 --> 01:08:00,192
But, why not take this little thing
as my present?

1156
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:13,358
Are you kidding?

1157
01:08:13,815 --> 01:08:15,089
Right,

1158
01:08:15,116 --> 01:08:16,151
when you don`t want to find it,

1159
01:08:16,017 --> 01:08:17,291
it will show up itself

1160
01:08:18,853 --> 01:08:21,492
Are you kidding?
You sent it to her?

1161
01:08:22,156 --> 01:08:23,350
This is your present to me,

1162
01:08:23,791 --> 01:08:25,270
how l can send it to others?

1163
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:26,875
What is your relationship?

1164
01:08:27,028 --> 01:08:28,143
Tell me

1165
01:08:30,097 --> 01:08:33,294
By the way, it seems to be clear!

1166
01:08:33,835 --> 01:08:35,154
You bastard !

1167
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:37,988
How can you treat my daughter
like this? Are you a man?

1168
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,193
Granny, don`t be angry

1169
01:08:40,308 --> 01:08:41,343
Give me back the pearl

1170
01:08:41,943 --> 01:08:43,137
Madam , don`t be excited !

1171
01:08:47,448 --> 01:08:49,325
You bitch , l wanna kill you !

1172
01:08:53,454 --> 01:08:54,603
No

1173
01:08:54,889 --> 01:08:56,322
lf you hurt her, l will kill you

1174
01:08:57,992 --> 01:08:58,981
lf you hurt me, l will kill him

1175
01:08:59,293 --> 01:09:00,772
None of my business, lady!

1176
01:09:01,128 --> 01:09:02,277
Stop her now

1177
01:09:06,367 --> 01:09:07,356
Bitch !

1178
01:09:12,707 --> 01:09:13,935
Drop the horse down

1179
01:09:14,575 --> 01:09:15,485
What did you say, honey?

1180
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:18,268
You scared my friend

1181
01:09:18,412 --> 01:09:20,368
Drop the horse

1182
01:09:22,083 --> 01:09:23,277
You lied

1183
01:09:23,985 --> 01:09:25,623
You said you would love me forever

1184
01:09:25,853 --> 01:09:27,047
You lied too

1185
01:09:27,088 --> 01:09:29,283
You said
you were born in the year of rabbit,

1186
01:09:29,423 --> 01:09:30,697
but you were born in the year
of tiger, you are older than me

1187
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:35,380
You lied , you lied !

1188
01:09:35,963 --> 01:09:37,112
Drop the horse

1189
01:09:37,398 --> 01:09:38,467
Don`t throw me
while l am not paying attention

1190
01:09:38,666 --> 01:09:39,735
l can tell your trick

1191
01:09:47,608 --> 01:09:48,836
Drop it, now!

1192
01:09:51,345 --> 01:09:52,016
Are you alright?

1193
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:53,261
l am fine

1194
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:55,430
Sorry to ruin your party

1195
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:57,103
All because
l wish to see you very much

1196
01:09:57,418 --> 01:09:59,295
l am too bad , l am leaving

1197
01:10:00,121 --> 01:10:01,270
l will go with you

1198
01:10:01,455 --> 01:10:03,013
lt`s nonsense for me to stay in
such nonsense family

1199
01:10:03,391 --> 01:10:04,062
Go

1200
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:06,948
Hubby

1201
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:11,580
Are you hungry?

1202
01:10:11,465 --> 01:10:12,614
Let me cook noodle for you

1203
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:23,314
Wait

1204
01:10:32,053 --> 01:10:33,452
What a shame!

1205
01:10:33,421 --> 01:10:35,696
Don`t get angry,
let`s go back to my place

1206
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:36,527
l will do that with you

1207
01:10:36,958 --> 01:10:37,947
That?

1208
01:10:37,858 --> 01:10:38,927
That`s what you want

1209
01:10:40,861 --> 01:10:42,579
You are inhumane!

1210
01:10:45,066 --> 01:10:47,216
Oh my God !

1211
01:11:17,465 --> 01:11:19,615
We have become a couple at last

1212
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:21,386
On this stormy night,

1213
01:11:21,636 --> 01:11:22,955
we will enjoy ourselves!

1214
01:11:24,038 --> 01:11:25,551
You look cheap

1215
01:11:25,673 --> 01:11:27,072
You haven`t seen my cheaper look

1216
01:11:27,341 --> 01:11:28,820
Alright, listen to me

1217
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:30,706
l have had hard feeling

1218
01:11:30,878 --> 01:11:32,436
Your wife felt so sad

1219
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:34,329
For you , l can sacrifice my wife

1220
01:11:34,548 --> 01:11:35,663
as well as my life

1221
01:11:35,716 --> 01:11:36,785
Don`t say anything nonsense

1222
01:11:37,418 --> 01:11:38,692
l don`t want. . .

1223
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:41,336
. . .to cheat you ,

1224
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:42,244
l am a Forbidden City Cop,

1225
01:11:42,323 --> 01:11:44,154
my duty is to protect His Majesty

1226
01:11:44,659 --> 01:11:47,014
l came here for
His Majesty is fond of you

1227
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:48,330
He wants me to check you

1228
01:11:49,196 --> 01:11:51,756
You don`t check me,

1229
01:11:51,866 --> 01:11:52,981
you just want to screw me

1230
01:11:52,933 --> 01:11:54,810
You are betraying His Majesty

1231
01:11:54,969 --> 01:11:56,322
But l can`t help loving you

1232
01:11:56,737 --> 01:11:58,011
Forget about him !

1233
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:00,262
Ling Ling Fat!

1234
01:12:07,548 --> 01:12:08,537
Your Majesty

1235
01:12:08,649 --> 01:12:09,923
Luckily you have come on time

1236
01:12:11,719 --> 01:12:13,437
Did you hear everything?

1237
01:12:13,854 --> 01:12:14,969
You !

1238
01:12:14,855 --> 01:12:15,810
lf she didn`t write. . .

1239
01:12:15,756 --> 01:12:17,109
. . .to His Majesty,

1240
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:19,080
we wouldn`t have known that

1241
01:12:19,093 --> 01:12:21,243
you betrayed His Majesty

1242
01:12:21,395 --> 01:12:22,544
You . . .

1243
01:12:22,763 --> 01:12:24,082
ln order to. . .

1244
01:12:24,265 --> 01:12:25,664
. . .trap him ,

1245
01:12:26,567 --> 01:12:28,842
l don`t mind risking my virginity

1246
01:12:30,171 --> 01:12:32,924
Your Majesty, if you come a bit late,

1247
01:12:34,075 --> 01:12:35,508
l don`t know what will happen !

1248
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:37,923
You . . .

1249
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:39,294
Ling Ling Fat,

1250
01:12:39,346 --> 01:12:41,621
your family will have
capital punishment, you know?

1251
01:12:41,782 --> 01:12:42,453
Your Majesty

1252
01:12:43,084 --> 01:12:44,073
Catch him

1253
01:12:56,263 --> 01:12:57,821
Your Majesty, why do you cuff me?

1254
01:12:58,966 --> 01:13:00,285
Your trap. . .

1255
01:13:00,401 --> 01:13:01,754
. . .is really great!

1256
01:13:02,203 --> 01:13:04,797
You want me to break my family

1257
01:13:05,573 --> 01:13:07,882
Then you make His Majesty kill me

1258
01:13:08,409 --> 01:13:11,526
You will kidnap him to blackmail
the government

1259
01:13:11,812 --> 01:13:12,927
Then your troop will move. . .

1260
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:14,618
. . .from the North to take over
our country

1261
01:13:14,715 --> 01:13:16,114
lt seem to be a piece of cake

1262
01:13:16,283 --> 01:13:17,272
Damn !

1263
01:13:17,651 --> 01:13:18,766
But, you remember the pearl which
fancies all women in the world?

1264
01:13:18,819 --> 01:13:20,013
When you received . . .

1265
01:13:20,121 --> 01:13:21,440
. . .that pearl ,

1266
01:13:21,555 --> 01:13:23,193
you didn`t feel excited ,

1267
01:13:23,424 --> 01:13:24,254
that`s why l know,

1268
01:13:24,291 --> 01:13:26,282
you are not a woman

1269
01:13:27,094 --> 01:13:29,892
Who is my foe?

1270
01:13:29,930 --> 01:13:31,204
And who will undergo
such fantastic plastic surgery?

1271
01:13:31,298 --> 01:13:33,573
Only a faceless old folk will do it

1272
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,859
King of no face, you bastard !

1273
01:13:35,903 --> 01:13:37,700
l hate others to cheat me
by pretending as woman !

1274
01:13:37,671 --> 01:13:38,899
Especially disguising as
such pretty woman to seduce me!

1275
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:41,075
Luckily Fat is so smart!

1276
01:13:41,275 --> 01:13:42,151
He disclosed your secret

1277
01:13:42,276 --> 01:13:42,992
Your Majesty

1278
01:13:42,943 --> 01:13:43,853
Don`t move

1279
01:13:43,844 --> 01:13:44,993
Don`t trust him !

1280
01:13:45,045 --> 01:13:46,717
He wanted to screw me
so he brushed his wife off,

1281
01:13:46,781 --> 01:13:49,136
and he even beated his wife up
in front of me

1282
01:13:49,483 --> 01:13:50,632
He isn`t a man at all

1283
01:13:51,118 --> 01:13:52,437
ln order to trap you ,

1284
01:13:52,586 --> 01:13:55,305
my family performed a show
in front of you

1285
01:13:55,856 --> 01:13:56,606
Dear audience

1286
01:13:57,424 --> 01:13:58,573
The best actress

1287
01:14:08,402 --> 01:14:09,357
ln this play,

1288
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:10,498
she acted . . .

1289
01:14:10,538 --> 01:14:12,256
. . .very well that,

1290
01:14:12,206 --> 01:14:13,321
no matter. . .

1291
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:14,534
judging from her eyes,

1292
01:14:14,675 --> 01:14:16,267
or movement,

1293
01:14:16,277 --> 01:14:17,596
she could express

1294
01:14:17,711 --> 01:14:18,939
how a sad wife feels

1295
01:14:19,313 --> 01:14:21,224
Especially when she threw the horse,

1296
01:14:21,215 --> 01:14:23,171
it shows a strong protest originated

1297
01:14:23,184 --> 01:14:25,140
from post modernism

1298
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:26,969
Let us see. . .

1299
01:14:27,054 --> 01:14:27,964
how she threw the horse again

1300
01:14:27,888 --> 01:14:29,037
Watch ! Watch !

1301
01:14:31,792 --> 01:14:33,066
Mrs. Fat, congratulation . . .

1302
01:14:33,194 --> 01:14:34,388
Thank you

1303
01:14:36,463 --> 01:14:38,931
First of all ,
l have to thank my parents

1304
01:14:38,999 --> 01:14:40,990
Since they`ve been supporting me

1305
01:14:41,068 --> 01:14:43,263
And l have to thank my husband

1306
01:14:43,871 --> 01:14:46,021
He gave me chance to act

1307
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,431
We had rehearsed many many times

1308
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:50,956
So, this award is yours too

1309
01:14:51,212 --> 01:14:52,486
Hubby, thank you

1310
01:14:54,648 --> 01:14:57,685
Alright, let`s present
the final award of this night

1311
01:14:57,818 --> 01:15:00,207
l believe that, you can guess it

1312
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:03,404
The best actor is Ah Fat. . .

1313
01:15:03,257 --> 01:15:03,894
Ah Fat`s father-in-law

1314
01:15:04,558 --> 01:15:07,118
Wonderful !

1315
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:16,004
This award should go to me

1316
01:15:16,837 --> 01:15:19,271
l did see him visiting
the prostitute house!

1317
01:15:19,874 --> 01:15:20,784
Wait

1318
01:15:20,708 --> 01:15:22,061
l am sorry

1319
01:15:22,076 --> 01:15:23,111
l am the leading man !

1320
01:15:23,210 --> 01:15:25,360
You can tell l have done a great job

1321
01:15:25,346 --> 01:15:26,335
Why do you present the award to him?

1322
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,869
Your acting is quite good ,
but not mature

1323
01:15:28,983 --> 01:15:31,133
Say, when your wife heard
your heart beat,

1324
01:15:31,452 --> 01:15:34,046
your expression was a bit exaggerated

1325
01:15:34,121 --> 01:15:36,271
That`s the point of view
of ordinary audiences!

1326
01:15:36,423 --> 01:15:38,175
You won`t be that ignorant?

1327
01:15:38,325 --> 01:15:40,361
No, when l heard your heart beat,

1328
01:15:40,527 --> 01:15:43,121
l couldn`t feel any response from you

1329
01:15:43,197 --> 01:15:45,427
l felt that,
you couldn`t concentrate in acting

1330
01:15:45,633 --> 01:15:47,112
You didn`t act well indeed

1331
01:15:47,201 --> 01:15:48,350
You . . .

1332
01:15:48,569 --> 01:15:49,684
Be fair

1333
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:50,898
Just one word

1334
01:15:51,071 --> 01:15:53,187
You don`t know acting

1335
01:15:53,307 --> 01:15:55,741
Shut up! Gum Tso`s sex is still
a doubtful question

1336
01:15:55,776 --> 01:15:57,050
How can you . . .

1337
01:15:57,144 --> 01:15:58,213
. . .present awards here?

1338
01:15:58,345 --> 01:15:59,494
lt`s a mess

1339
01:15:59,747 --> 01:16:02,580
l am a person
who is willing to die for you

1340
01:16:02,783 --> 01:16:05,775
Let me use my body,

1341
01:16:05,753 --> 01:16:07,709
to check whether
Gum Tso is a woman or not

1342
01:16:07,788 --> 01:16:08,903
Be careful !

1343
01:16:27,541 --> 01:16:29,372
Ling Ling Fat, you killed my son

1344
01:16:29,443 --> 01:16:31,115
Even l can`t kill your family,

1345
01:16:31,178 --> 01:16:33,214
l want to kill you too

1346
01:16:33,614 --> 01:16:34,649
Neither of you can go

1347
01:16:34,915 --> 01:16:36,234
Protect His Majesty

1348
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:37,239
Fat-yan ,
take the Box of Treasure to me

1349
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,994
Catch it

1350
01:16:46,794 --> 01:16:48,022
Are you kidding?

1351
01:16:48,062 --> 01:16:49,051
Why did you ask me
to throw it to you?

1352
01:16:49,330 --> 01:16:50,285
Game over!

1353
01:16:50,597 --> 01:16:51,825
l am sorry

1354
01:16:55,369 --> 01:16:56,722
lt doesn`t hurt!

1355
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:00,934
But the one next to you is
in bad luck

1356
01:17:01,275 --> 01:17:02,549
That`s No-face Stance

1357
01:17:02,676 --> 01:17:05,793
lt can transfer energy

1358
01:17:20,361 --> 01:17:21,396
Pal , are you alright?

1359
01:17:21,795 --> 01:17:22,864
l am scared

1360
01:17:23,731 --> 01:17:24,880
But l am fine

1361
01:17:25,099 --> 01:17:26,612
l feel comfortable

1362
01:17:26,967 --> 01:17:28,082
lt`s not painful at all

1363
01:17:28,268 --> 01:17:29,178
So, l won`t give it a damn

1364
01:17:29,236 --> 01:17:30,305
Let me do it

1365
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:40,205
Pal , didn`t you say comfortable?

1366
01:17:40,547 --> 01:17:42,105
lt`s really comfortable

1367
01:17:42,449 --> 01:17:43,598
Forget it

1368
01:17:43,550 --> 01:17:45,780
You`d better beat that guy

1369
01:17:51,225 --> 01:17:52,260
l have to think something else

1370
01:17:53,427 --> 01:17:56,385
Forget it, please hit me

1371
01:18:03,771 --> 01:18:05,250
lt`s not predictable

1372
01:18:10,711 --> 01:18:12,861
No color, no face,

1373
01:18:12,846 --> 01:18:15,485
long life to stay!

1374
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:17,765
l`m the supreme of the world !

1375
01:18:35,335 --> 01:18:36,131
Who is it?

1376
01:18:36,370 --> 01:18:37,519
My dear sister

1377
01:18:37,704 --> 01:18:38,500
We all rely on you !

1378
01:18:40,607 --> 01:18:42,677
Soul Changing Stance

1379
01:19:06,166 --> 01:19:08,316
l feel dizzy,
l can`t stand it anymore

1380
01:19:09,636 --> 01:19:11,866
lt`s cheap!
Who do you want to scare?

1381
01:19:15,275 --> 01:19:16,344
Don`t you think such chain . . .

1382
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:17,359
. . .can lock me up?

1383
01:19:18,412 --> 01:19:20,164
lt`s not for locking you ,

1384
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:22,250
it`s used to connect
the lightning-rod

1385
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:23,865
You said ,

1386
01:19:24,017 --> 01:19:25,370
we will enjoy ourselves
on a stormy night

1387
01:19:25,819 --> 01:19:28,379
l`ll let you try
a wonderful thunder storm

1388
01:20:46,433 --> 01:20:46,990
Don`t move!

1389
01:21:08,956 --> 01:21:09,513
Fly. . .

1390
01:21:11,892 --> 01:21:12,483
Flying . . .

1391
01:21:14,695 --> 01:21:15,286
Fa. . .

1392
01:21:18,699 --> 01:21:19,609
Fairy

1393
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:18,649
1 , 2 , 3, 4 5

1394
01:22:19,293 --> 01:22:21,409
lt`s right here

1395
01:22:48,722 --> 01:22:51,680
The thunder hit Fat

1396
01:22:51,692 --> 01:22:54,570
So it transform his cells

1397
01:22:54,594 --> 01:22:57,586
During the process,
he gained extra power

1398
01:22:57,931 --> 01:23:00,650
So, he can release
the power of Flying Fairy

1399
01:23:01,368 --> 01:23:02,926
At that moment,

1400
01:23:03,003 --> 01:23:04,994
it seems that
there was a flying fairy in the sky

1401
01:23:05,572 --> 01:23:08,609
lsn`t it illusion caused by
air crash ,

1402
01:23:08,575 --> 01:23:10,725
or am l drunk?

1403
01:23:10,777 --> 01:23:12,847
Of course you are drunk

1404
01:23:13,747 --> 01:23:14,941
So, you have drunk much more than me

1405
01:23:15,415 --> 01:23:16,973
l am drunk everyday

1406
01:23:17,718 --> 01:23:19,117
lt`s strange,

1407
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:20,313
why hasn`t Fat come to work?

1408
01:23:20,887 --> 01:23:23,447
Brother Fat, where are you?

1409
01:23:23,990 --> 01:23:25,218
We can`t live without you

1410
01:23:25,592 --> 01:23:26,911
Brother Fat, where are you?

1411
01:23:27,928 --> 01:23:29,156
Hubby, it`s so great!

1412
01:23:30,230 --> 01:23:32,380
Your new invention

1413
01:23:32,466 --> 01:23:34,457
let us fly freely in the sky

1414
01:23:34,634 --> 01:23:36,306
Let us name it. . .

1415
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:37,485
Helicopter, isn`t it nice?

1416
01:23:37,537 --> 01:23:39,095
No, this isn`t a good name

1417
01:23:39,172 --> 01:23:40,207
Why not name it. . .

1418
01:23:40,273 --> 01:23:42,025
Air air air air air O Plane?

1419
01:23:42,242 --> 01:23:43,561
You are so smart, honey

1420
01:23:43,677 --> 01:23:45,554
lf not, how can l be your honey?

1421
01:23:46,246 --> 01:23:47,395
Hubby, let`s fly again

1422
01:23:50,817 --> 01:23:52,853
So romantic!

1423
01:23:53,587 --> 01:23:54,656
Hubby,

1424
01:23:54,554 --> 01:23:57,022
l want to have a baby with you

1425
01:23:57,090 --> 01:24:01,402
Alright, let`s go home and make love

1426
01:24:01,695 --> 01:24:02,844
No way, l can`t wait

1427
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:05,066
Let`s do it here!
