1
00:00:33,838 --> 00:00:38,740
Never thought that
l'd be fighting you

2
00:00:38,942 --> 00:00:43,106
But you stole my heart
you cheated and lied

3
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:49,618
you Weren't in my corner
you Weren't on my side

4
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,219
The gloves are off
you hit below the belt

5
00:00:55,192 --> 00:01:00,859
Now it's time-out, baby
And they've rung the bell

6
00:01:01,265 --> 00:01:03,664
l'm not a fighter
l'm a lover

7
00:01:03,868 --> 00:01:06,665
But if you run
Then run for cover

8
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,840
Fight for your love
yeah

9
00:01:17,614 --> 00:01:21,881
When it's round two, girl
Turn this up! Now!

10
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:24,076
Good.
l get a knockout punch

11
00:01:24,287 --> 00:01:27,257
With this heartfelt song

12
00:01:28,426 --> 00:01:31,953
l know when l count you
Down from ten

13
00:01:33,798 --> 00:01:38,167
l'll find you
ln my loving arms again

14
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:44,004
The gloves are off
you hit below the belt

15
00:01:44,207 --> 00:01:49,338
Now it's time-out, baby
And they've rung the bell

16
00:01:50,548 --> 00:01:52,846
l'm not a fighter
l'm a lover

17
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:55,712
But if you run
Then run for cover

18
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,650
Fight for your love
yeah

19
00:02:23,948 --> 00:02:25,609
l'm not a fighter
l'm a lover

20
00:02:25,817 --> 00:02:28,546
But if you run
Then run for cover

21
00:02:28,752 --> 00:02:31,847
Fight for your love
yeah

22
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:46,168
Whoa, nobody caught me.
That was lame.

23
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,429
l don't think he's moving.

24
00:02:58,415 --> 00:03:00,145
He is a lazy freeloader,

25
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,979
and it's time for all this
dysfunction to stop.

26
00:03:03,187 --> 00:03:05,382
Can't We just do this later?

27
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,150
l mean, you know how
he gets in the morning.

28
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:12,489
Ned, aren't you tired of letting people
push you around?

29
00:03:12,697 --> 00:03:14,425
Yes.

30
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:17,829
Then get in there and do it.

31
00:03:21,271 --> 00:03:22,739
What?

32
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:24,168
What is it?

33
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:28,538
Dewey, hey,
it's the first of the month, and...

34
00:03:28,746 --> 00:03:30,907
...l'd like your share
of the rent now.

35
00:03:31,115 --> 00:03:32,843
Man, you know l don't have it.

36
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,644
You wake me up for that?
Come on, man!

37
00:03:35,853 --> 00:03:37,912
Sorry.

38
00:03:41,324 --> 00:03:44,384
Dewey, l mean, you owe me
a lot of money as it is.

39
00:03:44,594 --> 00:03:46,324
Yeah, try $2,200.

40
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,661
Ok, you guys,
the band is about to hit it bigtime.

41
00:03:51,868 --> 00:03:55,326
We'll win Battle of the Bands.
When l'm rolling in Benjamins,

42
00:03:55,538 --> 00:03:58,302
l Will throw you and your dog a bone.
Good night.

43
00:03:58,508 --> 00:04:02,240
Your band has never made 2 cents.
Patty, come on, l'm on this.

44
00:04:02,445 --> 00:04:04,538
Oh, you're on this?
You're on this?

45
00:04:04,748 --> 00:04:06,272
He's Walking all over you.

46
00:04:06,484 --> 00:04:09,008
Mommy, could we please
talk about this later?

47
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:12,848
No, We can't talk about it later,
because we have to go to work.

48
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:16,355
We have jobs.
We contribute to society. All right?

49
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,757
l am an assistant to
the mayor of the city, ''hello''!

50
00:04:19,963 --> 00:04:23,524
What? Can you get her out of here,
please? Why? Why her?

51
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:26,430
And Ned has the most
important job there is.

52
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,399
Temping?

53
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:31,005
Dewey, a substitute teacher
is not a temp.

54
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,574
He's a babysitter.
Think it's so easy?

55
00:04:33,778 --> 00:04:36,541
l'd like to see you try.
You Wouldn't last a day.

56
00:04:36,747 --> 00:04:38,805
Dude, l service society
by rocking.

57
00:04:39,016 --> 00:04:41,610
l'm out there liberating people
With my music.

58
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:44,343
Rocking ain't no
Walk in the park, lady.

59
00:04:44,555 --> 00:04:46,648
All right, this is useless,
all right?

60
00:04:46,857 --> 00:04:50,759
Tell him if he doesn't come up
With the rent by the end of the Week,

61
00:04:50,961 --> 00:04:52,189
he's out of here.

62
00:04:52,396 --> 00:04:55,456
Dewey, l'm not paying
your share of the rent, so...

63
00:04:55,665 --> 00:04:58,964
...maybe you should sell
one of your guitars or something.

64
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,569
What?

65
00:05:00,771 --> 00:05:03,399
Would you tell Picasso
to sell his guitars?

66
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,742
Oh, my God. He's an idiot.

67
00:05:08,812 --> 00:05:12,249
Dude, l've been mooching off you
for years,

68
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:15,680
and it was never a problem until
she showed up. Dump her.

69
00:05:15,886 --> 00:05:18,855
lf you don't come up with
some money, she'll dump me.

70
00:05:19,055 --> 00:05:21,649
Really? That would be good.
She's a nightmare.

71
00:05:21,858 --> 00:05:24,418
Come on. l may never have
another girlfriend.

72
00:05:24,627 --> 00:05:27,755
l mean, just come on.
Come up with some money, please.

73
00:05:27,964 --> 00:05:29,192
Please.

74
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:32,528
Ok. For you. Not for her, man.
For you.

75
00:05:33,471 --> 00:05:34,733
Thank you.

76
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:36,802
Heal me

77
00:05:37,007 --> 00:05:39,033
l'm heartsick
D minor.

78
00:05:39,242 --> 00:05:44,408
l'm hungry
And A minor, G, on you

79
00:05:44,615 --> 00:05:46,742
Heal my heart
Hey! What's up?

80
00:05:46,951 --> 00:05:49,180
ls that a new song?
Who's this guy?

81
00:05:49,387 --> 00:05:52,617
We're taking the Battle of the Bands
seriously this year.

82
00:05:52,822 --> 00:05:55,451
Good, because l need
the money. Now, listen.

83
00:05:55,658 --> 00:05:59,992
lf We're gonna win this thing, We gotta
actually start playing some music.

84
00:06:00,197 --> 00:06:01,788
l agree. You're fired.

85
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:05,627
Your lyrics, now don't take this
the wrong way, Theo, are lame.

86
00:06:05,836 --> 00:06:09,396
But l've been sitting on some
awesome material, so...

87
00:06:09,607 --> 00:06:11,403
Did you hear What l said?

88
00:06:11,608 --> 00:06:12,906
We voted.

89
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,668
You're out.

90
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,108
This is Spider. He's replacing you.

91
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:19,076
What's up, dog?

92
00:06:21,317 --> 00:06:24,583
l was gonna tell you last night,
but you passed out, man.

93
00:06:24,788 --> 00:06:28,156
You're gonna kick me out of the band?
You're gonna fire me?

94
00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:31,817
lt's my band. l brought us together.
Theo wanted you out.

95
00:06:32,028 --> 00:06:36,398
There's nothing l could do.
Shut up, man. You voted him out too.

96
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,295
Dewey, listen to me.

97
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:40,293
You're a good guitar player,

98
00:06:40,504 --> 00:06:45,531
but it's the 20-minute solos.
lt's the stage dives.

99
00:06:45,742 --> 00:06:50,202
We're trying to land a record deal here,
man, and you're an embarrassment.

100
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,672
Read between the lines, Theo.

101
00:06:52,882 --> 00:06:55,283
Read between the lines!

102
00:06:55,485 --> 00:06:58,283
Dewey, man, l hope
this doesn't come between us.

103
00:06:58,488 --> 00:07:00,286
Like, l care about you, man.

104
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,687
You guys, you know what?
You're nuts. You're all nuts.

105
00:07:03,894 --> 00:07:06,192
You've been focused
so hard on making it,

106
00:07:06,396 --> 00:07:09,331
you forgot about one thing.
lt's called the music.

107
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:12,127
And l don't even care.
You know what? So what.

108
00:07:12,336 --> 00:07:15,430
l don't wanna hang out with
wannabe corporate sellouts.

109
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:19,005
l'm gonna form my own band.
We're gonna start a revolution.

110
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:23,475
And you're gonna be a funny
little footnote on my epic ass.

111
00:07:32,456 --> 00:07:34,788
l feel sorry for you guys.

112
00:07:40,697 --> 00:07:42,062
Yes.

113
00:07:42,266 --> 00:07:47,168
Yeah, it's a 1968 Gibson SG,
mint condish.

114
00:07:48,605 --> 00:07:49,834
No.

115
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,634
That's all?
Well, that's a mistake.

116
00:07:52,843 --> 00:07:55,504
No, Hendrix played this guitar.

117
00:07:55,713 --> 00:07:57,475
Hello?

118
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:08,420
Yeah?
ls this Mr. Schneebly?

119
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:09,923
No, he's not here.

120
00:08:10,127 --> 00:08:13,824
Could you take a message for me?
Yeah.

121
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:16,089
Hi. My name's Rosalie Mullins.

122
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,430
l'm the principal at Horace Green Prep.
We're having a little emergency.

123
00:08:20,637 --> 00:08:23,697
One of our teachers broke
her leg this morning,

124
00:08:23,908 --> 00:08:26,172
and all of our subs
are already working.

125
00:08:26,377 --> 00:08:30,473
Pat Wickam at Milton Prep
recommended l call Mr. Schneebly.

126
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,443
Do you know if he's available?

127
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:36,751
How long is the gig?
Excuse me?

128
00:08:36,953 --> 00:08:39,081
How long is the job?

129
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:41,019
As much as a few weeks,

130
00:08:41,225 --> 00:08:43,557
but we need somebody
to start immediately.

131
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,453
So how much are we talking here?

132
00:08:47,498 --> 00:08:50,227
We pay our substitutes
650 a Week.

133
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:53,596
Now, do you know when
Mr. Schneebly will be back?

134
00:08:53,803 --> 00:08:56,033
Hold on a sec.
Oh, you know what?

135
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,437
l think he's just coming in right...
Ned, phone!

136
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:09,451
Hello, this is Ned Schneebly.

137
00:09:20,697 --> 00:09:24,134
Pat faxed me your rèsumè.
lt's very impressive.

138
00:09:24,335 --> 00:09:28,066
We've never been in a bind like this
before, so thank you so much.

139
00:09:28,272 --> 00:09:31,605
So how's this gonna work?
Are you gonna pay me upfront?

140
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:33,139
l don't understand.

141
00:09:33,344 --> 00:09:36,107
lt'd be really great
if l could get paid in cash.

142
00:09:36,312 --> 00:09:38,371
Oh, Well, We don't do that.

143
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:42,575
When you cut my check, make it
payable to Dewey Finn, for tax reasons.

144
00:09:42,785 --> 00:09:46,414
You can discuss all of that
with Candace at the end of the day.

145
00:09:46,624 --> 00:09:48,091
When's the end of the day?

146
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:51,317
We commence at 8:15,
school lets out at 3.

147
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:54,028
You know what?

148
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,759
Do you think l could cut out a little
early today? l got some stuff l gotta do.

149
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:02,434
lt's cool. l can stay.

150
00:10:03,573 --> 00:10:05,438
Mr. Schneebly...

151
00:10:05,643 --> 00:10:09,169
...this is considered the best
elementary school in the state,

152
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:12,837
and We maintain that by adhering
to a strict code of conduct,

153
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:14,517
faculty included.

154
00:10:14,717 --> 00:10:17,015
Don't worry about me.
l'm a hard-ass.

155
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:20,519
lf a kid gets out of line, l got
no problem smacking him.

156
00:10:21,658 --> 00:10:24,355
No, no. We don't use
corporal punishment here.

157
00:10:24,561 --> 00:10:26,995
Ok, so just verbal abuse?

158
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:31,701
lf you have any problems with
any students, send them to me.

159
00:10:31,902 --> 00:10:34,096

00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:40,976
Children.

00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:44,504
Please take your seats.

162
00:10:45,682 --> 00:10:48,480
l'd like to introduce
Miss Dunham's substitute.

163
00:10:48,686 --> 00:10:50,950
This is Mr. Schneebly.

164
00:10:52,423 --> 00:10:55,051
Why don't you write
your name on the board.

165
00:10:55,525 --> 00:10:57,356
Yes, l will.

166
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:10,197
You know what?
Why don't you all just call me ''Mr. S''.

167
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:15,404
Mr. S has never taught here
at Horace Green,

168
00:11:15,611 --> 00:11:18,774
so l Want you all to be
on your best behavior.

169
00:11:19,383 --> 00:11:21,749
So the curriculum
is on the desk.

170
00:11:21,951 --> 00:11:25,388
And do you have any questions?
Yeah, When's lunch?

171
00:11:27,256 --> 00:11:29,451
The children just had their lunch.

172
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:31,855
ls there anything else you need?

173
00:11:33,596 --> 00:11:37,363
l'm a teacher.
All l need are minds for molding.

174
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:40,969
All right, then. Well, thanks again.
You saved the day.

175
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:52,014
Ok, Who's got food in here?

176
00:11:54,217 --> 00:11:56,947
You're not gonna get in trouble.
l'm hungry.

177
00:12:00,823 --> 00:12:03,258
You. What do you got?

178
00:12:08,331 --> 00:12:10,265
That's What l'm talking about.

179
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:18,139
Ok. Teach. Teach. Teach.

180
00:12:18,341 --> 00:12:21,470
All right, look, here's the deal.

181
00:12:21,677 --> 00:12:25,135
l've got a hangover.
Who knoWs What that means?

182
00:12:25,349 --> 00:12:30,081
Doesn't that mean you're drunk?
No. lt means l Was drunk yesterday.

183
00:12:30,287 --> 00:12:33,687
lt means you're an alcoholic.
Wrong.

184
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,826
You Wouldn't come to Work
hung-over unless you Were.

185
00:12:37,027 --> 00:12:39,427
Dude, you got a disease.

186
00:12:40,596 --> 00:12:42,860
What's your name?
Freddy Jones.

187
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:44,828
Freddy Jones, shut up.

188
00:12:45,836 --> 00:12:47,496
Shut up.

189
00:12:48,038 --> 00:12:50,562
The point is,
you all can just chill today.

190
00:12:50,774 --> 00:12:54,471
We'll start on
this crapola tomorroW.

191
00:12:55,178 --> 00:12:58,148
Yes, Tinkerbell?
Summer.

192
00:12:58,347 --> 00:13:02,546
As class factotum, first l'd like to
just say, Welcome to Horace Green.

193
00:13:02,753 --> 00:13:05,448
Thank you.
Any questions about our schedule?

194
00:13:05,655 --> 00:13:08,523
Because usually noW
Miss Dunham teaches vocabulary,

195
00:13:08,725 --> 00:13:12,354
then gives us a pop quiz, then
splits us up into reading groups.

196
00:13:12,562 --> 00:13:14,724
Track B is...
Ok, hey, hey, hey.

197
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:18,265
Miss ''Dumbum''
ain't your teacher today, l am.

198
00:13:18,469 --> 00:13:20,437
And l got a headache
and the runs.

199
00:13:20,636 --> 00:13:22,696
So l say, time for recess.

200
00:13:22,905 --> 00:13:26,865
But Mr. S, that poster charts
everyone's performance.

201
00:13:27,076 --> 00:13:29,909
We get stars When We master
the material covered.

202
00:13:30,113 --> 00:13:32,876
HoW do We get gold stars
if We just have recess?

203
00:13:33,317 --> 00:13:36,844
What are these black dots here?
Demerits.

204
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:43,682
What kind of a sick school is this?

205
00:13:54,804 --> 00:14:00,606
As long as l'm here, there Will be
no grades or gold stars or demerits.

206
00:14:00,811 --> 00:14:03,041
We're gonna have recess
all the time.

207
00:14:03,246 --> 00:14:06,273
But Miss Dunham only gives us
recess for 1 5 minutes...

208
00:14:06,482 --> 00:14:10,681
You're not hearing me, girl.
l'm in charge noW, Ok?

209
00:14:11,355 --> 00:14:13,619
And l say recess.

210
00:14:14,224 --> 00:14:17,091
Go. Play and have fun, noW.

211
00:14:17,293 --> 00:14:18,760
Nice.

212
00:14:20,297 --> 00:14:24,528
NoW, you don't Want me to have
to call your parents, do you?

213
00:14:24,735 --> 00:14:29,467
lt's all right, Emily, don't cry.
Just try to be a bit more conscientious.

214
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,264
Would you like a hug?

215
00:14:32,475 --> 00:14:36,071
l'll be good, l sWear!

216
00:14:36,746 --> 00:14:40,740
All right, Well, that's fine, Emily.
You're excused.

217
00:14:54,664 --> 00:14:56,724
Yes, We did it.
We did it, come on.

218
00:14:56,933 --> 00:15:00,630
Give me some. Give me some.
Give me some. Give me some of that.

219
00:15:01,104 --> 00:15:04,801
l Will see you cats
on the flip-flop. Later!

220
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:07,907
l heard she slipped
in the bathroom.

221
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:11,205
Yes, but We've got
a Wonderful neW substitute

222
00:15:11,414 --> 00:15:13,349
Who comes very
highly recommended.

223
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:17,714
Mr. Schneebly? Mr. Schneebly?
Yeah!

224
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:19,581
Hold on, buddy!

225
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:28,659
Oh, my God.
You've gotta be kidding me.

226
00:15:28,865 --> 00:15:31,629
Oh, man, this guy sucks, man.

227
00:15:31,835 --> 00:15:35,634
Here, call him.
Call him? Yeah, right.

228
00:15:45,982 --> 00:15:48,884
Ok. Yes, you can be in my band.

229
00:15:49,086 --> 00:15:51,280
But, Ned, no poWer plays, man.

230
00:15:51,488 --> 00:15:54,183
l've got vision up the butt,
so just go With it.

231
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,120
No, thanks.

232
00:15:57,094 --> 00:15:58,686
You're not a teacher, Ned.

233
00:15:58,894 --> 00:16:01,591
You're the cross-dressing,
blood-sucking incubus

234
00:16:01,798 --> 00:16:04,096
from Maggot Death.
That's the real you.

235
00:16:04,301 --> 00:16:06,860
DeWey, l'm not a satanic
sex god anymore.

236
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,903
l'm a Working stiff.
And that's cool.

237
00:16:10,106 --> 00:16:12,974
She's got you brainWashed.
l'm Working.

238
00:16:13,176 --> 00:16:15,508
That's terrific.
But Who are you, babe?

239
00:16:15,711 --> 00:16:17,441
This is my apartment, babe.

240
00:16:17,648 --> 00:16:20,639
Not if you don't pay your rent,
it's not. Get a job.

241
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:24,878
l got a job. l'll have rent by the end
of the Week. Go tell the mayor.

242
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:28,524
You got a job. Doing What?
l do What Ned does, temping.

243
00:16:28,725 --> 00:16:32,956
l'm not a temp. l'm a sub.
And soon l'll be a certified teacher.

244
00:16:33,163 --> 00:16:36,394
Come on, man!
One shoW, $20,000 prize,

245
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,535
We split it 60/40. Grab your bass
and come back to the garage.

246
00:16:40,736 --> 00:16:43,068
l mean, don't you miss rocking out?

247
00:16:43,273 --> 00:16:46,538
lf you think anyone is gonna
be in a band With you,

248
00:16:46,777 --> 00:16:48,870
you're more delusional
than l thought.

249
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:53,481
DeWey, you knoW, maybe it's time
to give up those dreams.

250
00:16:53,683 --> 00:16:57,881
l did, and things are going
really great for me.

251
00:17:15,105 --> 00:17:18,768
Are you gonna teach us anything
or are We just gonna sit here?

252
00:17:20,343 --> 00:17:22,242
Just do Whatever you Want.

253
00:17:24,346 --> 00:17:27,782
l Want to learn from my teacher.
Besides that.

254
00:17:28,585 --> 00:17:30,916
Freddy, What do you
like to do?

255
00:17:31,121 --> 00:17:34,021
l don't knoW, burn stuff?

256
00:17:34,223 --> 00:17:37,317
Just go out and have recess.

257
00:17:37,527 --> 00:17:42,726
My parents don't spend $1 5,000
a year for recess.

258
00:17:44,534 --> 00:17:46,968
You Want to learn something?
Yes, l do.

259
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,137
You Want me to teach
you something?

260
00:17:49,338 --> 00:17:51,671
All right, here's a useful lesson
for you.

261
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,537
Give up. Just quit.

262
00:17:54,744 --> 00:17:58,077
Because in this life, you can't Win.

263
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,376
Yeah, you can try, but in the end,
you're just gonna lose, bigtime,

264
00:18:02,586 --> 00:18:04,780
because the World is run
by The Man.

265
00:18:04,988 --> 00:18:06,386
Who?
The Man.

266
00:18:06,589 --> 00:18:08,182
Oh, you don't knoW The Man?

267
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:09,756
Well, he's everywhere.

268
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,726
ln the White House, doWn the hall.
Miss Mullins, she's The Man.

269
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:18,195
And The Man ruined the ozone,
and he's burning doWn the Amazon,

270
00:18:18,401 --> 00:18:21,528
and he kidnapped Shamu
and put her in a chlorine tank.

271
00:18:21,738 --> 00:18:26,038
There used to be a Way to stick it
to The Man. lt Was called rock 'n' roll.

272
00:18:26,242 --> 00:18:28,006
But guess What. Oh, no.

273
00:18:28,211 --> 00:18:31,544
The Man ruined that too
With a little thing called MTV!

274
00:18:32,414 --> 00:18:33,814
So don't Waste your time

275
00:18:34,017 --> 00:18:36,712
trying to make anything cool
or pure or aWesome.

276
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,084
The Man's just gonna call you a fat,
Washed-up loser and crush your soul.

277
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:44,384
So do yourselves a favor
and just give up!

278
00:18:49,365 --> 00:18:51,459
Mr. Schneebly, it's after 1 0.

279
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:55,068
On Tuesdays, the children

00:22:37,794 --> 00:22:39,818
NoW touch me, babe

307
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:42,624
Can't you see
That l am not afraid

308
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:48,034
LaWrence is good at piano

309
00:22:48,238 --> 00:22:51,298
He shall be rocking
ln my shoW

310
00:22:51,508 --> 00:22:55,204
Stop. That's perfect. You're perfect.
Stay right there, Ok?

311
00:22:55,412 --> 00:22:58,381
You. Could you come up here,
please?

312
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,241
What Was your name?
katie.

313
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:03,145
What Was that big thing
you Were playing today?

314
00:23:03,353 --> 00:23:04,580
Cello.

315
00:23:04,788 --> 00:23:07,313
This is a bass guitar.
lt's exactly the same,

316
00:23:07,523 --> 00:23:12,461
but instead of playing like this, you tip it
on the side, ''chello'', you've got a bass.

317
00:23:12,662 --> 00:23:14,128
Try it on.

318
00:23:14,864 --> 00:23:18,299
Ok, noW play this note
right here. That's a G.

319
00:23:19,035 --> 00:23:21,298
Ok, but let your fingers
do the rocking.

320
00:23:21,503 --> 00:23:23,664
keep that G coming all day long.

321
00:23:23,873 --> 00:23:25,170
G, G, G, G, G, G

322
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:28,833
Good. Stop. Are there any drummers
in the house?

323
00:23:29,778 --> 00:23:32,873
l play percussion.
You couldn't play anything else.

324
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:35,175
Shut up!
Come here, dude.

325
00:23:39,321 --> 00:23:42,519
Just see if you can do What l do.
Just give it a try.

326
00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:48,363
Ok? Give that a try.

327
00:23:54,136 --> 00:23:55,365
Ok!

328
00:23:55,571 --> 00:23:58,301
That's really good.
Just stay right here.

329
00:23:58,974 --> 00:24:03,070
All right, Ok.
LaWrence, give me a G note.

330
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,243
With the fifth above it.

331
00:24:06,449 --> 00:24:09,645
And the middle one.
No middle one, l changed my mind.

332
00:24:09,853 --> 00:24:11,286
NoW go an octave beloW.

333
00:24:11,488 --> 00:24:13,512
NoW give me some rhythm.

334
00:24:14,356 --> 00:24:16,450
And keep that same rhythm. Go.

335
00:24:16,659 --> 00:24:18,854
katie, remember that note, the G?

336
00:24:19,061 --> 00:24:22,930
Play it, but also keep it rocking. Good.

337
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:25,157
Ok, give me like a...
Like a:

338
00:24:28,438 --> 00:24:30,962
That's bad. That's like
George of the Jungle.

339
00:24:31,173 --> 00:24:34,040
Play it up here on the cymbal,
but really light.

340
00:24:34,644 --> 00:24:37,407
Oh, that's it!
Ok, keep going With that.

341
00:24:37,614 --> 00:24:40,980
You remember this thing
l taught you a minute ago?

342
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:45,217
Yes! Yes!

343
00:24:46,256 --> 00:24:49,248
All right, let's go!

344
00:24:55,798 --> 00:25:00,791
Stop. You guys, stop messing around.
We've got a lot of Work to do.

345
00:25:01,304 --> 00:25:05,673
Ok, people, pay attention, because
l do not Want to have to fail you.

346
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:08,207
l thought you didn't
believe in grades.

347
00:25:09,112 --> 00:25:12,569
Of course l believe in grades.
l Was testing you. You passed.

348
00:25:12,781 --> 00:25:15,546
Good Work, Summer.
Four-and-a-half stars for you.

349
00:25:15,751 --> 00:25:20,086
NoW, listen, normal kids
Would have been stoked to slack off,

350
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:23,691
but not you guys, because you're
not normal. You're special.

351
00:25:23,893 --> 00:25:26,156
Because you guys have
the right attitude,

352
00:25:26,362 --> 00:25:29,455
l think it's time We started
our neW class project.

353
00:25:29,665 --> 00:25:31,155
A science project?
No.

354
00:25:31,366 --> 00:25:35,133
lt's called...''Rock Band''.

355
00:25:35,672 --> 00:25:38,105
ls this a school project?
Yes.

356
00:25:38,307 --> 00:25:39,605
And it's a requirement.

357
00:25:39,808 --> 00:25:42,778
lt may sound easy,
but nothing could be harder.

358
00:25:42,979 --> 00:25:48,383
lt Will test your head and your mind
and your brain too.

359
00:25:48,585 --> 00:25:51,144
Will other schools be competing?

360
00:25:51,354 --> 00:25:53,253
You could say that.

361
00:25:53,455 --> 00:25:55,923
You could say that every school
in the state

362
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:58,319
Will be competing for the top prize.

363
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,994
What's the prize?

364
00:26:00,195 --> 00:26:05,462
A Win Will go on your permanent
record. Hello, Harvard, yo.

365
00:26:06,368 --> 00:26:09,361
We're not supposed
to get started until next quarter,

366
00:26:09,571 --> 00:26:13,269
but l think We should get a leg up
on the competition, don't you?

367
00:26:13,476 --> 00:26:14,738
l do.

368
00:26:14,943 --> 00:26:17,810
Who else Wants to go for the gold?
l do.

369
00:26:18,013 --> 00:26:21,575
All right. But if anyone finds out,
We'll be disqualified.

370
00:26:21,784 --> 00:26:24,776
So let's just keep it
on the doWn-loW, shall We?

371
00:26:24,988 --> 00:26:27,479
Can We tell our parents?
No! Trust me.

372
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,920
They don't Want to knoW.
keep it zipped.

373
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:33,653
All right, you guys,
let's kick it into overdrive.

374
00:26:33,863 --> 00:26:36,229
What are the rest of us
supposed to do?

375
00:26:36,432 --> 00:26:39,333
You just sit back
and enjoy the magic of rock.

376
00:26:39,535 --> 00:26:42,698
You mean We're not in the band?

377
00:26:44,007 --> 00:26:45,736
NoW, hold up noW.

378
00:26:45,942 --> 00:26:50,208
Just because you're not in the band
doesn't mean you're not in the band.

379
00:26:50,413 --> 00:26:52,778
We need backup singers.
Who can sing?

380
00:26:54,916 --> 00:26:56,179
You, sing.

381
00:26:56,385 --> 00:26:59,513
The sun'll come out tomorroW
Yes.

382
00:26:59,721 --> 00:27:03,213
Bet your bottom dollar
That tomorroW

383
00:27:03,425 --> 00:27:07,828
Stop. You've got it, and l don't
even knoW What it is, but you've got it.

384
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:11,397
And that's Why you're in the band.
You, sing.

385
00:27:11,601 --> 00:27:16,367
Amazing grace

386
00:27:16,571 --> 00:27:21,099
HoW sWeet the sound

387
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,904
That saved...
Stop, before l start crying.

388
00:27:24,113 --> 00:27:27,309
l found the missing ingredient.
You're in the band.

389
00:27:27,517 --> 00:27:29,951
l can sing.
You can?

390
00:27:30,153 --> 00:27:32,121
All right, Summer, belt it.

391
00:27:32,321 --> 00:27:36,155
Memory
All alone in the moonlight...

392
00:27:36,358 --> 00:27:37,986
Stop. Stop. Ok.

393
00:27:38,193 --> 00:27:40,423
Good. That's pretty good.
All right.

394
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:43,929
l can also play clarinet.
l'll find something for you.

395
00:27:44,133 --> 00:27:48,536
When We get back from lunch, l'll
assign the rest of you killer positions.

396
00:27:53,343 --> 00:27:55,810
Thank you.
You're Welcome.

397
00:27:56,045 --> 00:27:57,535
There you go.
Thank you.

398
00:27:57,747 --> 00:27:59,237
You're Welcome.

399
00:28:07,957 --> 00:28:10,424
Mr. Schneebly?
Yeah?

400
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:11,854
Hey, What's up?

401
00:28:12,662 --> 00:28:15,596
l don't think l should be in the band.
Why not?

402
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:19,233
l'm not cool enough.
People in bands are cool. l'm not cool.

403
00:28:19,434 --> 00:28:24,098
Dude, you are cool. The Way you play.
Why do you say you're not cool?

404
00:28:25,407 --> 00:28:27,398
Nobody ever talks to me.

405
00:28:28,111 --> 00:28:29,976
Well, those days are over, buddy.

406
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:32,875
You could be the ugliest sad sack
on the planet,

407
00:28:33,082 --> 00:28:36,449
but if you're in a rocking band,
you're the cat's pajamas.

408
00:28:36,652 --> 00:28:39,415
You're the bee's knees.
Bee's knees?

409
00:28:39,622 --> 00:28:41,249
Yeah, the bee's knees.

410
00:28:41,457 --> 00:28:43,856
You'll be the most popular guy
in school.

411
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:45,652
Ok. l'll do it.

412
00:28:46,362 --> 00:28:51,390
NoW, listen, this is a big commitment.
Don't say yes if you're gonna flake out.

413
00:28:51,867 --> 00:28:53,893
l Won't.
Larry...

414
00:28:54,703 --> 00:28:57,263
...Welcome to my World.

415
00:28:58,574 --> 00:29:00,064
Boom.

416
00:29:01,576 --> 00:29:04,045
Boom, a couple of these.
NoW, here.

417
00:29:04,247 --> 00:29:08,012
NoW give me a platform.
Let's rock, let's rock today.

418
00:29:08,217 --> 00:29:09,444
NoW do it to me.

419
00:29:09,652 --> 00:29:12,314
Let's rock, let's rock today.
That's good.

420
00:29:12,521 --> 00:29:14,182
Slap it.

421
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:16,050
Shoot it.

422
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:17,988
kaboot it.

423
00:29:18,193 --> 00:29:21,288
We'll Work on that later.
lt's a long shake. Get going.

424
00:29:21,497 --> 00:29:23,362
Good knuckle crack.

425
00:29:32,407 --> 00:29:34,773
Lead guitar...

426
00:29:35,344 --> 00:29:37,505
...Zack Attack. Take a seat.

427
00:29:38,914 --> 00:29:42,145
On bass, Posh Spice.

428
00:29:42,351 --> 00:29:45,615
On keyboards, Mr. Cool.

429
00:29:45,821 --> 00:29:48,483
And on drums, Spazzy McGee.

430
00:29:48,691 --> 00:29:51,250
Ok, Blondie, Brace Face,

431
00:29:51,461 --> 00:29:53,691
you're singing backup.

432
00:29:54,396 --> 00:30:00,028
All right, Tough Guy, Shortstop,
Fancy Pants, get over here.

433
00:30:00,236 --> 00:30:01,726
You're on security detail.

434
00:30:01,938 --> 00:30:04,963
Make sure no one outside
knoWs What We're doing.

435
00:30:05,173 --> 00:30:07,038
The band's future depends on you.

436
00:30:07,242 --> 00:30:11,076
Ok, your first mission:
soundproofing this room.

437
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,042
Get on it.

438
00:30:13,249 --> 00:30:15,410
Can l be the band stylist instead?

439
00:30:15,617 --> 00:30:17,414
Of course you can, Fancy Pants.

440
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:21,385
Ok. Carrot Top, Roadrunner,
Turkey Sub,

441
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,582
We're gonna have
a lot of equipment.

442
00:30:23,792 --> 00:30:26,090
We're talking amps, electric guitars,

443
00:30:26,295 --> 00:30:29,127
maybe even lasers
and smoke machines.

444
00:30:29,332 --> 00:30:31,925
NoW, your job is to master
the transportation

445
00:30:32,134 --> 00:30:34,328
and operation of this technology.

446
00:30:34,537 --> 00:30:38,496
Without a first-rate roadie creW,
We'll never have a psychedelic shoW,

447
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:43,441
and l can't live With that, Ok?
l'm counting on you. Get going. Go.

448
00:30:43,645 --> 00:30:45,579
All right.

449
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,771
You three...

450
00:30:49,317 --> 00:30:51,808
...groupies.
And your job is simple.

451
00:30:52,255 --> 00:30:53,688
Just Worship the band.

452
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:57,347
You're gonna be making hats,
you're gonna be making T-shirts,

453
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:01,290
all kinds of merchandise, Which
leads me to your first assignment:

454
00:31:01,497 --> 00:31:03,795
Naming the band.
Yes.

455
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,468

456
00:31:06,669 --> 00:31:12,732
As for me, l Will be singing lead vocal
and shredding guitar.

457
00:31:12,942 --> 00:31:15,933
Wait. lsn't this a student project?

458
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:19,978
What's your point?
Are you supposed to be in the band?

459
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:24,314
What, you Want to get rid of me?
Why, because l'm old?

460
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:27,421
You hate teachers,

461
00:31:27,623 --> 00:31:29,647
Ok, Well, teachers like to play too.

470
00:31:56,919 --> 00:31:59,443
related to the musical direction
of the band.

471
00:31:59,888 --> 00:32:03,256
And Will defer to him...
Direction...

00:32:06,561 --> 00:32:08,791
Let's get rocking!

473
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,375
Morning, Summer.
Groupie?

474
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:30,746
What's the matter?
You Want me to be a groupie?

475
00:32:30,952 --> 00:32:35,013
Groupie is an important job.
l researched groupies on the lnternet.

476
00:32:35,223 --> 00:32:37,453
They're sluts. They sleep
With the band.

477
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,560
No. That's not true.
They're like cheerleaders.

478
00:32:40,762 --> 00:32:44,596
l don't Want to be a cheerleader.
Look, my mother is a room parent,

479
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,098
and she's not gonna be happy
When she hears about this.

480
00:32:48,304 --> 00:32:51,671
Ok, l didn't Want to say this
in front of the other kids,

481
00:32:51,874 --> 00:32:54,365
but l made a special
position just for you.

482
00:32:54,576 --> 00:32:56,510
lt's the most important job
of all.

483
00:32:56,979 --> 00:32:58,207
Band manager.

484
00:32:58,847 --> 00:33:00,712
Band manager?
Oh, yeah.

485
00:33:00,915 --> 00:33:02,144
What's that?

486
00:33:02,351 --> 00:33:05,047

so it's up to you

487
00:33:05,253 --> 00:33:07,518
to make sure everyone
is doing their job.

488
00:33:07,722 --> 00:33:10,055
Summer, you're in charge
of everything.

489
00:33:11,626 --> 00:33:13,992
Ok.

All right, look alive. Listen up.

491
00:33:19,367 --> 00:33:21,893
First thing you do
When you start a band...

492
00:33:22,104 --> 00:33:26,369
Mr. Schneebly, before We start,
shouldn't l first take attendance?

493
00:33:27,209 --> 00:33:28,971
Ok, fine.

494
00:33:32,548 --> 00:33:34,913

Let's see. Tomika?
We're all here.

499
00:33:45,827 --> 00:33:51,892
The first thing you do When you start
a band is talk about your influences.

500
00:33:52,101 --> 00:33:56,162
That's hoW you figure out What kind

525
00:35:06,509 --> 00:35:09,443
We need to focus.
Don't you Wanna Win this contest?

526
00:35:09,644 --> 00:35:11,135
lt's prestigious.

527
00:35:12,248 --> 00:35:13,737
Question:

528
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:15,974
HoW are We being graded
in all this?

529
00:35:16,452 --> 00:35:20,581
Since l'm band manager, and l have
the most responsibility, Wouldn't...?

530
00:35:20,789 --> 00:35:25,351
Summer, if you grade-grub, l Will send
you back to the first grade. You got it?

531
00:35:25,561 --> 00:35:29,224

Fine.

532
00:35:29,431 --> 00:35:33,197
What are We gonna play?
You don't have to Worry about that.

533
00:35:33,402 --> 00:35:36,132
We have aWesome material,
Which l Wrote.

534
00:35:36,438 --> 00:35:38,030
Let's hear it.

535
00:35:39,108 --> 00:35:42,077
What?
Let's hear your song.

536
00:35:42,478 --> 00:35:44,275
You Wanna hear my song?

537
00:35:44,612 --> 00:35:46,637
l'll play you my song,
if you Want.

538
00:35:47,416 --> 00:35:50,213
The thing is,
l just Want you to keep in mind,

539
00:35:50,418 --> 00:35:52,545
l Wrote it in, like, 1 5 minutes.

540
00:35:53,088 --> 00:35:57,320
lt's not done. You might not like...
Just play the song, Schneebly.

541
00:35:57,525 --> 00:36:01,791
Ok, l Will sing it for you,
but let me just get in the zone.

542
00:36:01,996 --> 00:36:04,396
l Was not planning on unveiling it,

543
00:36:04,934 --> 00:36:07,266
but l Will sing it.

544
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:11,798
Tip of the tongue,
teeth and the lips.

545
00:36:16,177 --> 00:36:17,405
Ok.

546
00:36:17,612 --> 00:36:19,012
lt starts off...

547
00:36:19,215 --> 00:36:21,206
...a dark stage,

548
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:23,077
and then a beam of light,

549
00:36:23,284 --> 00:36:26,344
and you can see me
and my guitar.

550
00:36:30,425 --> 00:36:32,985
ln the end of time

551
00:36:33,195 --> 00:36:36,460
There Was a man
Who kneW the road

552
00:36:36,664 --> 00:36:41,625
And the Writing
Was Written on the stone

553
00:36:41,836 --> 00:36:44,965
And then a thin layer of fog
comes in around my ankles.

554
00:36:45,173 --> 00:36:48,735
Roadies, that means dry ice.
We're gonna talk about this later.

555
00:36:48,943 --> 00:36:51,639
ln the ancient time

556
00:36:51,847 --> 00:36:54,315
An artist led the Way

557
00:36:54,516 --> 00:37:00,045
But no one
Seemed to understand

558
00:37:00,255 --> 00:37:02,052
Chimes, Freddy.

559
00:37:02,257 --> 00:37:05,021
ln his heart he kneW

560
00:37:05,226 --> 00:37:08,219
The artist must be true

561
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:13,197
But the legend of the rent
Was Way past due

562
00:37:13,402 --> 00:37:16,496
And then, katie, you come in
With the bass.

563
00:37:20,842 --> 00:37:25,974
Well, you think you'll be just fine
Without me, but you're mine

564
00:37:26,181 --> 00:37:29,014
y ou think you can
Kick me out of the band

565
00:37:29,217 --> 00:37:32,585
And then, Zack, you come in
With a face-melter.

566
00:37:34,856 --> 00:37:38,588
Ok?
Well, there's just one problem there

567
00:37:38,793 --> 00:37:41,159
The band is mine

568
00:37:41,362 --> 00:37:46,197
HoW can you kick me out
Of What is mine?

569
00:37:46,402 --> 00:37:47,630
And then...

570
00:37:47,835 --> 00:37:50,304
HaWaii Five-O.
You ever see that shoW?

571
00:37:50,505 --> 00:37:53,407
Ok, Well,
there's a drum solo in it that goes:

572
00:37:53,876 --> 00:37:55,900
y ou're not hardcore

573
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,907
Unless you live hardcore

574
00:37:58,112 --> 00:38:00,376
And l Want the backup singers
to be like:

575
00:38:00,581 --> 00:38:03,380
Well, you're not hardcore
No, you're not hardcore

576
00:38:03,585 --> 00:38:06,418
Unless you live hardc--
Unless you live hardcore

577
00:38:06,621 --> 00:38:10,990
But the legend of the rent
Was Way hardcore

578
00:38:11,193 --> 00:38:13,753
Boom! Big old explosion.

579
00:38:13,963 --> 00:38:16,454
Some, like, confetti comes doWn.

580
00:38:16,664 --> 00:38:19,532
That's all l got so far.
lt's a Work in progress.

581
00:38:19,735 --> 00:38:23,034
l liked it, Mr. Schneebly.
l thought it Was really catchy.

582
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:26,335
Thank you.

583
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:29,737
Mr. S? We came up
With some names for the band.

584
00:38:29,945 --> 00:38:32,378
Yeah? Hit me.
The Bumblebees?

585
00:38:32,581 --> 00:38:34,639
No, it's sissy.
The koala Bears?

586
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:37,079
What are you talking about?
lt's sissy.

587
00:38:37,286 --> 00:38:39,583
l need to speak
With Principal Mullins.

588
00:38:39,788 --> 00:38:42,416
Hey, Miss Mullins. Hello.
HoW's it going?

589
00:38:42,623 --> 00:38:45,057
HoW about ''Pig Rectum''?
Michelle!

590
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,851
lt's a science project.

591
00:38:47,061 --> 00:38:51,396
Listen, Ros, l Was thinking
about organizing a field trip.

592
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,931
What do you think about that?
Well...

593
00:38:54,135 --> 00:38:57,230
...substitutes, as a rule,
do not organize field trips.

594
00:38:57,438 --> 00:38:59,998
But l figure l'm gonna be here
for a While.

595
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:03,110
Well, that remains to be seen.

596
00:39:03,311 --> 00:39:05,711
Have you met our other teachers?
No.

597
00:39:05,914 --> 00:39:09,349
But the kids could learn
by getting out of the classroom.

598
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:12,782
lt's more complicated than that.
There's safety issues.

599
00:39:12,987 --> 00:39:16,389
Parents need to be notified.
lt's against school policy.

600
00:39:16,592 --> 00:39:19,492
Mr. S, l have a lot of ideas.

601
00:39:19,695 --> 00:39:22,891
HoW about everyone in magenta
With beads and sequins?

602
00:39:23,097 --> 00:39:25,726
Billy, l'm talking to Principal Mullins.

603
00:39:25,934 --> 00:39:27,958
Oh, hi.
William.

604
00:39:28,269 --> 00:39:29,760
l'll make up some samples.

605
00:39:30,438 --> 00:39:34,340
Everyone, this is Ned Schneebly.
He's covering for Gail.

606
00:39:34,543 --> 00:39:37,478
Gabe Green. He teaches second.
Jane Lemmons, fourth.

607
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:38,976
Bob's our P.E. teacher.

608
00:39:39,181 --> 00:39:41,581
Roberta's our librarian.
HoW do you do?

609
00:39:41,784 --> 00:39:44,411
Care to join us, Mr. Schneebly?
Yeah.

610
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:49,250
Did l say that correctly? ''Schneebly''?
Actually, it's ''Schnayblay''.

611
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:51,358
We Were just discussing testing.

612
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:55,427
Which test do you find most effective,
the TASS or the Wilson-Binet?

613
00:39:55,831 --> 00:39:58,822
l say no testing,
and l Will tell you Why, Joe.

614
00:39:59,034 --> 00:40:02,025
Gabe.
Gabe. l believe...

615
00:40:02,237 --> 00:40:05,070
...that the children are the future.

616
00:40:05,273 --> 00:40:06,969
NoW, you can teach them Well,

617
00:40:07,175 --> 00:40:09,507
but you have gotta let them
lead the Way.

618
00:40:10,045 --> 00:40:12,478
Let the children's laughter...

619
00:40:12,681 --> 00:40:14,672
...just remind us
hoW We used to be.

620
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:17,746
That's What l decided long ago.

621
00:40:18,753 --> 00:40:20,346
lsn't that a song?

622
00:40:21,456 --> 00:40:24,688
No. l don't think so. No.

623
00:40:24,893 --> 00:40:26,190
No?
No, it isn't.

624
00:40:26,394 --> 00:40:27,952
You sure?

625
00:40:30,666 --> 00:40:37,003
So you think you'll be just fine
Without me, but you're mine

626
00:40:37,206 --> 00:40:42,074
y ou think you can
Kick me out of the band

627
00:40:43,244 --> 00:40:46,577
Well, there's just one problem there

628
00:40:46,782 --> 00:40:49,648
The band is mine

629
00:40:49,851 --> 00:40:53,913
HoW can you kick me out
Of What is mine?

630
00:40:54,123 --> 00:40:55,351
Everybody.

631
00:40:55,556 --> 00:40:58,650
Because you're not hardcore
No, you're not hardcore

632
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:01,829
Unless you live hardcore
Unless you live hardcore

633
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:07,092
But the legend of the rent
Was Way hardcore

634
00:41:07,302 --> 00:41:09,269
All right. Good. Stop.

635
00:41:09,471 --> 00:41:11,166
Ok, Freddy, that Was aWesome.

636
00:41:11,373 --> 00:41:13,898
You're rocking,
but it's a little sloppy-joe.

637
00:41:14,108 --> 00:41:16,474
Tighten up the screWs, Ok?

638
00:41:16,677 --> 00:41:19,840
Zack, dude, What's up
With the stiffness, man?

639
00:41:20,047 --> 00:41:23,539
You're looking a little robotronic.
Ok?

640
00:41:23,751 --> 00:41:26,721
Let's grease up the hinges,
and listen,

641
00:41:26,922 --> 00:41:29,755
loosey-goosey, baby,
loosey-goosey.

642
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:33,586
l'm playing it the Way you told me.
l knoW, it's perfect.

643
00:41:33,795 --> 00:41:37,731
But rock is about the passion, man.
Where's the joy?

644
00:41:37,932 --> 00:41:41,699
You're lead guitarist. We are
counting on you for style, brother.

645
00:41:41,903 --> 00:41:45,635
So try out this ancient technique.
lt's called ''poWer stance''.

646
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,206
That's it. You oWn the universe.

647
00:41:48,409 --> 00:41:50,878
NoW give me an E chord.
Just go:

648
00:41:51,646 --> 00:41:53,773
But let me hear:

649
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:58,884
Yeah, noW raise your goblet of rock.
lt's a toast to those Who rock.

650
00:41:59,086 --> 00:42:02,545
NoW smile and nod your head
and let me see your eyeballs Wide

651
00:42:02,757 --> 00:42:04,918
like there's something Wrong.
Yeah!

652
00:42:05,126 --> 00:42:07,027
Do it again. Give me that:

653
00:42:08,797 --> 00:42:11,856
That's What l'm talking about.
Ok, let's do it again,

654
00:42:12,067 --> 00:42:14,534
from ''You're not hardcore''.
One, tWo, three.

655
00:42:14,735 --> 00:42:17,534
y ou're not hardcore
No, you're not hardcore

656
00:42:17,739 --> 00:42:20,731
Unless you live hardcore
Unless you live hardcore

657
00:42:20,943 --> 00:42:25,436
And the legend of the rent
Was Way hardcore

658
00:42:25,646 --> 00:42:28,137
Yeah! NoW We're rocking.

659
00:42:28,349 --> 00:42:31,911
Your homeWork is to listen
to some real music. Get inspired.

660
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:34,349
For Blondie, Blondie.

661
00:42:34,556 --> 00:42:37,684
For LaWrence, Yes.
That's the name of the band.

662
00:42:37,893 --> 00:42:40,521
Listen to the keyboard solo
on ''Roundabout''.

663
00:42:40,728 --> 00:42:44,597
lt Will bloW the classical music
out your butt.

664

Ok, for you, Rush, 2 1 1 2.

one of the great drummers
of all time. Study up.

666
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,932
Are We gonna goof off every day?
We're not goofing off.

667
00:42:56,143 --> 00:42:57,907
We're creating musical fusion.

668
00:42:58,112 --> 00:43:00,239
Are We gonna do that every day?

669
00:43:00,449 --> 00:43:02,815
Yeah. Get used to it.

670
00:43:03,552 --> 00:43:07,579
Ok, and for you, Jimi Hendrix,
Axis; Bold As Love.

671
00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:11,155
Are you psyched about the project?
Sure.

672
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,793
''Sure''? Hey. Wait. What's up?
Are you...?

673
00:43:13,996 --> 00:43:17,090
You're the lead guitarist
of an unbelievable rock band.

674
00:43:17,398 --> 00:43:19,958
This is a dream come true for you.
Ok.

675
00:43:20,835 --> 00:43:23,827
All right. l'll see you.

676
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:27,371
Mr. S?
Hey, Tomika, What's up?

677
00:43:27,775 --> 00:43:31,711
l don't Want to be a roadie.
Why not? lt's an important job.

678
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,347
All right. Well...

679
00:43:34,548 --> 00:43:36,813
You Wanna be security?

680
00:43:37,418 --> 00:43:38,715
l Wanna be a singer.

681
00:43:39,621 --> 00:43:41,282
A singer?

682
00:43:41,757 --> 00:43:43,987
Ok. Sing me something.

683
00:43:46,661 --> 00:43:49,255
l can't let you be a singer
if you can't sing.

684
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:53,730
y ou told me
To leave you alone

685
00:43:53,934 --> 00:43:58,065
My papa said,
''Come on home''

686
00:43:58,273 --> 00:44:02,369
My doctor said,
''Take it easy''

687
00:44:02,577 --> 00:44:05,478
But your loving
ls much too strong

688
00:44:05,681 --> 00:44:10,550
l'm Welded to your
Chain, chain, chain

689
00:44:10,918 --> 00:44:14,286
Oh, my goodness.
Nice pipes, Tomika.

690
00:44:14,489 --> 00:44:18,016
Why didn't you raise your hand
When l Was looking for singers?

691
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,925
You're in.

692
00:44:20,128 --> 00:44:24,224
Welcome aboard. Ok, perfect.
Pink Floyd, Dark Side of the Moon.

693
00:44:24,432 --> 00:44:27,630
Listen to the vocal solo
on ''The Great Gig in the Sky''.

694
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:30,896
All right? All right.

695
00:44:40,315 --> 00:44:41,976
Off to Work.

696
00:44:42,184 --> 00:44:43,981
Goodbye.

697
00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:56,523
You can play music
after your homeWork,

698
00:44:56,731 --> 00:44:58,858
after your chores,
but not until then.

699
00:44:59,067 --> 00:45:02,867
Zack! Zack, do not Walk aWay from me
When l'm talking to you.

700
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,971
lt's very rude. All right?

701
00:45:05,172 --> 00:45:07,835
Last thing...
Guitar after homeWork and chores,

00:45:08,043 --> 00:45:10,204
and only What Miss Sheinkopf
gives you.

703
00:45:10,411 --> 00:45:12,346
No more rock music. Ok?
Ok.

704
00:45:12,547 --> 00:45:14,572
All right, get to class.

705
00:45:15,016 --> 00:45:16,244
Watch that attitude.

706
00:45:17,052 --> 00:45:19,179
Do you have another blanket?

707
00:45:21,422 --> 00:45:23,186
That's good.

708
00:45:30,565 --> 00:45:33,659
All right. Everybody,

709

00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:40,833
lf l Was gonna give you a grade,
l'd give you an A.

712
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:42,440
But that's the problem.

713
00:45:42,643 --> 00:45:44,737
Rock ain't about doing things
perfect.

714
00:45:44,945 --> 00:45:47,141
Who can tell me
What it's really about?

715
00:45:48,516 --> 00:45:50,143
Frankie?

716

00:46:01,362 --> 00:46:03,831
Yes! But you can't just say it, man.

721
00:46:04,032 --> 00:46:06,398
You gotta feel it
in your blood and guts.

722
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:09,126
lf you Wanna rock,
you gotta break the rules.

723
00:46:09,336 --> 00:46:12,795
You gotta get mad at The Man,
and right noW l'm The Man.

724
00:46:13,007 --> 00:46:16,876
That's right, l'm The Man,
and Who's got the guts to tell me off?

725
00:46:17,077 --> 00:46:20,478
Who's gonna tell me off?
Shut the hell up, Schneebly!

726
00:46:21,115 --> 00:46:23,481
That's it, Freddy. That's it.

727
00:46:23,684 --> 00:46:26,813
Who can top him?
Get out of here, stupid ass.

728
00:46:27,021 --> 00:46:28,989
Yes, Alicia.

729
00:46:29,257 --> 00:46:32,282
You're a joke. You're the Worst teacher
l've ever had.

730
00:46:32,494 --> 00:46:34,222
Summer, that is great.

731
00:46:34,429 --> 00:46:37,887
l like the delivery. l felt your anger.
Thank you.

732
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:40,567
You're a fat loser,
and you have body odor.

733
00:46:41,068 --> 00:46:43,628
All right. All right.

734
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:46,467

We've already told me off.
Let's move on.

739
00:47:00,222 --> 00:47:04,181
You're tacky, and l hate you.
Ok, you see me after class.

740

763
00:48:49,797 --> 00:48:53,666
and l nailed the audish,
but l didn't get it. Guess Who did.

764
00:48:53,867 --> 00:48:57,326
Yo-Yo Ma's cousin, little ''nepotis''.

765
00:48:57,539 --> 00:49:00,632
Anyway, l just decided to give up
and become a teacher,

766
00:49:00,842 --> 00:49:04,005
because those that can't do, teach.

767
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:08,307
And those that can't teach,
teach gym. Am l right?

768
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:16,617
l'm just joshing.
Cute.

769
00:49:16,824 --> 00:49:18,884
Hey, Mr. Schneebly.
Hey, Zack.

770
00:49:19,094 --> 00:49:21,561
That Was a really cool lesson today.

771
00:49:21,762 --> 00:49:23,025
Well, thanks, dude.

772
00:49:23,331 --> 00:49:25,322
l'll see you back in class.
Ok.

773
00:49:54,795 --> 00:49:58,391
Flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it!
No, no, no.

774
00:51:41,536 --> 00:51:44,869
l'm just saying, name tWo
great chick drummers.

775
00:51:45,072 --> 00:51:47,735
Sheila E? Meg White
from the White Stripes?

776
00:51:47,942 --> 00:51:50,637
She can't drum.
She's better than you.

777
00:51:50,844 --> 00:51:52,369
At least she has rhythm.

778
00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:56,606
Freddy, Where are your sleeves?
And What have you done to your hair?

779
00:51:56,818 --> 00:52:00,947
lt's called punk.
Well, it's not school uniform.

780
00:52:03,257 --> 00:52:07,387
Miss Mullins, you're The Man.
Thank you, Frankie.

781
00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:17,233
Good morning.
Just a reminder:

782
00:52:17,438 --> 00:52:19,030
Parents' Night is coming up,

783
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:21,833
and l expect everyone
to have a presentation.

784
00:52:22,043 --> 00:52:23,976
What? Hot!

785
00:52:27,081 --> 00:52:29,014
You Ok?
lt's all right.

786
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:33,451
As you knoW, it is the most
important event of the year.

787
00:52:33,655 --> 00:52:35,748
The parents scrutinize
our every move,

788
00:52:35,956 --> 00:52:40,552
so l find it's best to over-prepare.
Right?

789
00:52:40,762 --> 00:52:43,025
The best defense
is a good offense.

790
00:52:43,898 --> 00:52:46,492
And, Roberta, noW that l see you...

791
00:52:47,467 --> 00:52:51,563
Hey, is she alWays like that?

792
00:52:52,005 --> 00:52:53,974
Oh, yeah.

793
00:52:54,775 --> 00:52:59,644
Except for the time she got drunk
at the alumni dinner.

794
00:52:59,847 --> 00:53:01,509
You should have seen that.

795
00:53:01,715 --> 00:53:06,175
She got up on the table and did
a Stevie Nicks impersonation.

796
00:53:06,387 --> 00:53:08,445
And she Wasn't bad.

797
00:53:08,655 --> 00:53:12,557
Remember, she took up the tablecloth
and Whirled around With it?

798
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,887
...that had been
on the turkey tray

799
00:53:15,096 --> 00:53:18,724
that Were touched over onto
the peanut-butter-and-jelly tray.

800
00:53:18,932 --> 00:53:23,028
NoW, l knoW that you knoW
that this is a severe problem.

801
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:30,599
Clear.

802
00:53:31,045 --> 00:53:33,172
Come on. Go, go, go!

803
00:53:48,128 --> 00:53:50,528

804
00:53:50,731 --> 00:53:53,166

805
00:54:01,242 --> 00:54:02,469
Oh, dude, cool.

806
00:54:13,521 --> 00:54:16,387
Three horns.
That's very clever.

807
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:23,820
ln 1 492, Columbus
sailed the ocean... ?

808
00:54:24,032 --> 00:54:27,695
Blue.
Blue. That's right.

809
00:54:27,902 --> 00:54:33,396
OK. NoW, Columbus had three boats.
The Nina, the... ?

Pinta, that's right. And... ?

812
00:54:39,112 --> 00:54:41,172
Marco?
Santa Marina?

813
00:54:41,382 --> 00:54:43,246
The Santa Marina.

814
00:54:43,451 --> 00:54:46,385
That's good.
Actually, it's Santa Maria.

815
00:54:46,586 --> 00:54:48,646
OK. NoW, you got...

816
00:54:48,856 --> 00:54:51,449
Listen. Pay attention, kids.

817
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:53,523
l'm not afraid to flunk you.

818
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:55,088
What's up, dude?

819
00:54:55,295 --> 00:54:57,264
Check out these little kids, man.

820
00:54:57,465 --> 00:54:59,626
Hey, shut up.
Oh, sorry.

821
00:54:59,833 --> 00:55:03,793
Thought this Was Battle of the Bands,
not the Mickey Mouse Club.

822
00:55:04,005 --> 00:55:06,132
Want a piece of me?
Look at this.

823
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:08,605
Freddy! Come on, man.
We gotta focus up.

824
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:10,539

825
00:55:10,744 --> 00:55:12,541

832
00:55:37,804 --> 00:55:39,795
What is it? Are you nervous?

833
00:55:40,541 --> 00:55:43,065
Yeah? Why?
What are you afraid of?

00:55:44,045 --> 00:55:47,572
They're gonna laugh at me.
Why Would they laugh at you?

835
00:55:47,782 --> 00:55:50,717

836
00:55:51,652 --> 00:55:53,347
Tomika...

837
00:55:54,322 --> 00:55:56,688
Hey, you've got something
everybody Wants.

838
00:55:56,891 --> 00:55:58,585
You've got talent, girl.

839
00:55:58,793 --> 00:56:01,956
You have an incredible voice.
l'm not just saying that.

840
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:06,188
You heard of Aretha Franklin, right?
Ok, she's a big lady.

841
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,994
But When she sings,
she bloWs people's minds.

842
00:56:09,202 --> 00:56:11,398
Everybody Wants to party

843
00:56:11,773 --> 00:56:14,570

You knoW What?

The thing is,

851
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:39,396

858
00:56:57,717 --> 00:57:00,380
Where?
Some guys invited him to their van.

859
00:57:00,588 --> 00:57:03,989
What?! Come on, you guys!

860
00:57:06,293 --> 00:57:07,818
Freddy?

861
00:57:08,028 --> 00:57:10,793
Hey, have you seen a little kid,

862
00:57:12,032 --> 00:57:16,094

00:57:21,943 --> 00:57:24,809
What's going on here?
Nothing. Just chilling.

865
00:57:25,012 --> 00:57:27,378
Freddy, get out of that van
this instant.

866
00:57:29,317 --> 00:57:31,148
See you guys.

867
00:57:31,952 --> 00:57:35,820
You think you're pretty funny,
partying With an innocent little kid?

868
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:38,217
Dude, We're just chilling.

869
00:57:38,425 --> 00:57:41,019
That kid's 1 0 years old.
He looks up to you.

870
00:57:41,228 --> 00:57:46,632
You are setting an example for him,

871
00:57:46,833 --> 00:57:50,291
That goes for all of you guys.

l Was hanging With real rockers.

876
00:58:02,416 --> 00:58:04,748
They aren't real rockers.
They're posers.

877
00:58:04,952 --> 00:58:07,715
Rock ain't about getting loaded
and being a jerk.

878
00:58:07,922 --> 00:58:11,824
NoW, this is serious business here.
We've got a mission.

879
00:58:12,025 --> 00:58:14,960
Putting on a great shoW
is the most important thing.

880
00:58:15,163 --> 00:58:18,030
One great rock shoW
can change the World.

881
00:58:18,231 --> 00:58:21,257
Do you understand me?
Yeah.

882
00:58:21,469 --> 00:58:24,369
lf you ever scare me like that again,
so help me,

883

00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:42,016
Auditions are over.

888
00:58:42,222 --> 00:58:45,351
Listen...you can't leave.
You haven't heard our band.

889
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:49,257
The bill is full. We're overbooked.

890
00:58:49,463 --> 00:58:50,793
We're here. We're ready.

00:58:52,733 --> 00:58:54,893
kids? ls this some kind
of gimmick?

893
00:58:55,101 --> 00:58:58,128
lt's not a gimmick.
They're kids, but they're aWesome.

894
00:58:58,338 --> 00:59:02,275
Thanks for coming doWn, but you're

lt Was just a Warm-up.

We'll still compete
against the other schools.

901
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:26,588
What? This is the gig, Summer.
This Was our Woodstock.

902
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,030
Then We shouldn't take no
for an ansWer.

903
00:59:29,237 --> 00:59:32,434
Don't take no for an ansWer?
He Was gonna call the fuzz.

904
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:34,630
Would you just listen to me?

905
00:59:35,141 --> 00:59:37,007

907
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:46,880
l shouldn't have barged in here.

908
00:59:47,088 --> 00:59:49,021
lt Wasn't fair to you or the kids,

909
00:59:49,222 --> 00:59:51,623
especially after What
they've been through.

910
00:59:51,826 --> 00:59:55,728
God, l feel like a jerk. God.
l'm taking them back to the hospital.

911
00:59:55,929 --> 00:59:58,592
Just Wanted to say l'm sorry.
That's fine.

912
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:02,826

Really? That's nice.

914
01:00:05,472 --> 01:00:07,907
That's very nice.
Actually, it isn't,

915
01:00:08,108 --> 01:00:11,840
because l totally screWed up.
l told the kids if they practiced,

916
01:00:12,045 --> 01:00:14,947
they'd get into
Battle of the Bands.

917

01:00:18,853 --> 01:00:23,516
l Wanted to give them something to
look forward to, to keep their spirits up.

919
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:25,853
Look at them.

920
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:28,228
They're terminal.

921
01:00:28,862 --> 01:00:30,228
Every last one of them.

922
01:00:34,235 --> 01:00:36,601
Jeez.
Yeah, and all they Wanted to do

923
01:00:36,804 --> 01:00:39,967
before they bit the dust
Was play Battle of the Bands.

924
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,907
What do they all have?

925
01:00:43,143 --> 01:00:45,442
lt's a...

926
01:00:45,646 --> 01:00:50,514
lt's a rare blood disease.
''Stick-it-to-da-man-niosis''.

927
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:54,016
What's that?
l've never heard of it.

928
01:00:54,221 --> 01:00:57,213
You're lucky. Because it's hell.

929
01:00:57,791 --> 01:00:59,487
WoW.

930
01:01:10,603 --> 01:01:12,628
We're on the bill.
Yes!

931
01:01:13,273 --> 01:01:16,106
Cut it out! You're dying, remember?

932
01:01:18,278 --> 01:01:19,905
Get in the van.

933
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:38,391
We come from the land
Of the ice and snoW

934
01:01:38,599 --> 01:01:41,396
From the midnight sun
Where the hot springs bloW

935
01:01:41,601 --> 01:01:43,865
The hammer of the gods

936
01:01:44,137 --> 01:01:47,471
Summer, you get an A-plus
and 50 gold stars.

937
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:51,135
l didn't do it for the grade.
Give me some of that.

938
01:01:51,344 --> 01:01:53,710
Yeah! Yeah!

939
01:02:02,757 --> 01:02:05,123
And it Was so scary.

940
01:02:18,338 --> 01:02:20,398
Hey, Mr. S?

941
01:02:20,641 --> 01:02:22,733
We have a name for the band.

942
01:02:22,943 --> 01:02:24,501
Hit me.

943
01:02:28,548 --> 01:02:30,744
The School of Rock.

944
01:02:32,952 --> 01:02:36,889
The School of Rock.

945
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:45,159
And We shall teach
rock 'n' roll to the World.

946
01:02:45,365 --> 01:02:51,032
There's no Way you can stop

947
01:02:51,438 --> 01:02:56,034
The School of Rock
y eah

948
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:59,043
Stop. We have a red alert.
lt's Mullins.

949
01:02:59,246 --> 01:03:01,271
Let's go. Come on.

950
01:03:01,614 --> 01:03:04,811
To your positions.
To your positions!

951
01:03:08,121 --> 01:03:10,181
Come on, come on.

952
01:03:17,764 --> 01:03:23,168
And therefore, E=MC2.

953
01:03:23,369 --> 01:03:25,132
Oh, Miss Mullins. Come in.

954
01:03:25,338 --> 01:03:29,536
l'm sorry to interrupt, but Miss
Lemmons said she heard music

955
01:03:29,742 --> 01:03:33,509
coming from the classroom.
Music?

956
01:03:34,715 --> 01:03:37,581
Music. l haven't heard any music.

957
01:03:37,784 --> 01:03:41,550
You knoW What? Miss Lemmons
must be on crack, right, kids?

958
01:03:43,289 --> 01:03:47,090
Well... Well, What's that?

959
01:03:51,699 --> 01:03:54,030
Oh, that. Yeah.

960
01:03:54,235 --> 01:03:57,101
We Were singing. We Were singing
and learning.

961
01:03:58,371 --> 01:04:01,101
We Were learning in sing-song.

962
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:05,271
One of your methods?
Yeah.

963
01:04:05,478 --> 01:04:08,539
l find it's helpful When
you're teaching the subjects

964
01:04:08,748 --> 01:04:11,081
that are the boring subjects.

965
01:04:13,653 --> 01:04:20,081
Well, you don't mind if l just sit in
on your class this afternoon, do you?

966
01:04:20,293 --> 01:04:22,956
No. No. Come on back
this afternoon.

967
01:04:23,163 --> 01:04:25,289
lt is the afternoon. l meant noW.

968
01:04:27,233 --> 01:04:31,864
So please just continue
With your method.

969
01:04:32,438 --> 01:04:35,340
Yeah. Ok.

970
01:04:51,291 --> 01:04:55,422
Math is a Wonderful thing

971
01:04:56,730 --> 01:05:00,563
Math is a really cool thing

972
01:05:01,135 --> 01:05:03,467
So get off your ''ath''
Let's do some math

973
01:05:03,670 --> 01:05:07,038
Math, math, math, math, math

974
01:05:09,143 --> 01:05:13,670
Three minus four is...
Negative one.

975
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,347
That's right.

976
01:05:15,815 --> 01:05:20,809
And six times a billion is...

977
01:05:22,623 --> 01:05:25,148
Six billion?
Nailed it.

978
01:05:25,358 --> 01:05:30,353
And 54 is 45 more than...
What is the ansWer, Marta?

979
01:05:30,563 --> 01:05:33,965
Nine.
No, it's eight

980
01:05:36,003 --> 01:05:38,436
No, it's nine

981
01:05:39,773 --> 01:05:45,369
y es, l Was testing you
lt's nine

982
01:05:45,579 --> 01:05:49,173
And that's a magic number

983
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:55,349
l'm very happy that you're able
to extend your stay,

984
01:05:55,556 --> 01:06:01,425
but l must say, l find your methods
of teaching very unusual.

985
01:06:01,628 --> 01:06:06,224
Well, l did study With
Dr. Errol Von Straussenburgerbecken.

986
01:06:06,699 --> 01:06:09,099
Who?
Oh, you don't knoW him?

987
01:06:09,302 --> 01:06:15,572
Oh, he's, like, one of the leading
leaders in...unusual methods.

988
01:06:15,775 --> 01:06:19,905
Actually, he's hoW l Was appointed
to the Presidential Council

989
01:06:20,179 --> 01:06:22,842
for Experimental Educationers.

990
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:24,677
That sounds very impressive,

991
01:06:24,885 --> 01:06:29,184
but We're not interested
in experimental education here.

992
01:06:29,722 --> 01:06:34,751
So if from noW on you could just stick
to the curriculum, that Would be great.

993
01:06:34,961 --> 01:06:37,396
Yes. Right.
Thank you.

994
01:06:37,864 --> 01:06:39,559
Ros?

995
01:06:40,067 --> 01:06:41,762
Yes?
Do you knoW,

996
01:06:41,969 --> 01:06:46,905
l Would really love to talk some more
about your philosophy on teaching.

997
01:06:47,106 --> 01:06:49,905
Do you think maybe We could
grab some coffee?

998
01:06:50,177 --> 01:06:52,371
You Want to go
get some coffee With me?

999
01:06:52,913 --> 01:06:54,402
Yeah. l really Would.

1000
01:07:01,054 --> 01:07:05,923
You're sure you don't have coffee?
l'm quite sure.

1001
01:07:08,429 --> 01:07:12,126
Well, l've never been here before.

1002
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:18,067
l've never been to this side
of toWn before, in fact.

1003
01:07:19,005 --> 01:07:21,405
So l have been...

1004
01:07:21,608 --> 01:07:27,012
Well, l've been... l've been dying
to ask you something, Mr. Schneebly.

1005
01:07:27,213 --> 01:07:30,980
Please, call me ''DeWey''.
DeWey?

1006
01:07:31,818 --> 01:07:34,788
Ned. Call me ''Ned''.

1007
01:07:34,987 --> 01:07:38,753
l Was thinking of my other name.
My middle name.

1008
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,793
Yeah.
Well, Ned...

1009
01:07:45,865 --> 01:07:48,925
...in your experience,
hoW does Horace Green compare

1010
01:07:49,135 --> 01:07:51,570
to the other schools
that you've taught at?

1011
01:07:51,771 --> 01:07:53,797
Oh, your school is the best.

1012
01:07:54,541 --> 01:07:56,599
You're just saying that.
l'm not.

1013
01:07:56,809 --> 01:08:00,371
You knoW that kids at other schools
just have fun all the time?

1014
01:08:00,581 --> 01:08:04,608
They run around. There's no discipline.
They're happy. lt's anarchy.

1015
01:08:04,818 --> 01:08:08,617
This is the best school
l have ever teached at. l sWear.

1016
01:08:09,523 --> 01:08:11,490
l'll drink to that.

1017
01:08:17,831 --> 01:08:20,162
Stay there. l'm gonna put on
some music.

1018
01:08:57,570 --> 01:09:00,131
l love this song.
Really?

1019
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:02,831
Yes. Stevie Nicks.
Yeah.

1020
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:04,572
Stevie!

1021
01:09:04,778 --> 01:09:07,940
You knoW, she came to toWn,
and she did a concert,

1022
01:09:08,148 --> 01:09:12,811
and she Was just so...Wild.
l knoW. Oh, man.

1023
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:15,921
Oh, my gosh.
She put on the best shoW ever.

1024
01:09:17,858 --> 01:09:20,257
She's better live
than she is on the album.

1025
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:22,519
You knoW What l mean?
Yes, yes.

1026
01:09:22,729 --> 01:09:26,028
Oh, my gosh, no comparison.
Yeah.

1027
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:27,932
You knoW What?

1028
01:09:28,301 --> 01:09:31,362
Oh, man, l Would love
to take the kids to a concert.

1029
01:09:31,572 --> 01:09:32,903
Concert?
Yeah.

1030
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,971
There's one at the end
of the month.

1031
01:09:36,176 --> 01:09:40,703
The Philharmonic. They do classics.
They do Beethoven, Mozart...

1032
01:09:41,381 --> 01:09:43,679
...Enya, that kind of stuff.

1033
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:48,845
But you have a policy
about field trips.

1034
01:09:49,989 --> 01:09:53,288
Would it be educational?
Would it be educational?

1035
01:09:53,493 --> 01:09:55,984
lt could be very educational.

1036
01:09:58,998 --> 01:10:01,229
Maybe We can make an exception.
Yes!

1037
01:10:01,435 --> 01:10:03,460
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing

1038
01:10:04,136 --> 01:10:07,037
Ooh, baby, ooh, ooh

1039
01:10:07,573 --> 01:10:09,769
l'm holding you to that.

1040
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:11,738
Make an exception.

1041
01:10:12,945 --> 01:10:16,779
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh

1042
01:10:21,087 --> 01:10:22,315
TomorroW

1043
01:10:22,956 --> 01:10:29,225
Keeping your head over Water
Making a Wave When you can

1044
01:10:29,429 --> 01:10:32,591
Temporary layoff
Good time

1045
01:10:32,798 --> 01:10:35,996
Easy credit rip-off
Good time

1046
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:40,497
Scratching and surviving
Good time

1047
01:10:40,707 --> 01:10:42,731
Would you stop that, please?

1048
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:44,376
Yeah.

1049
01:10:45,811 --> 01:10:50,373
l had a really nice time.
Yeah, ditto.

1050
01:10:50,884 --> 01:10:53,444
This is the first time
a teacher has asked me

1051
01:10:53,654 --> 01:10:56,987
to do anything outside of school.
No Way.

1052
01:10:57,256 --> 01:10:59,350
lt's... lt's true.

1053
01:10:59,626 --> 01:11:02,423
ln six years.

1054
01:11:04,398 --> 01:11:06,332
Well, you knoW,

1055
01:11:06,533 --> 01:11:10,525
l think it might be one of those things
Where people are intimidated.

1056
01:11:10,737 --> 01:11:13,466
lntimidated?

1057
01:11:13,673 --> 01:11:15,505
They hate me.
No. They don't.

1058
01:11:15,708 --> 01:11:18,506
Yes, they do. They sure do.
l can see.

1059
01:11:18,712 --> 01:11:20,612
l Wasn't alWays like this.

1060
01:11:20,814 --> 01:11:24,716
l Wasn't alWays Wound this tight.
There Was a time When l Was fun.

1061
01:11:25,051 --> 01:11:28,145
l Was funny. l Was.

1062
01:11:28,354 --> 01:11:34,692
But you can't be funny and be
the principal of a prep school.

1063
01:11:34,895 --> 01:11:38,091
No, you cannot, because
When it comes to their kids,

1064
01:11:38,297 --> 01:11:41,391
these parents,
they have no sense of humor.

1065
01:11:42,101 --> 01:11:46,835
lf anything goes Wrong, it's my head.
lt's my head in the smasher.

1066
01:11:47,039 --> 01:11:51,340
These parents Will come doWn
on me like a nuclear bomb.

1067
01:11:51,545 --> 01:11:54,707
l can't make a mistake.
l gotta be perfect.

1068
01:11:54,914 --> 01:12:01,184
And that pressure has turned me into
one thing that l never Wanted to be.

1069
01:12:01,621 --> 01:12:03,452
A bitch.

1070
01:12:03,657 --> 01:12:07,592
No. You're not.
Yes, l am. l am a big one.

1071
01:12:08,328 --> 01:12:12,662
Well, l don't think so.
l think you're pretty cool.

1072
01:12:14,001 --> 01:12:15,229

1073
01:12:15,769 --> 01:12:19,431
No.
Yeah. You're Way cool.

1074
01:12:19,739 --> 01:12:21,469
Really?

1075
01:12:25,378 --> 01:12:27,573
Ok, drums?

01:12:35,122 --> 01:12:36,487
Mr. S.

1080
01:12:36,689 --> 01:12:38,487
What do you think?

1081
01:12:46,166 --> 01:12:47,655
l don't knoW. l...

1082
01:12:47,868 --> 01:12:50,359
They might be a little distracting.

1083
01:12:50,569 --> 01:12:54,233
lt's glitter rock and it's glam
and it's fabulous.

1084
01:12:55,809 --> 01:12:58,175
Billy, it's just not the right style.

1085
01:12:58,377 --> 01:13:00,538
You're gonna talk to me
about style?

1086
01:13:00,747 --> 01:13:03,408
You can't dress yourself.
Look at that boW tie.

1087
01:13:03,617 --> 01:13:05,413
Don't talk about my boW tie.

1088
01:13:05,618 --> 01:13:09,350
You knoW What, l give up.
They can just Wear their uniforms.

1089
01:13:09,989 --> 01:13:14,119
That's not a bad idea.
Not a bad idea?

1090
01:13:14,327 --> 01:13:16,886
l Was kidding.
Excuse me.

1091
01:13:18,064 --> 01:13:22,001
Hey, hey. What is that?
What's What?

1092
01:13:22,202 --> 01:13:25,432
What are you playing?
Just something l Wrote.

1093
01:13:25,671 --> 01:13:26,969
You Wrote a song?

1094
01:13:28,608 --> 01:13:32,009
Well, let's hear it.
No, it's not that good.

1095
01:13:32,378 --> 01:13:35,439
Come on, l Want to hear it,
kurt Cobain.

1096
01:13:36,315 --> 01:13:39,284
Ok, but l'm not much of a singer.
lt's all right.

1097
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:44,948
Baby, We Were making straight A's

1098
01:13:45,158 --> 01:13:48,149
But We Were stuck in a dumb daze

1099
01:13:48,795 --> 01:13:52,252
Don't take much
To memorize your lies

1100
01:13:52,466 --> 01:13:54,524
Feel like l've been hypnotized

1101
01:13:54,734 --> 01:13:59,398
Wait. You Wrote that?
You Wrote that?

1102
01:14:00,006 --> 01:14:02,439
That's it.
Guys, rock 'n' roll positions.

1103
01:14:02,641 --> 01:14:05,509
What are you doing?
We're gonna learn your song.

1104
01:14:05,712 --> 01:14:08,112
But Why?
That's What bands do, man.

1105
01:14:08,347 --> 01:14:10,872
Play each other's songs.
You got lyrics?

1106
01:14:11,518 --> 01:14:13,212
Hook me up.

1107
01:14:15,055 --> 01:14:17,956
No more secret songs.
All right, LaWrence,

1108
01:14:18,158 --> 01:14:20,921
no more reading. Time for rock.

1109
01:14:21,261 --> 01:14:23,729
Get on the drum. Bass it up.

1110
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:25,420
What Was that chord?
D.

1111
01:14:25,631 --> 01:14:27,429
Play it.
D...

1112
01:14:27,634 --> 01:14:32,297
...C, G, C.

1113
01:14:32,506 --> 01:14:36,203
Baby, We Were making straight A's
Yeah. Yeah.

1114
01:14:36,408 --> 01:14:39,400
But We Were stuck in a dumb daze

1115
01:14:39,613 --> 01:14:42,104
Don't take much
To memorize your lies

1116
01:14:42,314 --> 01:14:45,841
And if you Wanna be
The teacher's pet

1117
01:14:46,051 --> 01:14:49,078
Baby, you just better forget it

1118
01:14:49,288 --> 01:14:52,122
Rock is the reason
Rock is the rhyme

1119
01:14:52,324 --> 01:14:54,622
knoW What Would be better?

1120
01:14:54,828 --> 01:14:57,421
''Rock got no reason,
Rock got no rhyme.''

1121
01:14:57,631 --> 01:15:02,694
Can We try that? Also, We need
some ''ooh la-la's'', so like:

1122
01:15:02,903 --> 01:15:05,394
Try that. Can We take
it from the chorus?

1123
01:15:05,604 --> 01:15:08,233
One, tWo, three, four.
One, tWo, three.

1124
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:11,877
And if you Wanna be
The teacher's pet

1125
01:15:12,078 --> 01:15:15,137
Baby, you just better forget it

1126
01:15:15,347 --> 01:15:18,442
Rock got no reason
Rock got no rhyme

1127
01:15:19,152 --> 01:15:25,148
y ou'd better get me to school on time
And if you Wanna be the teacher's pet

1128
01:15:25,358 --> 01:15:28,384
Baby, you just better forget it

1129
01:15:28,595 --> 01:15:32,395
Rock got no reason
Rock got no rhyme

1130
01:15:32,599 --> 01:15:36,296
y ou better get me to school on time

1131
01:15:44,344 --> 01:15:47,073
l'm gonna solo there
if it's cool With you.

1132
01:15:47,279 --> 01:15:49,247
All right.
You can solo later.

1133
01:15:49,448 --> 01:15:52,645
Ok.
Let me rock a solo there, l can feel it.

1134
00:00:01,238 --> 00:00:03,570
TomorroW is the big day,
so get your rest.

1135
00:00:03,774 --> 00:00:07,176
No late parties, drinking tequila
and trying to get lucky.

1136
00:00:08,545 --> 00:00:11,538
Chances like this do not
come around every day.

1137
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:13,710
You've played hard in here,

1138
00:00:13,917 --> 00:00:17,580
and l am proud of every
last stinking one of you.

1139
00:00:18,522 --> 00:00:22,289
Let's just give this everything We got.
We may fall on our faces,

1140
00:00:22,492 --> 00:00:25,518
but if We do,
We Will fall With dignity!

1141
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:28,728
With a guitar in our hands
and rock in our hearts!

1142
00:00:28,932 --> 00:00:30,923
And in the Words of AC/DC:

1143
00:00:31,135 --> 00:00:34,832
''We roll tonight to the guitar bite,

1144
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,439
''and for those about to rock...

1145
00:00:38,643 --> 00:00:40,576
''...l salute you.''

1146
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:58,661
Ros, excuse me, Wanted to remind
you about our field trip tomorroW.

1147
00:00:58,862 --> 00:01:02,491
What field trip?
The educational concert.

1148
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,031
Oh, l forgot about that.

1149
00:01:05,236 --> 00:01:09,194
l don't knoW, school policy
is very difficult to get around.

1150
00:01:09,406 --> 00:01:11,966
But you said
We could make an exception,

1151
00:01:12,176 --> 00:01:15,076
and the kids are excited
about hearing some Mozart.

1152
00:01:15,278 --> 00:01:19,510
l knoW, but the preparations,
there's not enough time.

1153
00:01:19,716 --> 00:01:22,185
l don't knoW anything about it.
Where is it?

1154
00:01:22,587 --> 00:01:27,216
l've got it all covered.
What's going on, are you mad at me?

1155
00:01:27,424 --> 00:01:30,621
No, no, Ned. l'm sorry,
l'm just a little stressed out

1156
00:01:30,828 --> 00:01:32,852
because it's Parents' Night tonight.

1157
00:01:33,063 --> 00:01:37,796
Hey, it's all gonna be fine.

1158
00:01:40,971 --> 00:01:46,341
Ned, Would you mind coming
With me tonight to Parents' Night?

1159
00:01:46,977 --> 00:01:51,243
lt Wouldn't be a date or anything.
l get nervous around the parents,

1160
00:01:51,448 --> 00:01:55,111
and there's something about you
that makes me feel more relaxed.

1161
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:58,049
You knoW What,
that sounds so great, Ros, but...

1162
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,849
But What?
l Wasn't planning on going tonight.

1163
00:02:04,128 --> 00:02:08,394
You have to. You're their teacher.
You have to give the presentation.

1164
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:12,228
Oh, yeah, yeah. No, l got you.

So We'll go together?

1166
00:02:14,504 --> 00:02:19,237
Ok. Why don't you pick me up at,

1169
00:02:34,157 --> 00:02:35,647
That's Weird.

Green Prep for $1 ,200.

1171
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:41,489
l've never Worked there.

1172
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:47,860
What are you doing?
Calling the school.

1173
00:02:49,272 --> 00:02:51,673
Hi, this is Ned Schneebly...

1174
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,271
DeWey?

1175

DeWey?

1178
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:07,858

1179
00:03:08,391 --> 00:03:10,223
No.
Yeah.

1180
00:03:10,427 --> 00:03:13,829
They called for a sub. l said
l Was you, to make some money.

1181
00:03:14,031 --> 00:03:17,228
But then l got there, and the kids,
they rock, man.

1182
00:03:17,435 --> 00:03:21,394
There's this kid Larry Who's like,
''l'm not cool,'' but noW he's like:

1183
00:03:23,274 --> 00:03:25,741
There's this other girl
Who can sing like:

1184
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,740
She thought she Was too fat, so they
Were dying, and the principal got drunk.

1185
00:03:30,948 --> 00:03:34,747
NoW We're playing Battle of the Bands.
lt's the coolest thing!

1186
00:03:34,951 --> 00:03:37,112
One day.

00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,382
l'll tell everyone it Was my fault.
You'll be fine. One day!

1188
00:03:41,592 --> 00:03:43,855
Ned, home.
Don't say anything to her.

1189
00:03:44,061 --> 00:03:46,586
She'll bloW everything. Please?

1190
00:03:50,467 --> 00:03:53,231
Hey. What's going on?

1191
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,562
Nothing. l got a hot date,

1192
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:02,175
See you later.

1193
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:10,147
What's going on, Ned?

1194
00:04:11,855 --> 00:04:14,518
Nothing.
Nothing? Well...

1195
00:04:29,673 --> 00:04:33,473
Ok, l don't think l can go in there.

1196
00:04:34,644 --> 00:04:37,204
What's Wrong?
Ros...

1197
00:04:38,716 --> 00:04:40,274
...l'm not a teacher.

1198
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:44,913
Oh, Ned. A substitute is a teacher.

1199
00:04:45,122 --> 00:04:48,716
No, no. l'm not a teacher.
l'm a fraud.

1200
00:04:48,925 --> 00:04:51,416
No. You're not.

1201
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:56,430
You're a dedicated, talented teacher,
and those parents are gonna love you.

1202
00:04:56,634 --> 00:05:01,333
Just get in there and tell those parents
What you've been teaching their kids.

1203
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,074
Yeah, you knoW, math, English...

1204
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,910
What...? Science... What else?
Geography, history,

1205
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:14,709
Latin, Spanish, French,

1206
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:19,117
Latin... Math.
Did l say that already?

1207
00:05:19,322 --> 00:05:25,158
Anyway, all the stuff you Want your
kids to knoW, it's been covered, Ok?

1208
00:05:25,362 --> 00:05:27,160
So...

1209
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:32,665
...it Was great to meet you all,
and drive safe.

1210
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,235
Excuse me.

1211
00:05:34,437 --> 00:05:37,372
Since you started,
all my son talks about is music.

1212
00:05:37,574 --> 00:05:41,670
He says he Wants to be a musician.
ls this your influence?

1213
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:45,076
Why has my daughter become
obsessed With David Geffen?

1214
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:47,079
And hoW is this homeWork?

1215
00:05:47,384 --> 00:05:51,879
Ok, see, l Would like to tell you about
What We've been doing in here,

1216
00:05:52,088 --> 00:05:55,923
but there's such a thing as
teacher-student confidentiality,

1217
00:05:56,127 --> 00:05:59,119
and l don't Want to be in breach
of educational laW

1218
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:03,357
because l could be dismembered
by the teacher's union.

1219
00:06:03,634 --> 00:06:04,862
So...

1220
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:07,502
You expect us to believe
this garbage?

1221
00:06:08,773 --> 00:06:12,435
Mr. S, don't you think you should
tell them about the project?

1222
00:06:12,642 --> 00:06:14,872
What project?
Our class project.

1223
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:17,240
Every school in the state
is competing.

1224
00:06:17,447 --> 00:06:19,973
Competing?
lt's not till next quarter,

1225
00:06:20,184 --> 00:06:22,413
but Mr. S Wanted us
to get a head start.

1226
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,850
Well, What's the project, Summer?
lt's prestigious.

1227
00:06:26,057 --> 00:06:28,286
A Win Will go on our permanent record.

1228
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,892
You might as Well tell them,
Mr. Schneebly.

1229
00:06:33,096 --> 00:06:38,125
Ok, look. l've gotten to knoW your kids
the past feW Weeks. They're aWesome.

1230
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:42,567
Zack is an insane guitarist.
He's the next Hendrix, and he's 1 0.

1231
00:06:42,773 --> 00:06:44,899
And Gordon here, he's a genius!

1232
00:06:45,108 --> 00:06:49,637
He did a Whole professional light shoW
on his computer in three days. And...

1233
00:06:50,548 --> 00:06:52,846
And Marta here, she's...

1234
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,814
She can hit an A above high C.
Did you knoW that?

1235
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:59,456
Because that's tough.
Not many singers can do that. And...

1236
00:07:02,225 --> 00:07:06,458
Summer is gonna be the first Woman
president of the United States.

1237
00:07:06,663 --> 00:07:09,291
She could run this year.
l Would vote for her.

1238
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,300
Look, they're just really cool kids.
lf they Were mine, l Would be so proud.

1239
00:07:14,504 --> 00:07:18,497
And l am proud,
just to even knoW them. And...

1240
00:07:18,942 --> 00:07:21,673
Sir, can l see you in the hall
for a moment?

1241
00:07:22,278 --> 00:07:24,509
Let me just say
a couple more things.

1242
00:07:24,714 --> 00:07:27,047
What's going on?
What's happening?

1243
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,185
Apparently, that man
is not Ned Schneebly.

1244
00:07:30,588 --> 00:07:32,680
What?
What?

1245
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:35,983
This man is Ned Schneebly.
He's not even a teacher.

1246
00:07:36,192 --> 00:07:40,151
You called the cops?
She did. She got it out of me. Sorry.

1247
00:07:40,363 --> 00:07:43,855
You're apologizing to him?
Sorry.

1248
00:07:45,435 --> 00:07:47,062
Ned.

1249
00:07:48,605 --> 00:07:51,005
Ned, is this true?

1250
00:07:51,975 --> 00:07:53,237
Who are you?

1251
00:07:55,178 --> 00:07:57,511
My name is DeWey Finn.

1252
00:07:57,714 --> 00:08:03,084
And, no, l'm not a licensed teacher,
but l have been touched by your kids.

1253
00:08:03,286 --> 00:08:05,949
And l'm pretty sure l've touched them.

1254
00:08:12,963 --> 00:08:14,692
What?
Oh, my God.

1255
00:08:30,314 --> 00:08:33,806
l have nothing to say to you.
Me either.

1256
00:08:35,186 --> 00:08:37,779
Ok. l'm going to bed.

1257
00:08:38,022 --> 00:08:40,182
lt's one thing to throW
your life aWay,

1258
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,881
but to put Ned in jeopardy
is selfish.

1259
00:08:43,092 --> 00:08:45,527
You told me to be like Ned
and get a job.

1260
00:08:45,729 --> 00:08:49,164
l told you to be like Ned,
l didn't tell you to be Ned.

1261
00:08:49,365 --> 00:08:53,200
You're not gonna apologize?
You apologize for calling the cops.

1262
00:08:53,403 --> 00:08:56,498
l didn't murder anybody.
l Wanted to play a great shoW.

1263
00:08:56,706 --> 00:09:00,143
l Was this close.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

1264
00:09:00,344 --> 00:09:04,006
Would you both just cut it out
for one second?

1265
00:09:10,788 --> 00:09:14,052
Look, l'm sorry, dude.
l Was desperate.

1266
00:09:14,658 --> 00:09:17,091
lt Was easy for you to give up music.

1267
00:09:17,293 --> 00:09:20,821
lt ain't easy for me.
lt Wasn't easy for me.

1268
00:09:21,065 --> 00:09:22,429
l miss it.

1269
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:24,725
Well, then Why'd you give it up?

1270
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:27,768
Because l couldn't keep
kidding myself anymore.

1271
00:09:27,971 --> 00:09:30,941
You can blame it all on bad luck,
but in the end,

1272
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,506
maybe We just Weren't that good.

1273
00:09:34,177 --> 00:09:36,543
Sometimes you gotta knoW
When to quit.

1274
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,745
Right, maybe l suck.
That's not What l said.

1275
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,783
Well, music is my life, man.
What do you Want me to do?

1276
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:47,884
l don't knoW, but...

1277
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:50,457
...l think it's time you moved out.

1278
00:09:51,695 --> 00:09:53,219
Sorry.

1279
00:10:01,871 --> 00:10:06,969
So his name Wasn't Mr. Schneebly?
No, it Was, like, DeWey something.

1280
00:10:07,977 --> 00:10:09,445
What about the project?

1281
00:10:09,647 --> 00:10:12,047
Wake up, Marco,
there Was no project.

1282
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:15,308
He Wanted us to play a shoW
so We could make money.

1283
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,714
l can't believe We Weren't graded.

1284
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:20,788
Why are you bummed?
We had a three-Week vacation.

1285
00:10:21,158 --> 00:10:24,183
lt Was a Waste of time,
but it Was better than school.

1286
00:10:24,394 --> 00:10:28,524
lt Was not a Waste of time.
Yeah, that's What it Was.

1287
00:10:28,731 --> 00:10:30,393
You're an idiot.
Shut up.

1288
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,693
No, you shut up.
You Want to go?

1289
00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:35,837
Touch him, l'll shove those sticks
doWn your throat.

1290
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:40,739
Mr. S Was cool. We Worked too long
and too hard not to play the shoW.

1291
00:10:41,177 --> 00:10:43,202
Ok, so What are
We supposed to do?

1292
00:10:43,413 --> 00:10:45,779
We get out of here
and play the damn shoW.

1293
00:10:45,982 --> 00:10:49,179
HoW could you let our kids
be exposed to this impostor?

1294
00:10:49,385 --> 00:10:53,549
Do you just let anyone teach here?
l pay $1 5,000...

1295
00:10:53,756 --> 00:10:58,057
Let me assure you that nothing
is more important to us

1296
00:10:58,261 --> 00:11:02,392
than for you to feel your children
are in a safe and secure environment.

1297
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:17,706
Ok, We're all here.
Where's Mr. Schneebly?

1298
00:11:17,914 --> 00:11:21,407
He didn't tell you? He's at home.
We need to pick him up.

1299
00:11:21,618 --> 00:11:23,176
Let's go, hurry.

1300
00:11:29,326 --> 00:11:33,888
Excuse me.
Just one second, please.

1301
00:11:34,097 --> 00:11:37,033
Excuse me.
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

1302
00:11:37,234 --> 00:11:41,966
We Want some ansWers, noW!
Just one second!

1303
00:11:57,153 --> 00:12:02,114
Where did they go?
Help! Children?

1304
00:12:04,628 --> 00:12:06,220
Wake up.

1305
00:12:14,303 --> 00:12:18,240
HoW'd you guys get in here?
Front door Was open.

1306
00:12:19,176 --> 00:12:20,768
Why aren't you in school?

1307
00:12:20,977 --> 00:12:23,503
We did What you said.
We stuck it to The Man.

1308
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:27,081
Forget about What l told you.
Look, l'm a loser, Ok?

1309
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:31,116
You listen to my advice,
you'll end up like me, With nothing.

1310
00:12:31,687 --> 00:12:35,124
Come on, man, quit goofing around.
This is serious business.

1311
00:12:35,325 --> 00:12:38,488
We're on a mission. One great shoW
can change the World.

1312
00:12:41,365 --> 00:12:43,298
Look out the WindoW.

1313
00:12:50,407 --> 00:12:53,807
Mr. S! Come doWn!
Come on!

1314
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:58,311
No Way. That is so punk rock.

1315
00:13:01,418 --> 00:13:05,649
The dining-room table seats 1 4,
With no inserts...

1316
00:13:11,528 --> 00:13:15,658
What's going on?
We've got some rocking to do.

1317
00:13:27,711 --> 00:13:29,440
Yes!
All right.

1318
00:13:29,645 --> 00:13:32,638
Hi, Mr. Schneebly.
HoW's it going?

1319
00:13:34,684 --> 00:13:39,884
You guys, all l can say is,
let's rock.

1320
00:13:42,091 --> 00:13:47,359
One more thing.
l Want to say l'm sorry...

1321
00:13:47,563 --> 00:13:49,827

00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:53,869
l'm sorry l lied.

1323
00:13:54,136 --> 00:13:56,764
lt's not cool to lie to your band.
Come on.

1324
00:13:56,974 --> 00:14:00,067
We'll be late. There's no time
for apologies. Let's go!

1325
00:14:00,277 --> 00:14:01,835
All right. Let's go.

1326
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,642
Where are you going?

1327
00:14:05,849 --> 00:14:08,078
You Want to go?
Yeah, l Want to go.

1328
00:14:08,284 --> 00:14:11,254
You're serious?
l don't Want to miss this, Patty.

1329
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,548
Unbelievable. After everything
he's done to you?

1330
00:14:14,758 --> 00:14:18,318
That is so typical Ned. When Will you
stop being a pushover?

1331
00:14:18,528 --> 00:14:22,056
When are you finally gonna start
sticking up for yourself?

1332
00:14:27,104 --> 00:14:28,832
Excuse me.

1333
00:14:30,072 --> 00:14:32,370
Excuse me.

1334
00:14:32,576 --> 00:14:37,308
l've just been informed
that all of your children are missing.

1335
00:14:37,914 --> 00:14:40,440
So...
What?

1336
00:15:01,038 --> 00:15:02,562
Hey.
Can l help you?

1337
00:15:02,773 --> 00:15:05,105
We're competing.
We're the School of Rock.

1338
00:15:05,308 --> 00:15:07,903
You and the kids?
We're the band and creW.

1339
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,203
You'd better get in here.
Come on.

1340
00:15:10,413 --> 00:15:12,881
We're here.
You're late. You're up next.

1341
00:15:13,082 --> 00:15:16,575
Ok, We'll be ready. Come on.
Zack, check this out.

1342
00:15:16,787 --> 00:15:22,316
Whoa, it's aWesome.
Tears l can find on my oWn

1343
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:28,557
l'll take you there

1344
00:15:28,764 --> 00:15:30,664
l'll never...

1345
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:35,529
Don't listen to those hacks. Come on.
Band meeting. NoW. Gather round.

1346
00:15:35,739 --> 00:15:38,503
All right. Frankie, hoW's security?

1347
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,734
We're set.
What about the lights?

1348
00:15:40,943 --> 00:15:43,504
Light board's up in the balcony.
l'll patch it up.

1349
00:15:43,714 --> 00:15:45,306
Billy, hoW's beautification?

1350
00:15:45,514 --> 00:15:48,245
Are you kidding?
Ok, listen up, you guys,

1351
00:15:48,451 --> 00:15:51,784
We only have one song to let
these guys knoW Who We are.

1352
00:15:51,989 --> 00:15:54,957
So l think We should play Zack's.
But Why?

1353
00:15:55,158 --> 00:15:57,318
l mean, really?
Yes.

1354
00:15:57,628 --> 00:16:00,028
The thing is, you guys,
l ain't that good.

1355
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:04,188
l'm not. l can admit it. But you're 1 0,
and you're better than me.

1356
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,926
Your song rocks harder,
so let's play it.

1357
00:16:07,136 --> 00:16:09,900
But you knoW What?
That's just one guy's opinion.

1358
00:16:10,106 --> 00:16:13,235
This ain't my band, it's our band.
We all have a say.

1359
00:16:13,442 --> 00:16:17,379
We haven't practiced that one
as much. l mean, We might not Win.

1360
00:16:17,581 --> 00:16:21,711
Hey, We didn't come here to Win.
We came here to play one great shoW.

1361
00:16:21,918 --> 00:16:25,046
And on Zack's song,
you guys really rock.

1362
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,825
You knoW my vote,
Who else is With me?

1363
00:16:29,225 --> 00:16:31,216
All right, let's pray.

1364
00:16:31,427 --> 00:16:36,331
God of rock, thank you
for this chance to kick ass.

1365
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:39,696
We are your humble servants.
Please give us the poWer

1366
