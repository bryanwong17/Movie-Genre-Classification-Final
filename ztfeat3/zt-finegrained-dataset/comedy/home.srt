1
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:32,717
Listen to me, please.

2
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:36,763
You're like me, a Homo sapiens.

3
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,182
A wise human.

4
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:42,310
Life, a miracle in the universe,

5
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:45,605
appeared around
four billion years ago,

6
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,609
and we humans
only 200,000 years ago.

7
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:52,528
Yet we have succeeded
in disrupting the balance...

8
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,782
that is so essential to life on Earth.

9
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:59,786
Listen carefully to this
extraordinary story, which is yours,

10
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,039
and decide what
you want to do with it.

11
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:12,089
dd

12
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,277
These are traces of our origins.

13
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:37,532
At the beginning, our planet
was no more than a chaos of fire,

14
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:40,993
formed in the wake
of its star, the sun.

15
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,913
A cloud of agglutinated
dust particles,

16
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:48,501
similar to so many
similar clusters in the universe.

17
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,838
Yet this was where
the miracle of life occurred.

18
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,266
dd

19
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,155
Today, life- our life-

20
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,700
is just a link in a chain of
innumerable living beings...

21
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:08,164
that have succeeded one another
on Earth over nearly four billion years.

22
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:13,586
And even today, new volcanoes
continue to sculpt our landscapes.

23
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,548
They offer a glimpse of what
our Earth was like at its birth—

24
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:20,259
molten rock surging from the depths,

25
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:22,595
solidifying, cracking,

26
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,598
blistering or spreading
in a thin crust,

27
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,351
before falling dormant for a time.

28
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:46,285
These wreaths of smoke curling
from the bowels of the Earth...

29
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,789
bear witness to the Earth's
original atmosphere.

30
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,792
An atmosphere devoid of oxygen.

31
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:57,004
A dense atmosphere,
thick with water vapor,

32
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:59,548
full of carbon dioxide.

33
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,429
A furnace.

34
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:20,987
But the Earth had an exceptional
future, offered to it by water.

35
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:25,491
At the right distance from the sun—
not too far, not too near—

36
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:29,620
the Earth was able to
conserve water in liquid form.

37
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:36,585
Water vapor condensed and fell
in torrential downpours on Earth,

38
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,671
and rivers appeared.

39
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,643
The rivers shaped
the surface of the Earth,

40
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,854
cutting their channels,

41
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,981
furrowing out valleys.

42
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:00,985
They ran toward the lowest places
on the globe to form the oceans.

43
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,364
They tore minerals from the rocks,

44
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,075
and gradually the freshwater
of the oceans...

45
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,327
became heavy with salt.

46
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,172
Water is a vital liquid.

47
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:24,175
It irrigated these sterile expanses.

48
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,386
The paths it traced
are like the veins of a body,

49
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:32,308
the branches of a tree, the vessels of
the sap that it brought to the Earth.

50
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:44,570
dd

51
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:13,933
Nearly four billion years later,

52
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:17,353
somewhere on Earth
can still be found these works of art,

53
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:22,525
left by the volcanoes' ash, mixed
with water from Iceland's glaciers.

54
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,128
There they are- matter and water,

55
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,171
water and matter-

56
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:50,177
soft and hard combined, the crucial alliance
shared by every life-form on our planet.

57
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,263
dd

58
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:09,446
Minerals and metals
are even older than the Earth.

59
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,532
They are stardust.

60
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,868
They provide the Earth's colors.

61
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:25,421
Red from iron, black from carbon,

62
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:29,091
blue from copper, yellow from sulfur.

63
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,286
Where do we come from?

64
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,039
Where did life first spark into being?

65
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,751
A miracle of time,

66
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:07,963
primitive life-forms still exist
in the globe's hot springs.

67
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,759
They give them their colors.

68
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:14,303
They're called archaeobacteria.

69
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,229
They all feed off the Earth's heat-

70
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:28,317
all except the cyanobacteria,
or blue-green algae.

71
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:36,784
They alone have the capacity to turn
to the sun to capture its energy.

72
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:46,835
They are a vital ancestor of all
yesterday's and today's plant species.

73
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,381
These tiny bacteria...

74
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,675
and their billions of descendants...

75
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,095
changed the destiny of our planet.

76
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,014
They transformed its atmosphere.

77
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:08,274
What happened to the carbon
that poisoned the atmosphere?

78
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:12,528
It's still here,
imprisoned in the Earth's crust.

79
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,905
We can read this chapter
of the Earth's history...

80
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,784
nowhere better than on the walls
of Colorado's Grand Canyon.

81
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:22,705
They reveal nearly two billion years
of the Earth's history.

82
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:27,710
Once upon a time, the Grand Canyon
was a sea inhabited by microorganisms.

83
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:32,298
They grew their shells by tapping into
carbon from the atmosphere...

84
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,633
dissolved in the ocean.

85
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:37,553
When they died, the shells sank...

86
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,222
and accumulated on the seabed.

87
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:46,645
These strata are the product of those
billions and billions of shells.

88
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,616
Thanks to them, the carbon
drained from the atmosphere,

89
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:02,077
and other life-forms could develop.

90
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,595
It is life that altered the atmosphere.

91
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,057
Plant life fed off the sun's energy,

92
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,726
which enabled it to break apart
the water molecule...

93
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,728
and take the oxygen.

94
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,689
And oxygen filled the air.

95
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:45,579
The Earth's water cycle
is a process of constant renewal.

96
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,624
Waterfalls, water vapor,

97
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,294
clouds, rain, springs,

98
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:57,633
rivers, seas, oceans, glaciers.

99
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,718
The cycle is never broken.

100
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:03,389
There's always the same
quantity of water on Earth.

101
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:08,560
All the successive species on Earth
have drunk the same water.

102
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:12,898
The astonishing matter that is water.

103
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,192
One of the most unstable of all.

104
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,778
It takes a liquid form
as running water,

105
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,780
gaseous as vapor...

106
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,533
or solid as ice.

107
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:35,087
In Siberia, the frozen surfaces
of the lakes in winter...

108
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:40,717
contain the traces of the forces
that water deploys when it freezes.

109
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,220
Lighter than water, the ice floats,

110
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,431
rather than sinking to the bottom.

111
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,684
It forms a protective mantle
against the cold,

112
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,019
under which life can go on.

113
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:37,149
The engine of life is linkage.

114
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,318
Everything is linked.

115
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,862
Nothing is self-sufficient.

116
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,156
Water and air are inseparable,

117
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,160
united in life
and for our life on Earth.

118
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:58,795
Thus, clouds form over the oceans
and bring rain to the landmasses,

119
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,007
whose rivers carry water
back to the oceans.

120
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,468
Sharing is everything.

121
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:18,690
The green expanse peeking through the
clouds is the source of oxygen in the air.

122
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:23,862
Seventy percent of this gas, without
which our lungs cannot function,

123
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:28,242
comes from the algae
that tint the surface of the oceans.

124
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,871
Our Earth relies on a balance...

125
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,707
in which every being
has a role to play...

126
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:39,753
and exists only through
the existence of another being.

127
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:45,717
A subtle, fragile harmony
that is easily shattered.

128
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:51,014
Thus, corals are born
from the marriage of algae and shells.

129
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:54,726
The Great Barrier Reef,
off the coast of Australia,

130
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:58,855
stretches over
350,000 square kilometers...

131
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,734
and is home to 1,500 species of fish,

132
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,237
4,000 species of mollusks...

133
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,407
and 400 species of coral.

134
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:13,120
The equilibrium of every ocean
depends on these corals.

135
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:38,895
The Earth counts time
in billions of years.

136
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,108
It took more than four billion years
for it to make trees.

137
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,655
In the chain of species,

138
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,782
trees are a pinnacle,

139
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,952
a perfect living sculpture.

140
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,079
Trees defy gravity.

141
00:15:56,164 --> 00:16:02,002
They are the only natural element
in perpetual movement toward the sky.

142
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:07,049
They grow unhurriedly toward the sun
that nourishes their foliage.

143
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:31,698
They have inherited from those
minuscule cyanobacteria...

144
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:35,035
the power to capture light's energy.

145
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,246
They store it and feed off it,

146
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,957
turning it into wood and leaves,

147
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:44,336
which then decompose
into a mixture of water,

148
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,923
mineral, vegetable and living matter.

149
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,009
And so, gradually,

150
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:55,764
the soils that are indispensable
to life are formed.

151
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:07,275
Soils are the factory of biodiversity.

152
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,071
They are a world
of incessant activity...

153
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:16,201
where microorganisms feed,
dig, aerate and transform.

154
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:21,957
They make the humus, the fertile layer
to which all life on land is linked.

155
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:44,771
What do we know about life on Earth?

156
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:47,107
How many species are we aware of?

157
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,777
A 1 Oth of them? A hundredth perhaps?

158
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:53,905
What do we know about
the bonds that link them?

159
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,285
The Earth is a miracle.

160
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,412
Life remains a mystery.

161
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:04,958

162
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:16,636
dd

163
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,100
Families of animals form,

164
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:26,271
united by customs and rituals
that survive today.

165
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:32,402
dd

166
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:50,629
Some adapt to the nature
of their pasture,

167
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,465
and their pasture adapts to them.

168
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,509
And both gain.

169
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:59,805
The animal sates its hunger,
and the tree can blossom again.

170
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:05,519
dd

171
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,641
In the great adventure
of life on Earth,

172
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,935
every species has a role to play,

173
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,563
every species has its place.

174
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:53,608
None is futile or harmful.

175
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:56,528
They all balance out.

176
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,211
And that's where you,

177
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:16,214
Homo sapiens- "wise human"-

178
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,341
enter the story.

179
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,178
You benefit from a fabulous...

180
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:26,975
four-billion-year-old legacy
bequeathed by the Earth.

181
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,519
dd

182
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,276
You're only 200,000 years old,

183
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,279
but you have changed
the face of the world.

184
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,283
Despite your vulnerability,

185
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,244
you have taken possession
of every habitat...

186
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:49,122
and conquered swaths of territory...

187
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,875
like no other species before you.

188
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,210
dd

189
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,682
After 180,000 nomadic years,

190
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:11,645
and thanks to a more clement climate,
humans settled down.

191
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:15,732
They no longer depended on
hunting for survival.

192
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,901
They chose to live
in wet environments...

193
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:22,238
that abounded
in fish, game and wild plants.

194
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:25,909
There, where land,
water and life combine.

195
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,036
dd

196
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:38,421
Human genius inspired them
to build canoes,

197
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:43,051
an invention that
opened up new horizons...

198
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:46,388
and turned humans into navigators.

199
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:00,568
dd

200
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,423
Even today,
the majority of humankind...

201
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,425
lives on the continents' coastlines...

202
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:26,177
or the banks of rivers and lakes.

203
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:05,842
The first towns grew up
less than 600 years ago.

204
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:09,721
It was a considerable leap
in human history.

205
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:14,893
Why towns? Because they allowed humans
to defend themselves more easily.

206
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:17,020
They became social beings,

207
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,731
meeting and sharing
knowledge and crafts,

208
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,609
blending their similarities
and differences.

209
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:26,112
In a word, they became civilized.

210
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:14,661
But the only energy at their disposal
was provided by nature...

211
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:17,455
and the strength of their bodies.

212
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:21,626
It was the story of humankind
for thousands of years.

213
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,171
It still is for one person in four-

214
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:28,299
over one and a half billion
human beings-

215
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:32,971
more than the combined
population of all the wealthy nations.

216
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:51,281
Taking from the Earth
only the strictly necessary.

217
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:55,368
For a long time, the relationship
between humans and the planet...

218
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,495
was evenly balanced.

219
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:03,251
For a long time, the economy seemed
like a natural and equitable alliance.

220
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:23,521
But life expectancy is short,
and hard labor takes its toll.

221
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:28,026
The uncertainties of nature
weigh on daily life.

222
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,654
Education is a rare privilege.

223
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:35,158
Children are a family's only asset,

224
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,493
as long as every
extra pair of hands...

225
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:41,247
is a necessary contribution
to its subsistence.

226
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:55,220
The Earth feeds people,
clothes them...

227
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,222
and provides for their daily needs.

228
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:00,183
Everything comes from the Earth.

229
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:12,820
Towns change humanity's nature,
as well as its destiny.

230
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:16,658
The farmer becomes a craftsman,
trader or peddler.

231
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:27,252
What the Earth gives the farmer,
the city dweller buys, sells or barters.

232
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,545
Goods change hands,

233
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,631
along with ideas.

234
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:51,943
Humanity's genius is to have always
had a sense of its weakness.

235
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:55,488
Humans tried to extend
the frontiers of their territory,

236
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,532
but they knew their limits.

237
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:02,161
The physical energy and strength with
which nature had not endowed them...

238
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:05,915
was found in the animals
they domesticated to serve them.

239
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,687
But how can you conquer
the world on an empty stomach?

240
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,023
The invention of agriculture...

241
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:34,652
transformed the future of the wild
animals scavenging for food...

242
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:36,696
that were humankind.

243
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:41,993
Agriculture turned
their history on end.

244
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:46,080
Agriculture was
their first great revolution.

245
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:49,500
Developed barely
8,000 to 10,000 years ago,

246
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:52,420
it changed
their relationship to nature.

247
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:03,681
It brought an end to the uncertainty
of hunting and gathering.

248
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:06,768
It resulted in the first surpluses...

249
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:09,562
and gave birth to cities
and civilizations.

250
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,153
For their agriculture,

251
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:20,990
humans harnessed the energy
of animal species and plant life,

252
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:24,077
from which they at last
extracted the profits.

253
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:29,040
The memory of thousands of years
scrabbling for food faded.

254
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:32,502
They learned to adapt the grains
that are the yeast of life...

255
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:35,505
to different soils and climates.

256
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:40,510
They learned to increase the yield
and multiply the number of varieties.

257
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,771
Like every species on Earth,

258
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,899
the principal
daily concern of all humans...

259
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:58,861
is to feed themselves
and their family.

260
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:02,907
When the soil is less generous
and water becomes scarce,

261
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:07,912
humans deploy prodigious efforts
to mark a few arid acres...

262
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,706
with the imprint of their labor.

263
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:33,396
Humans shaped the land with the patience
and devotion that the Earth demands,

264
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,025
in an almost sacrificial ritual
performed over and over.

265
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:07,013
Agriculture is still the world's
most widespread occupation.

266
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:11,642
Half of humankind tills the soil,

267
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:15,271
over three-quarters of them by hand.

268
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:18,900
Agriculture is like
a tradition handed down...

269
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:23,613
from generation to generation
in sweat, graft and toil,

270
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:28,117
because for humanity it is
a prerequisite of survival.

271
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:31,746
But after relying on
muscle power for so long,

272
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:36,918
humankind found a way to tap into
the energy buried deep in the Earth.

273
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,132
These flames are also from plants.

274
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:45,134
A pocket of sunlight.

275
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:47,929
Pure energy— the energy of the sun—

276
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:51,307
captured over millions of years
by millions of plants...

277
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:54,018
more than a hundred million years ago.

278
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,771
It's coal. It's gas.

279
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,524
And above all, it's oil.

280
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:34,308
And this pocket of sunlight freed
humans from their toil on the land.

281
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:43,859
With oil began the era of humans
who break free of the shackles of time.

282
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:48,155
With oil, some of us acquired
unprecedented comforts.

283
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,908
And in 50 years, in a single lifetime,

284
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:53,286
the Earth has been
more radically changed...

285
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:57,039
than by all previous
generations of humanity.

286
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,627
Faster and faster.

287
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:06,048
In the last 60 years, the Earth's
population has almost tripled,

288
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:10,052
and over two billion people
have moved to the cities.

289
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:17,184
Faster and faster.

290
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:21,522
Shenzhen, in China, with its hundreds of
skyscrapers and millions of inhabitants,

291
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:26,277
was just a small fishing village
barely 40 years ago.

292
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,450
Faster and faster.

293
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:35,953
In Shanghai,
3,000 towers and skyscrapers...

294
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:38,748
have been built in 20 years.

295
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,875
Hundreds more are under construction.

296
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:53,512
Today, over half of the world's
seven billion inhabitants live in cities.

297
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:07,568
New York.
The world's first megalopolis...

298
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:10,488
is the symbol of the exploitation
of the energy...

299
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:13,699
the Earth supplies to human genius.

300
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:16,327
The manpower
of millions of immigrants,

301
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,329
the energy of coal,

302
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,540
the unbridled power of oil.

303
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:24,377
Electricity resulted
in the invention of elevators,

304
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:28,255
which in turn permitted
the invention of skyscrapers.

305
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,968
New York ranks as the 16th-largest
economy in the world.

306
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:41,060
America was the first
to discover, exploit and harness...

307
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,980
the phenomenal revolutionary
power of black gold.

308
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:47,441
With its help,

309
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:52,363
a country of farmers became a country
of agricultural industrialists.

310
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:55,574
Machines replaced men.

311
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:58,494
A liter of oil generates
as much energy...

312
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:02,206
as 100 pairs of hands in 24 hours,

313
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:07,670
but worldwide only three percent
of farmers have use of a tractor.

314
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:12,466
Nonetheless, their output
dominates the planet.

315
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:16,595
In the United States,
only three million farmers are left.

316
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:21,142
They produce enough grain
to feed two billion people.

317
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:29,358
But most of that grain
is not used to feed people.

318
00:34:29,443 --> 00:34:33,154
Here, and in all other
industrialized nations,

319
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:37,533
it's transformed
into livestock feed or biofuels.

320
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,293
The pocket of sunshine's energy...

321
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:51,797
chased away the specter of drought
that stalked farmland.

322
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:55,050
No spring escapes
the demands of agriculture,

323
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:59,388
which accounts for
70% of humanity's water consumption.

324
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:06,437
In nature, everything is linked.

325
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,815
The expansion of cultivated land
and single-crop farming...

326
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,860
encouraged the development
of parasites.

327
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:17,156
Pesticides, another gift of
the petrochemical revolution,

328
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,450
exterminated them.

329
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:24,205
Bad harvests and famine
became a distant memory.

330
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,207
The biggest headache now...

331
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:30,419
was what to do with the surpluses
engendered by modern agriculture.

332
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:45,226
But toxic pesticides
seeped into the air,

333
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,813
soil, plants, animals,
rivers and oceans.

334
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:51,273
They penetrated the heart of cells...

335
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:56,487
similar to the mother cell
that is shared by all forms of life.

336
00:35:56,571 --> 00:36:00,074
Are they harmful to the humans
that they released from hunger?

337
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,994
These farmers,
in their yellow protective suits,

338
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,288
probably have a good idea.

339
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:26,141
The new agriculture abolished
the dependence on soils and seasons.

340
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:33,983
Fertilizers produced
unprecedented results...

341
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:37,653
on plots of land thus far ignored.

342
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,573
Crops adapted to soils and climates...

343
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:45,286
gave way to the most productive
varieties and the easiest to transport.

344
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,371
And so, in the last century,

345
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:52,376
three-quarters of the varieties developed
by farmers over thousands of years...

346
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,713
have been wiped out.

347
00:36:55,797 --> 00:37:00,509
As far as the eye can see,
fertilizer below, plastic on top.

348
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:03,470
The greenhouses of Almeria in Spain...

349
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,681
are Europe's vegetable garden.

350
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,726
A city of uniformly sized
vegetables...

351
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,729
waits every day
for the hundreds of trucks...

352
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:14,815
that will take them
to the continent's supermarkets.

353
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,068
The more a country develops,

354
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:21,238
the more meat its inhabitants consume.

355
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:24,575
How can growing worldwide
demand be satisfied...

356
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:28,746
without recourse to concentration
camp-style cattle farms?

357
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,748
Faster and faster.

358
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:34,251
Like the life cycle of livestock
which may never see a meadow,

359
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:39,298
manufacturing meat faster than
the animal has become a daily routine.

360
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:53,729
In these vast food lots,
trampled by millions of cattle,

361
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:56,023
not a blade of grass grows.

362
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,818
A fleet of trucks from
every corner of the country...

363
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:02,696
brings in tons of grain, soy meal...

364
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:07,534
and protein-rich granules
that will become tons of meat.

365
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:11,330
The result is that it takes
100 liters of water...

366
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:14,333
to produce one kilogram of potatoes,

367
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,544
4,000 for one kilo of rice...

368
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:21,882
and 13,000 for one kilo of beef.

369
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:25,886
Not to mention the oil guzzled in
the production process and transport.

370
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:38,983
Our agriculture
has become oil-powered.

371
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:41,694
It feeds twice as many
humans on Earth...

372
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:46,657
but has replaced diversity
with standardization.

373
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:50,327
It has offered many of us
comforts we could only dream of,

374
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:54,873
but it makes our way of life
totally dependent on oil.

375
00:38:56,918 --> 00:39:00,379
This is the new measure of time.

376
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,090
Our world's clock
now beats to the rhythm...

377
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,134
of these indefatigable machines...

378
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:08,637
tapping into the pocket of sunlight.

379
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:11,682
Their regularity reassures us.

380
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:15,602
The tiniest hiccup
throws us into disarray.

381
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:19,273
The whole planet is attentive
to these metronomes...

382
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,860
of our hopes and illusions.

383
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:26,989
The same hopes and illusions
that proliferate along with our needs,

384
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:30,868
increasingly insatiable desires
and profligacy.

385
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:33,996
We know that the end
of cheap oil is imminent,

386
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,290
but we refuse to believe it.

387
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:46,967
For many of us, the American dream
is embodied by a legendary name:

388
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:50,054
Los Angeles.

389
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:53,390
In this city that stretches
over 100 kilometers,

390
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:57,811
the number of cars is almost
equal to the number of inhabitants.

391
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:13,327
Here, energy puts on
a fantastic show every night.

392
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:50,906
The days seem to be no more
than the pale reflection of nights...

393
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,951
that turn the city into a starry sky.

394
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:59,832
Faster and faster.

395
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:03,961
Distances are no longer counted
in miles but in minutes.

396
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:07,965
The automobile shapes new suburbs
where every home is a castle,

397
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:11,468
a safe distance from
the asphyxiated city centers,

398
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:15,389
and where neat rows of houses
huddle round dead-end streets.

399
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,767
The model of a lucky few countries...

400
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:20,811
has become a universal dream,

401
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:24,314
preached by televisions
all over the world.

402
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:30,654
Even here in Beijing,

403
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,365
it is cloned, copied and reproduced...

404
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:38,412
in these formatted houses
that have wiped pagodas off the map.

405
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:56,180
The automobile has become
the symbol of comfort and progress.

406
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,726
If this model were followed
by every society,

407
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:05,522
the planet wouldn't have 900
million vehicles, as it does today,

408
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:07,983
but five billion.

409
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:17,326
Faster and faster.

410
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:21,538
The more the world develops,
the greater its thirst for energy.

411
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:26,251
Everywhere, machines dig,
bore and rip from the Earth...

412
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:30,464
the pieces of stars buried in
its depths since its creation:

413
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,549
minerals.

414
00:42:56,032 --> 00:43:00,244
In the next 20 years, more ore
will be extracted from the Earth...

415
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:03,330
than in the whole
of humanity's history.

416
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:06,625
As a privilege of power,

417
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,961
80% of this mineral wealth...

418
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:13,423
is consumed by 20%
of the world's population.

419
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:33,860
Before the end of this century,

420
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:38,657
excessive mining will have exhausted
nearly all the planet's reserves.

421
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:50,460
Faster and faster.

422
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,879
Shipyards churn out oil tankers,

423
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:55,132
container ships and gas tankers...

424
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:59,219
to cater for the demands
of globalized industrial production.

425
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:06,893
Most consumer goods travel
thousands of kilometers...

426
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:11,565
from the country of production
to the country of consumption.

427
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,985
Since 1950,
the volume of international trade...

428
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,863
has increased 20 times over.

429
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:32,002
Ninety percent of trade goes by sea.

430
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:37,424
500 million containers
are transported every year,

431
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,510
headed for the world's
major hubs of consumption,

432
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:42,596
such as Dubai.

433
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:48,268
Dubai is one of the biggest
construction sites in the world—

434
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:51,605
a country where the impossible
becomes possible.

435
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:55,067
Building artificial islands
in the sea, for example.

436
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,766
Dubai has few natural resources,

437
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:31,978
but with the money from oil, it can bring
millions of tons of material and people...

438
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,980
from all over the world.

439
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:38,360
It can build forests of skyscrapers,
each one taller than the last,

440
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:41,530
or even a ski slope
in the middle of the desert.

441
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:46,118
Dubai has no farmland,
but it can import food.

442
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,120
Dubai has no water,

443
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:51,248
but it can afford to expend
immense amounts of energy...

444
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:56,169
to desalinate seawater and build
the highest skyscrapers in the world.

445
00:45:56,254 --> 00:46:00,632
Dubai has endless sun
but no solar panels.

446
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:03,635
It is the city of more is more,

447
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,263
where the wildest dreams
become reality.

448
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:09,683
Dubai is a sort of culmination
of the Western model,

449
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:13,395
with its 800-meter high totem
to total modernity...

450
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:16,189
that never fails to amaze the world.

451
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:19,484
Excessive? Perhaps.

452
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:22,404
Dubai appears to have made its choice.

453
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:25,490
It is like the new beacon
for all the world's money.

454
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:41,631
Nothing seems further removed
from nature than Dubai,

455
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:45,719
although nothing depends
on nature more than Dubai.

456
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:51,057
The city merely follows
the model of wealthy nations.

457
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:55,437
We haven't understood that we're
depleting what nature provides.

458
00:46:55,605 --> 00:46:58,732
dd

459
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:44,361
What do we know of the marine world,
of which we see only the surface,

460
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:47,948
and which covers
three-quarters of the planet?

461
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:50,742
The ocean depths remain a secret.

462
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:55,956
They contain thousands of species
whose existence remains a mystery to us.

463
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:01,753
dd

464
00:48:11,264 --> 00:48:16,184
Since 1950, fishing catches
have increased fivefold,

465
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:20,981
from 18 to 100 million
metric tons a year.

466
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:24,985
Thousands of factory ships
are emptying the oceans.

467
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:36,413
Three-quarters
of fishing grounds are exhausted,

468
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:39,624
depleted or in danger of being so.

469
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:22,459
Most large fish have been
fished out of existence,

470
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:25,587
since they have no time to reproduce.

471
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:29,883
We are destroying the cycle of a life
that was given to us.

472
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:45,899
On the coastlines, signs of
the exhaustion of stocks abound.

473
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,944
First sign: Colonies of sea
mammals are getting smaller.

474
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:53,823
Made vulnerable by urbanization
of the coasts and pollution,

475
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:57,077
they now face a new threat: famine.

476
00:49:57,161 --> 00:50:00,664
In their unequal battle
against industrial fishing fleets,

477
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:03,750
they can't find enough fish
to feed their young.

478
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:08,963
dd

479
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,719
Second sign:

480
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:18,848
Seabirds must fly ever greater
distances to find food.

481
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:24,771
At the current rate, all fish stocks
are threatened with exhaustion.

482
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:30,819
dd

483
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:40,704
In Dakar, traditional net fishing
boomed in the years of plenty,

484
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:43,832
but today, fish stocks are dwindling.

485
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:51,673
dd

486
00:51:03,728 --> 00:51:07,897
Fish is the staple diet
of one in five humans.

487
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:23,580
dd

488
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:38,136
Can we envision the inconceivable?

489
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,388
Abandoned boats,

490
00:51:40,473 --> 00:51:42,557
seas devoid offish?

491
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:48,354
dd

492
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:11,377
We have forgotten
that resources are scarce.

493
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:15,298
500 million humans live
in the world's desert lands,

494
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,967
more than the combined
population of Europe.

495
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:20,970
They know the value of water.

496
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:23,431
They know how to use it sparingly.

497
00:52:23,516 --> 00:52:27,393
Here, they depend on wells
replenished by fossil water,

498
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:31,981
which accumulated underground in the
days when it rained on these deserts,

499
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:34,567
25,000 years ago.

500
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:44,994
Fossil water also enables crops
to be grown in the desert...

501
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:47,831
to provide food for local populations.

502
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:49,916
The fields' circular shape...

503
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,420
derives from the pipes that
irrigate them around a central pivot.

504
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:12,230
But there is a heavy price to pay.

505
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:15,984
Fossil water
is a nonrenewable resource.

506
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:29,122
In Saudi Arabia, the dream of industrial
farming in the desert has faded.

507
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,249
As if on a parchment map,

508
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:35,628
the light spots on this patchwork
show abandoned plots.

509
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:38,339
The irrigation equipment
is still there.

510
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:40,717
The energy to pump water also.

511
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:44,804
But the fossil water reserves
are severely depleted.

512
00:53:57,318 --> 00:54:00,778
Israel turned the desert
into arable land.

513
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:04,532
Even though these hothouses
are now irrigated drop by drop,

514
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:08,786
water consumption continues
to increase along with exports.

515
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:20,423
The once mighty river Jordan
is now just a trickle.

516
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:23,551
Its water has flown to supermarkets
all over the world...

517
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:26,346
in crates of fruit and vegetables.

518
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:03,591
The Jordan's fate is not unique.

519
00:55:03,676 --> 00:55:07,387
Across the planet,
one major river in 10...

520
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:11,349
no longer flows into the sea
for several months of the year.

521
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:26,322
The Dead Sea derives its name
from its incredibly high salinity...

522
00:55:26,407 --> 00:55:28,574
that makes all life impossible.

523
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,952
Deprived of the Jordan's water,

524
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:34,372
its level goes down
by over one meter per year.

525
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:37,083
Its salinity is increasing.

526
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,168
Evaporation, due to the heat,

527
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:42,338
produces these fine islands
of salt evaporites-

528
00:55:42,423 --> 00:55:44,424
beautiful but sterile.

529
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:13,077
In Rajasthan, India,
Udaipur is a miracle of water.

530
00:56:13,162 --> 00:56:17,081
The city was made possible
by a system of dams and channels...

531
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:19,417
that created an artificial lake.

532
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:23,671
For its architects,
was water so precious...

533
00:56:23,756 --> 00:56:26,299
that they dedicated a palace to it?

534
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:54,494
India risks being the country
that suffers most...

535
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:57,663
from the lack of water
in the coming century.

536
00:56:57,748 --> 00:57:01,459
Massive irrigation
has fed the growing population,

537
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:07,423
and in the last 50 years,
21 million wells have been dug.

538
00:57:07,508 --> 00:57:10,802
The victory over famine
has a downside, however.

539
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:16,474
In many parts of the country, the drill
has to sink ever deeper to hit water.

540
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:19,018
In western India,

541
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:21,687
30% of wells have been abandoned.

542
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:30,696
The underground
aquifers are drying out.

543
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:55,763
Vast reservoirs will catch the monsoon
rains to replenish the aquifers.

544
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:05,481
In dry season, women from local
villages dig them with their bare hands.

545
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:32,008
Thousands of kilometers away,

546
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:34,010
800 to 1,000 liters of water...

547
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:38,181
are consumed per person per day.

548
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:41,225
Las Vegas was built out of the desert.

549
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:43,769
Millions of people live there.

550
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:46,689
Thousands more arrive every month.

551
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:52,195
The inhabitants of Las Vegas are among the
biggest consumers of water in the world.

552
00:58:58,118 --> 00:59:00,036
Palm Springs is another desert city...

553
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:03,581
with tropical vegetation
and lush golf courses.

554
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:24,644
How long can this mirage
continue to prosper?

555
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:34,737
The Earth cannot keep up.

556
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:38,199
The Colorado River,
which brings water to these cities,

557
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:41,452
is one of those rivers
that no longer reaches the sea.

558
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,996
Even more alarmingly,

559
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:47,291
its flow is diminishing at source.

560
00:59:47,376 --> 00:59:51,170
Water levels in the catchment lakes
along its course...

561
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:54,131
are plummeting.

562
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:58,552
Lake Powell took 17 years
to reach high-water mark.

563
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:01,889
Its level is now half of that.

564
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:06,435
Water shortages could affect
nearly two billion people...

565
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,521
before 2025.

566
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:13,859
Yet water is still abundant
in unspoiled regions of the planet.

567
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:19,282
The wetlands.

568
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:34,297
These wetlands are crucial
to all life on Earth.

569
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:37,383
They represent
six percent of the planet.

570
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:43,681
Marshes are sponges
that regulate the flow of water.

571
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:48,477
They absorb it in the wet season...

572
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:51,272
and release it in the dry season.

573
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:08,581
The water runs off the mountain peaks,

574
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:12,668
carrying with it the seeds
of the regions it flows through.

575
01:01:12,753 --> 01:01:15,588
This process gives birth
to unique landscapes,

576
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:20,009
where the diversity of species
is unequaled in its richness.

577
01:01:24,598 --> 01:01:28,184
Under the calm water
lies a veritable factory...

578
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:31,437
where this ultimately linked
richness and diversity...

579
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:36,067
patiently filters the water
and digests all the pollution.

580
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:38,486
Marshes are
indispensable environments...

581
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:42,531
for the regeneration
and purification of water.

582
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:59,215
These wetlands were always seen
as unhealthy expanses,

583
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:02,093
unfit for human habitation.

584
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:04,387
In our race to conquer more land,

585
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:08,057
we have reclaimed them
as pasture for our livestock,

586
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:11,894
or as land for agriculture
or building.

587
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:37,044
In the last century, half of
the world's marshes were drained.

588
01:02:37,129 --> 01:02:41,549
We know neither their richness
nor their role.

589
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,764
All living matter is linked.

590
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:51,434
dd

591
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:56,272
Water, air, soil, trees.

592
01:02:56,356 --> 01:03:00,192
The world's magic
is right in front of our eyes.

593
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:11,120
dd

594
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:38,772
Trees breathe groundwater
into the atmosphere as light mist.

595
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:42,443
They form a canopy that alleviates
the impact of heavy rains...

596
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:45,362
and protects the soil from erosion.

597
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:52,703
The forests provide the humidity
that is necessary for life.

598
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:56,832
They are the mother
and father of rain.

599
01:03:56,917 --> 01:04:00,461
dd

600
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:03,839
The forests store carbon.

601
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:07,551
They contain more than
all the Earth's atmosphere.

602
01:04:07,636 --> 01:04:10,513
They are the cornerstone
of the climatic balance...

603
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:14,350
on which we all depend.

604
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:17,645
dd

605
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:27,363
Trees provide a habitat for three-quarters
of the planet's biodiversity—

606
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:31,534
that is to say, of all life on Earth.

607
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:36,872
Every year, we discover new species
we had no idea existed—

608
01:04:36,957 --> 01:04:40,167
insects, birds, mammals.

609
01:04:40,252 --> 01:04:44,296
dd

610
01:04:57,060 --> 01:05:00,354
dd

611
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:16,245
These forests provide
the remedies that cure us.

612
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:18,747
The substances secreted
by these plants...

613
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:21,417
can be recognized by our bodies.

614
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:24,253
Our cells talk the same language.

615
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:27,464
We are of the same family.

616
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:30,509
dd

617
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:45,733
dd

618
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:55,075
Mangroves are forests
that step out onto the sea.

619
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:59,204
Like coral reefs,
they are a nursery for the oceans.

620
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:02,499
Their roots entwine
and form a shelter for the fish...

621
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:05,544
and mollusks that come to breed.

622
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:08,047
Mangroves protect the coasts
from hurricanes,

623
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:10,883
tidal waves and erosion by the sea.

624
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,719
Whole peoples depend on them.

625
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:19,099
Yet, they were reduced by half
during the 20th century.

626
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,731
One of the reasons
for the ongoing disaster...

627
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:30,152
is these shrimp farms installed
on the mangroves' rich waters.

628
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:33,864
Ventilators aerate pools
full of antibiotics...

629
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:36,575
to prevent the asphyxiation
of the shrimps,

630
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,994
not that of the mangroves.

631
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:50,005
Since the 1960s, deforestation
has constantly gathered pace.

632
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:54,259
Every year, 13 million hectares
of tropical forest-

633
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:56,595
an area the size of Illinois-

634
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:00,265
disappear in smoke and as lumber.

635
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:11,193
The world's largest rain forest,
the Amazon,

636
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:14,655
has already been reduced by 20%.

637
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:18,867
The forest gives way
to cattle ranches or soybean farms.

638
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:21,120
Ninety-five percent
of these soybeans...

639
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:26,125
are used to feed livestock
and poultry in Europe and Asia.

640
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:39,930
And so, a forest is turned into meat.

641
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:50,524
When they burn,
forests and their soils...

642
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:52,901
release huge quantities of carbon,

643
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:58,574
accounting for 20% of the greenhouse
gases emitted across the globe.

644
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:03,078
Deforestation is one of the principal
causes of global warming.

645
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:17,718
Thousands of species
disappear forever.

646
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:22,973
With them, one of the links
in a long chain of evolution snaps.

647
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:26,393
The intelligence of the living matter
from which they came...

648
01:08:26,478 --> 01:08:28,479
is lost forever.

649
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:48,582
Barely 20 years ago, Borneo,
the fourth-largest island in the world,

650
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:52,169
was covered by a vast primary forest.

651
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:54,671
At the current rate of deforestation,

652
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:58,217
it will have totally
disappeared within 10 years.

653
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:04,139
Living matter bonds water,
air, earth and the sun.

654
01:09:04,224 --> 01:09:07,059
In Borneo,
this bond has been broken...

655
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:11,438
in what was one of the Earth's
greatest reservoirs of biodiversity.

656
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:29,164
This catastrophe was
provoked by the decision...

657
01:09:29,249 --> 01:09:31,291
to produce palm oil,

658
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:35,003
the most consumed oil
in the world, on Borneo.

659
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:39,216
Palm oil not only caters
to our growing demand for food,

660
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:44,763
but also cosmetics, detergents
and, increasingly, alternative fuels.

661
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:53,897
The forest diversity was replaced
by a single species- the oil palm.

662
01:09:53,982 --> 01:09:57,860
Mono culture is easy,
productive and rapid.

663
01:09:57,944 --> 01:10:00,904
For local people,
it provides employment.

664
01:10:00,989 --> 01:10:03,448
It is an agricultural industry.

665
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:16,920
Another example of massive
deforestation is the eucalyptus.

666
01:10:17,005 --> 01:10:19,756
Eucalyptus is used to make paper pulp.

667
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:25,512
Plantations are growing, as demand for
paper has increased fivefold in 50 years.

668
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:36,106
Mono cultures of trees
are gaining ground all over the world.

669
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:39,860
But a monoculture is not a forest.

670
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:44,031
By definition,
there is little diversity.

671
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:48,076
One forest does not
replace another forest.

672
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:50,078
At the foot of these eucalyptus trees,

673
01:10:50,163 --> 01:10:53,790
nothing grows,
because their leaves form a bed...

674
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:56,793
that is toxic for most other plants.

675
01:10:56,878 --> 01:11:01,340
They grow quickly,
but exhaust water reserves.

676
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:21,526
Soybeans, palm oil, eucalyptus trees-

677
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:26,823
Deforestation destroys the essential
to produce the superfluous.

678
01:11:26,908 --> 01:11:31,370
But elsewhere, deforestation
is a last resort to survive.

679
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,627
Over two billion people-

680
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:41,630
almost a third
of the world's population—

681
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:43,632
still depend on charcoal.

682
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:59,022
In Haiti, one of the world's
poorest countries,

683
01:11:59,107 --> 01:12:03,485
charcoal is one of
the population's main consumables.

684
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:06,530
Once the pearl of the Caribbean,

685
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:10,158
Haiti can no longer feed
its population without foreign aid.

686
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:28,844
On the hills of Haiti, only two
percent of the forests are left.

687
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:32,931
Stripped bare, the soil no
longer absorbs the rainwater.

688
01:12:33,016 --> 01:12:36,518
With no vegetation
and no roots to reinforce them,

689
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:39,271
nothing holds the soils back.

690
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:43,608
The rainwater washes them
down the hillsides as far as the sea.

691
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:46,903
Erosion impoverishes
the quality of the soils,

692
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:49,990
reducing their suitability
for agriculture.

693
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:57,122
In some parts of Madagascar,
the erosion is spectacular.

694
01:12:57,206 --> 01:13:01,668
Whole hillsides bear deep gashes
hundreds of meters wide.

695
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:15,057
Thin and fragile,
soil is made by living matter.

696
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:17,893
With erosion, the fine layer of humus,

697
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:21,980
which took thousands of years
to form, disappears.

698
01:14:07,401 --> 01:14:10,570
Here's one theory
of the story of the Rapa Nui,

699
01:14:10,655 --> 01:14:12,739
the inhabitants of Easter Island,

700
01:14:12,824 --> 01:14:15,325
that could perhaps
give us pause for thought.

701
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:19,788
Living on the most isolated
island in the world,

702
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:22,415
the Rapa Nui exploited
their resources...

703
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,751
until there was nothing left.

704
01:14:24,836 --> 01:14:28,713
Their civilization did not survive.

705
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:32,592
On these lands stood
the highest palm trees in the world.

706
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:34,636
They have disappeared.

707
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:37,639
The Rapa Nui chopped them
all down for lumber.

708
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:40,559
They then had to face
widespread soil erosion.

709
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:44,271
The Rapa Nui could
no longer go fishing.

710
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:47,607
There were no trees to build canoes.

711
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:52,612
And yet the Rapa Nui formed one of the
most brilliant civilizations in the Pacific.

712
01:14:52,697 --> 01:14:56,783
Innovative farmers, sculptors,
exceptional navigators,

713
01:14:56,868 --> 01:15:01,288
they were caught in a vise of
overpopulation and dwindling resources.

714
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:08,837
They experienced social unrest,
revolts and famine.

715
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:11,631
Many did not survive the cataclysm.

716
01:16:00,681 --> 01:16:05,644
The real mystery of Easter Island
is not how its strange statues got there.

717
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:07,646
We know now.

718
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:11,107
It's why the Rapa Nui
didn't react in time.

719
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:20,617
It's only one of a number of theories,

720
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:23,328
but it has particular
relevance to us today.

721
01:16:24,956 --> 01:16:30,001
Since 1950, the world's
population has almost tripled.

722
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:35,423
And since 1950, we have more fundamentally
altered our island, the Earth,

723
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:39,678
than in all of our
200,000-year history.

724
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:47,602
Nigeria is the biggest
oil exporter in Africa,

725
01:16:47,687 --> 01:16:52,732
and yet 70% of the population
lives under the poverty line.

726
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:58,321
The wealth is there, but the country's
inhabitants don't have access to it.

727
01:16:58,406 --> 01:17:00,907
The same is true all over the globe.

728
01:17:00,992 --> 01:17:05,203
Half the world's poor
live in resource-rich countries.

729
01:17:21,554 --> 01:17:25,890
Our mode of development
has not fulfilled its promises.

730
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:29,644
In 50 years, the gap
between rich and poor...

731
01:17:29,729 --> 01:17:32,397
has grown wider than ever.

732
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:35,066
Today, half the world's wealth...

733
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:39,821
is in the hands of the richest
two percent of the population.

734
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:45,660
Can such disparities be maintained?

735
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,913
They're the cause
of population movements...

736
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:52,667
whose scale we have yet
to fully realize.

737
01:17:52,752 --> 01:17:58,423
The city of Lagos had a population
of 700,000 in 1960.

738
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:02,761
That will rise to 16 million by 2025.

739
01:18:07,767 --> 01:18:11,853
Lagos is one of the fastest-growing
megalopolises in the world.

740
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:15,523
The new arrivals are mostly
farmers forced off the land...

741
01:18:15,608 --> 01:18:18,193
for economic or demographic reasons,

742
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:21,071
or because of diminishing resources.

743
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:29,621
This is a radically new
type of urban growth,

744
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:34,125
driven by the urge to survive
rather than to prosper.

745
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:40,465
Every week, over a million people...

746
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:43,718
swell the populations
of the world's cities.

747
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:04,531
One human being in six
now lives in a precarious,

748
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:07,200
unhealthy, overpopulated environment,

749
01:19:07,284 --> 01:19:09,369
without access to daily necessities...

750
01:19:09,453 --> 01:19:12,622
such as water,
sanitation or electricity.

751
01:19:44,071 --> 01:19:46,239
Hunger is spreading once more.

752
01:19:46,323 --> 01:19:48,616
It affects nearly one billion people.

753
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:38,249
All over the planet, the poorest
scrabble to survive on scraps,

754
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:42,212
while we continue to dig for resources
that we can no longer live without.

755
01:20:43,714 --> 01:20:45,798
We look farther and farther afield,

756
01:20:45,883 --> 01:20:48,426
in previously unspoilt territory...

757
01:20:48,511 --> 01:20:52,722
and in regions that are
increasingly difficult to exploit.

758
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,733
We're not changing our model.

759
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:07,570
Oil might run out?

760
01:21:07,655 --> 01:21:12,283
We can still extract oil
from the tar sands of Canada.

761
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:16,579
The biggest trucks in the world
move thousands of tons of sand.

762
01:21:16,664 --> 01:21:19,123
The process of heating
and separating bitumen...

763
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:23,336
from the sand requires
millions of cubic meters of water.

764
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:27,757
Colossal amounts of energy are needed.

765
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:30,593
The pollution is catastrophic.

766
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:35,139
The most urgent priority, apparently,

767
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:38,309
is to pick every pocket of sunlight.

768
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:16,848
Our oil tankers are getting
bigger and bigger.

769
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:20,059
Our energy requirements
are constantly increasing.

770
01:22:20,144 --> 01:22:23,313
We try to power growth
like a bottomless oven...

771
01:22:23,397 --> 01:22:26,149
that demands more and more fuel.

772
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:44,959
It's all about carbon.

773
01:22:45,044 --> 01:22:48,963
In a few decades, the carbon
that made our atmosphere a furnace,

774
01:22:49,048 --> 01:22:52,175
and that nature captured
over millions of years,

775
01:22:52,259 --> 01:22:54,177
allowing life to develop,

776
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:56,888
will have largely been
pumped back out.

777
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,515
The atmosphere is heating up.

778
01:23:01,435 --> 01:23:05,897
It would have been inconceivable
for a boat to be here just a few years ago.

779
01:23:09,318 --> 01:23:14,072
Transport, industry,
deforestation, agriculture-

780
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:18,868
Our activities release gigantic
quantities of carbon dioxide.

781
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:22,497
Without realizing it,
molecule by molecule,

782
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:26,084
we have upset the Earth's
climatic balance.

783
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:33,132
All eyes are on the poles,

784
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:38,513
where the effects of
global warming are most visible.

785
01:23:38,597 --> 01:23:42,934
It's happening fast- very fast.

786
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:46,604
The Northwest Passage that connects
America, Europe and Asia...

787
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:49,190
via the pole is opening up.

788
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:52,110
The Arctic ice cap is melting.

789
01:23:57,366 --> 01:23:59,534
Under the effect of global warming,

790
01:23:59,618 --> 01:24:04,872
the ice cap has lost 40%
of its thickness in 40 years.

791
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:09,210
Its surface area in the summer
shrinks year by year.

792
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:12,547
It could disappear before 2030.

793
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:15,883
Some predictions suggest 2015.

794
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:20,471
Soon these waters will be free of ice
several summer months a year.

795
01:24:35,654 --> 01:24:39,240
The sunbeams that the ice sheet
previously reflected back...

796
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:42,410
now penetrate the dark water,
heating it up.

797
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:45,329
The warming process gathers pace.

798
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:58,342
This ice contains
the records of our planet.

799
01:24:58,427 --> 01:25:00,845
The concentration of carbon dioxide...

800
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:04,891
hasn't been so high
for several hundred thousand years.

801
01:25:06,185 --> 01:25:10,646
Humanity has never lived
in an atmosphere like this.

802
01:25:21,992 --> 01:25:27,705
Is excessive exploitation of our resources
threatening the lives of every species?

803
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:30,958
Climate change accentuates the threat.

804
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:34,754
By 2050, a quarter
of the Earth's species...

805
01:25:34,838 --> 01:25:38,424
could be threatened with extinction.

806
01:25:38,509 --> 01:25:43,679
In these polar regions, the balance
of nature has already been disrupted.

807
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:33,748
Off the coast of Greenland,
there are more and more icebergs.

808
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,860
Around the North Pole,
the ice cap has lost...

809
01:28:02,945 --> 01:28:06,781
30% of its surface area in 30 years.

810
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:12,370
But as Greenland
rapidly becomes warmer,

811
01:28:12,454 --> 01:28:14,622
the freshwater of a whole continent...

812
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:18,918
flows into the salt water
of the oceans.

813
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:24,215
Greenland's ice contains 20%
of the freshwater of the whole planet.

814
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:28,803
If it melts, sea levels will
rise by nearly seven meters.

815
01:29:02,087 --> 01:29:04,422
But there is no industry here.

816
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:08,509
Greenland's ice sheet
suffers from greenhouse gases...

817
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:11,429
emitted elsewhere on Earth.

818
01:29:11,513 --> 01:29:14,515
Our ecosystem doesn't have borders.

819
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:19,520
Wherever we are, our actions
have repercussions on the whole Earth.

820
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:23,524
The atmosphere of our planet
is an indivisible whole.

821
01:29:23,608 --> 01:29:26,444
It is an asset we share.

822
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:30,906
On Greenland's surface,
lakes are appearing on the landscape.

823
01:29:30,991 --> 01:29:33,200
The ice cap has begun
to melt at a speed...

824
01:29:33,285 --> 01:29:38,122
that even the most pessimistic
scientists did not envision 10 years ago.

825
01:29:47,591 --> 01:29:50,551
More and more
of these glacier-fed rivers...

826
01:29:50,635 --> 01:29:54,597
are merging together
and burrowing through the surface.

827
01:29:54,681 --> 01:29:58,726
It was thought the water would freeze
in the depths of the ice.

828
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:01,854
On the contrary,
it flows under the ice,

829
01:30:01,938 --> 01:30:03,898
carrying the ice sheet into the sea,

830
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:05,941
where it breaks into icebergs.

831
01:30:48,693 --> 01:30:50,945
As the freshwater
of Greenland's ice sheet...

832
01:30:51,029 --> 01:30:54,115
gradually seeps into
the salt water of the oceans,

833
01:30:54,199 --> 01:30:57,868
low-lying lands
around the globe are threatened.

834
01:31:07,129 --> 01:31:09,505
Sea levels are rising.

835
01:31:09,589 --> 01:31:12,591
Water expanding
as it gets warmer caused,

836
01:31:12,676 --> 01:31:17,138
in the 20th century alone,
a rise of 20 centimeters.

837
01:31:17,222 --> 01:31:20,432
Everything becomes unstable.

838
01:31:20,517 --> 01:31:24,103
Coral reefs, for example,
are extremely sensitive...

839
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:26,605
to the slightest change
in water temperature.

840
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:29,108
Thirty percent have disappeared.

841
01:31:29,192 --> 01:31:32,361
They are an essential link
in the chain of species.

842
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:52,464
In the atmosphere, the major wind
streams are changing direction.

843
01:31:52,549 --> 01:31:54,842
Rain cycles are altered.

844
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:58,554
The geography of climates is modified.

845
01:31:58,638 --> 01:32:01,682
The inhabitants of low-lying
islands here in the Maldives,

846
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:03,684
for example, are on the front line.

847
01:32:03,768 --> 01:32:06,228
They are increasingly concerned.

848
01:32:06,313 --> 01:32:09,231
Some are already looking
for new, more hospitable lands.

849
01:32:16,281 --> 01:32:20,201
If sea levels continue
to rise faster and faster,

850
01:32:20,285 --> 01:32:22,411
what will major cities like Tokyo,

851
01:32:22,495 --> 01:32:25,581
the world's most populous city, do?

852
01:32:25,665 --> 01:32:29,710
Every year, scientists' predictions
become more and more alarming.

853
01:32:29,794 --> 01:32:34,924
Seventy percent of the world's
population lives on coastal plains.

854
01:32:35,008 --> 01:32:41,180
Eleven of the 15 biggest cities
stand on a coastline or river estuary.

855
01:32:41,264 --> 01:32:44,391
As the seas rise,
salt will invade the water table,

856
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:47,645
depriving inhabitants
of drinking water.

857
01:33:02,327 --> 01:33:04,912
Migratory phenomena are inevitable.

858
01:33:04,996 --> 01:33:08,332
The only uncertainty
concerns their scale.

859
01:33:34,401 --> 01:33:36,318
dd

860
01:33:36,403 --> 01:33:41,156
In Africa, Mount Kilimanjaro
is unrecognizable.

861
01:33:41,241 --> 01:33:44,159
Eighty percent of its
glaciers have disappeared.

862
01:33:44,244 --> 01:33:46,954
In summer, the rivers no longer flow.

863
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:50,040
Local peoples are affected
by the lack of water.

864
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:55,587
Even on the world's highest peaks,
in the heart of the Himalayas,

865
01:33:55,672 --> 01:33:58,299
eternal snows and glaciers
are receding.

866
01:33:58,383 --> 01:34:00,926
dd

867
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:06,348
Yet these glaciers play
an essential role in the water cycle.

868
01:34:06,433 --> 01:34:09,351
They trap the water
from the monsoons as ice...

869
01:34:09,436 --> 01:34:12,604
and release it in the summer
when the snow melts.

870
01:34:23,992 --> 01:34:28,412
The glaciers of the Himalayas are the
source of all the great Asian rivers-

871
01:34:28,496 --> 01:34:32,750
the Indus, Ganges,
Mekong, Yangtze Kiang.

872
01:34:32,834 --> 01:34:36,754
Two billion people
depend on them for drinking water...

873
01:34:36,838 --> 01:34:40,466
and to irrigate their crops,
as in Bangladesh.

874
01:34:45,555 --> 01:34:48,849
On the delta of the Ganges
and Brahmaputra,

875
01:34:48,933 --> 01:34:52,061
Bangladesh is directly
affected by the phenomena...

876
01:34:52,145 --> 01:34:55,272
occurring in the Himalayas
and at sea level.

877
01:34:55,357 --> 01:34:59,276
This is one of the most populous
and poorest countries in the world.

878
01:34:59,361 --> 01:35:01,570
It is already hit by global warming.

879
01:35:01,654 --> 01:35:06,492
The combined impact of increasingly
dramatic floods and hurricanes...

880
01:35:06,576 --> 01:35:09,411
could make a third
of its landmass disappear.

881
01:35:09,496 --> 01:35:13,082
When populations are subjected
to these devastating phenomena,

882
01:35:13,166 --> 01:35:15,459
they eventually move away.

883
01:35:22,133 --> 01:35:24,468
Wealthy countries will not be spared.

884
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:27,554
Droughts are occurring
all over the planet.

885
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:31,975
In Australia,
half of farmland is already affected.

886
01:36:17,063 --> 01:36:21,233
We are in the process
of compromising the climatic balance...

887
01:36:21,317 --> 01:36:25,654
that has allowed us
to develop over 12,000 years.

888
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:39,751
More and more wildfires
encroach on major cities.

889
01:36:39,836 --> 01:36:43,255
In turn, they exacerbate
global warming.

890
01:36:43,339 --> 01:36:47,551
As the trees burn,
they release carbon dioxide.

891
01:36:47,635 --> 01:36:52,473
The system that controls our climate
has been severely disrupted.

892
01:36:52,557 --> 01:36:56,727
The elements on which it relies
have been disrupted.

893
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:57,329
The clock of climate change is ticking
in these magnificent landscapes.

894
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:02,459
Here in Siberia
and elsewhere across the globe,

895
01:38:02,544 --> 01:38:06,755
it is so cold that the ground
is constantly frozen.

896
01:38:06,839 --> 01:38:09,174
It's known as permafrost.

897
01:38:23,273 --> 01:38:27,901
Under its surface lies
a climatic time bomb: methane,

898
01:38:27,986 --> 01:38:33,240
a greenhouse gas 20 times
more powerful than carbon dioxide.

899
01:38:33,324 --> 01:38:36,034
If the permafrost melts,
the methane released...

900
01:38:36,119 --> 01:38:39,830
would cause the greenhouse effect
to race out of control,

901
01:38:39,914 --> 01:38:42,749
with consequences no one can predict.

902
01:38:42,834 --> 01:38:46,670
We would literally be
in unknown territory.

903
01:39:09,068 --> 01:39:13,113
Humanity has no more than 10 years
to reverse the trend...

904
01:39:13,197 --> 01:39:16,199
and avoid crossing
into this territory—

905
01:39:16,284 --> 01:39:18,619
life on Earth
as we have never known it.

906
01:39:51,235 --> 01:39:54,988
We have created phenomena
we cannot control.

907
01:39:55,073 --> 01:40:01,411
Since our origins, water, air
and forms of life are intimately linked.

908
01:40:01,496 --> 01:40:05,832
But recently,
we have broken those links.

909
01:40:05,917 --> 01:40:08,418
Let's face the facts.

910
01:40:08,503 --> 01:40:11,588
We must believe what we know.

911
01:40:11,673 --> 01:40:16,843
All that we have just seen
is a reflection of human behavior.

912
01:40:16,928 --> 01:40:20,764
We have shaped the Earth in our image.

913
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:24,184
We have very little time to change.

914
01:40:24,268 --> 01:40:28,772
How can this century carry the burden
of nine billion human beings...

915
01:40:28,856 --> 01:40:31,775
if we refuse to be called
to account...

916
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:34,695
for everything we alone have done?

917
01:40:44,372 --> 01:40:47,374
dd

918
01:44:12,663 --> 01:44:14,664
dd

919
01:44:31,349 --> 01:44:33,600
The cost of our actions is high.

920
01:44:33,684 --> 01:44:37,437
Others pay the price without
having been actively involved.

921
01:44:37,521 --> 01:44:40,732
I have seen refugee camps
as big as cities,

922
01:44:40,816 --> 01:44:42,943
sprawling in the desert.

923
01:44:43,027 --> 01:44:45,737
How many men, women and children...

924
01:44:45,821 --> 01:44:47,781
will be left by the wayside tomorrow?

925
01:44:51,702 --> 01:44:53,620
Must we always build walls...

926
01:44:53,704 --> 01:44:55,789
to break the chain
of human solidarity,

927
01:44:55,873 --> 01:45:01,795
separate peoples and protect the happiness
of some from the misery of others?

928
01:45:01,879 --> 01:45:04,506
It's too late to be a pessimist.

929
01:45:04,590 --> 01:45:08,218
I know that a single human
can knock down every wall.

930
01:45:08,302 --> 01:45:10,887
It's too late to be a pessimist.

931
01:45:10,972 --> 01:45:15,225
Worldwide, four children
out of five attend school.

932
01:45:15,309 --> 01:45:18,478
Never has learning been given
to so many human beings.

933
01:45:18,562 --> 01:45:23,066
Everyone, from richest to poorest,
can make a contribution.

934
01:45:23,150 --> 01:45:25,902
Lesotho, one of the world's
poorest countries,

935
01:45:25,987 --> 01:45:30,740
is proportionally the one that invests
most in its people's education.

936
01:45:30,825 --> 01:45:33,410
Qatar, one of the world's
richest states,

937
01:45:33,494 --> 01:45:36,413
has opened its doors
to the best universities.

938
01:45:36,497 --> 01:45:42,252
Culture, education, research and
innovation are inexhaustible resources.

939
01:45:42,336 --> 01:45:45,046
In the face of misery and suffering,

940
01:45:45,131 --> 01:45:48,758
millions of N.G.O.'s prove
that solidarity between peoples...

941
01:45:48,843 --> 01:45:52,137
is stronger than
the selfishness of nations.

942
01:45:52,221 --> 01:45:55,306
In Bangladesh, a man
thought the unthinkable...

943
01:45:55,391 --> 01:45:58,435
and founded a bank
that lends only to the poor.

944
01:45:58,519 --> 01:46:01,271
In barely 30 years,
it has changed the lives...

945
01:46:01,355 --> 01:46:04,983
of 150 million people
around the world.

946
01:46:06,944 --> 01:46:10,530
Antarctica is a continent
with immense natural resources...

947
01:46:10,614 --> 01:46:12,949
that no country can claim for itself,

948
01:46:13,034 --> 01:46:16,703
a natural reserve devoted
to peace and science.

949
01:46:16,787 --> 01:46:21,750
A treaty signed by 49 states has made
it a treasure shared by all humanity.

950
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:24,878
It's too late to be a pessimist.

951
01:46:24,962 --> 01:46:29,799
Governments have acted to protect nearly two
percent of the world's territorial waters.

952
01:46:29,884 --> 01:46:32,844
It's not much, but it's two
times more than 10 years ago.

953
01:46:32,928 --> 01:46:37,348
The first natural parks were created
just over a century ago.

954
01:46:37,433 --> 01:46:40,560
They cover over 13% of the continents.

955
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:43,313
They create spaces where
human activity is in step...

956
01:46:43,397 --> 01:46:47,567
with the preservation
of species, soils and landscapes.

957
01:46:47,651 --> 01:46:52,072
This harmony between humans
and nature can become the rule,

958
01:46:52,156 --> 01:46:54,074
no longer the exception.

959
01:46:54,158 --> 01:46:58,244
In the United States, New York has
realized that nature does for us.

960
01:46:58,329 --> 01:47:02,332
These forests and lakes supply
all the drinking water the city needs.

961
01:47:07,171 --> 01:47:11,216
In South Korea, the forests
have been devastated by war.

962
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:14,219
Thanks to a national
reforestation program,

963
01:47:14,303 --> 01:47:17,388
they once more
cover 65% of the country.

964
01:47:17,473 --> 01:47:21,601
More than 75% of paper is recycled.

965
01:47:21,685 --> 01:47:26,981
Costa Rica has made a choice between military
spending and the conservation of its lands.

966
01:47:27,066 --> 01:47:28,983
The country no longer has an army.

967
01:47:29,068 --> 01:47:32,403
It prefers to devote its resources
to education, ecotourism...

968
01:47:32,488 --> 01:47:35,406
and the protection
of its primary forest.

969
01:47:35,491 --> 01:47:38,576
Gabon is one of the world's
leading producers of wood.

970
01:47:38,661 --> 01:47:40,912
It enforces selective logging—

971
01:47:40,996 --> 01:47:43,581
not more than one tree every hectare.

972
01:47:43,666 --> 01:47:47,252
Its forests are one of the country's
most important economic resources,

973
01:47:47,336 --> 01:47:50,130
but they have the time to regenerate.

974
01:47:50,214 --> 01:47:54,592
Programs exist that guarantee
sustainable forest management.

975
01:47:54,677 --> 01:47:57,011
They must become mandatory.

976
01:48:01,016 --> 01:48:03,101
For consumers and producers,

977
01:48:03,185 --> 01:48:05,854
justice is an opportunity
to be seized.

978
01:48:05,938 --> 01:48:09,607
When trade is fair,
when both buyer and seller benefit,

979
01:48:09,692 --> 01:48:12,569
everybody can prosper
and earn a decent living.

980
01:48:20,035 --> 01:48:22,078
How can there be justice and equity...

981
01:48:22,163 --> 01:48:25,165
between people whose only tools
are their hands...

982
01:48:25,249 --> 01:48:29,919
and those who harvest their crops
with a machine and state subsidies?

983
01:48:36,427 --> 01:48:38,887
Let's be responsible consumers.

984
01:48:38,971 --> 01:48:41,139
Think about what we buy.

985
01:48:42,975 --> 01:48:45,727
It's too late to be a pessimist.

986
01:48:45,811 --> 01:48:48,146
I have seen agriculture
on a human scale.

987
01:48:48,230 --> 01:48:53,276
It can feed the whole planet if meat production
doesn't take the food out of people's mouths.

988
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:57,363
I have seen fishermen
who take care what they catch...

989
01:48:57,448 --> 01:48:59,908
and care for the riches of the ocean.

990
01:49:01,118 --> 01:49:04,037
I have seen houses
producing their own energy.

991
01:49:04,121 --> 01:49:08,208
5,000 people live in the world's
first ever eco-friendly district,

992
01:49:08,292 --> 01:49:10,210
in Freiburg, Germany.

993
01:49:10,294 --> 01:49:12,253
Other cities partner the project.

994
01:49:12,338 --> 01:49:15,506
Mumbai is the thousandth to join them.

995
01:49:18,469 --> 01:49:22,388
The governments of New Zealand,
Iceland, Austria, Sweden...

996
01:49:22,473 --> 01:49:24,724
and other nations
have made the development...

997
01:49:24,808 --> 01:49:28,102
of renewable energy sources
a top priority.

998
01:49:28,187 --> 01:49:31,898
I know that 80% of the energy
we consume...

999
01:49:31,982 --> 01:49:34,234
comes from fossil energy sources.

1000
01:49:34,318 --> 01:49:39,572
Every week, two new coal-fired generating
plants are built in China alone.

1001
01:49:39,657 --> 01:49:42,242
But I have also seen, in Denmark,

1002
01:49:42,326 --> 01:49:44,911
a prototype of a coal-fired plant...

1003
01:49:44,995 --> 01:49:48,748
that releases its carbon
into the soil rather than the air.

1004
01:49:48,832 --> 01:49:51,459
A solution for the future?
Nobody knows yet.

1005
01:49:52,670 --> 01:49:54,587
I have seen, in Iceland,

1006
01:49:54,672 --> 01:49:59,467
an electricity plant powered
by the Earth's heat— geothermal power.

1007
01:49:59,551 --> 01:50:02,595
I have seen a sea snake
lying on the swell...

1008
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:06,849
to absorb the energy of the waves
and produce electricity.

1009
01:50:11,021 --> 01:50:13,982
I have seen wind farms
off the coast of Denmark...

1010
01:50:14,066 --> 01:50:17,777
that produce 20%
of the country's electricity.

1011
01:50:17,861 --> 01:50:21,823
The U.S.A., China, India,
Germany and Spain...

1012
01:50:21,907 --> 01:50:25,118
are the biggest investors
in renewable energy.

1013
01:50:25,202 --> 01:50:29,038
They have already created over
two and a half million jobs.

1014
01:50:29,123 --> 01:50:32,542
Where on Earth doesn't the wind blow?

1015
01:50:34,086 --> 01:50:39,465
I have seen desert expanses
baking in the sun.

1016
01:50:39,550 --> 01:50:41,634
Everything on Earth is linked,

1017
01:50:41,719 --> 01:50:46,139
and the Earth is linked to the sun,
its original energy source.

1018
01:50:46,223 --> 01:50:50,018
Can humans not imitate plants
and capture its energy?

1019
01:50:50,102 --> 01:50:53,187
In one hour,
the sun gives the Earth...

1020
01:50:53,272 --> 01:50:58,818
the same amount of energy as that
consumed by all humanity in one year.

1021
01:50:58,902 --> 01:51:03,740
As long as the Earth exists,
the sun's energy will be inexhaustible.

1022
01:51:03,824 --> 01:51:08,328
All we have to do is stop drilling
the Earth and start looking to the sky.

1023
01:51:08,412 --> 01:51:11,748
All we have to do
is learn to cultivate the sun.

1024
01:51:11,832 --> 01:51:17,378
All these experiments are only examples,
but they testify to a new awareness.

1025
01:51:17,463 --> 01:51:20,923
They lay down markers
for a new human adventure...

1026
01:51:21,008 --> 01:51:25,261
based on moderation,
intelligence and sharing.

1027
01:51:32,353 --> 01:51:34,687
dd

1028
01:51:41,028 --> 01:51:43,780
It's time to come together.

1029
01:51:43,864 --> 01:51:49,285
What's important is not what's gone,
but what remains.

1030
01:51:49,370 --> 01:51:52,288
We still have
half the world's forests,

1031
01:51:52,373 --> 01:51:54,957
thousands of rivers,
lakes and glaciers...

1032
01:51:55,042 --> 01:51:57,126
and thousands of thriving species.

1033
01:51:57,211 --> 01:52:00,380
dd

1034
01:52:01,757 --> 01:52:05,551
We know that the solutions
are there today.

1035
01:52:05,636 --> 01:52:08,137
We all have the power to change.

1036
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:12,809
So what are we waiting for?

1037
01:52:14,436 --> 01:52:17,647
dd

1038
01:52:50,013 --> 01:52:52,515
dd

1039
01:56:45,791 --> 01:56:49,919
dd

1040
01:56:55,175 --> 01:56:58,427
dd

1041
01:57:54,151 --> 01:57:56,485
dd
