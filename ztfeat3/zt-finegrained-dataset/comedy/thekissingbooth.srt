Look at that cute baby!
That's me, Elle Evans.

3
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:29,446
And the smelly, less-cute baby right
next to me? That's my best friend Lee.

4
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:33,158
Lee and I were born on the same day,
at the same time,

5
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,868
here in Los Angeles, California.

6
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:38,747
Our moms were BFFs before people
even used the term "BFF,"

7
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,290
so we were raised like twins

8
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:43,126
and we've been pretty much
inseparable ever since.

00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,051
but for as long as I can remember,

12
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,678
Lee and I have absolutely

13
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,472

00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:08,526
Anyway a lot of stuff has happened
between now and then.

18
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,210
Let me get you up to speed.
First Christmas I remember, I was six.

19
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,490
I got a Barbie dance party.
Lee got a scooter.

20
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,933
Broke my leg riding Lee's scooter.

21
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:18,578
Had my cast signed by Lee, who bought me
ice cream to make up for breaking my leg.

22
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,414
Dressed as a cowboy for Halloween,
Lee went as a doctor.

23
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,666
Learned how to ride a bike,
learned how to swim.

24
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,628
Got protected by Lee's older brother Noah,

25
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,963
who chased off some bullies
who were hassling us.

26
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,632
Had to pay protection tax, though.

27
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:33,426

Watched Lee catch his first fish.

33
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,940
Watched Noah in his first fight. He won.

34
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,733
Dressed as a fireman for Halloween.

35
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,443
Lee went as some weird bird.

36
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,279
Found out that my mom was sick.

37
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,991
Went to visit her in the hospital
for the first time.

38
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,994
Tried to get used to seeing her there.

39
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,556
Got in a fight with Lee
over who's the best dancer.

40
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,124
Made up by getting him ice cream.

41
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,251
Got in a fight with Noah
for beating up Lee.

42
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,128
Made up with Noah
by letting him fix my bike.

43
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,629
He is so handy!

44
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,090
Got my first bra. Didn't really need it.

45
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,424
Discovered I like soccer.

46
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,427
Discovered a way to get
to our favorite place to dance.

52
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,025
Discovered that I wasn't gonna be
a fashion icon.

53
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,361
Discovered I am good at sports.

54
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,405
Had a tough talk with Dad.

55
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,365
Sat with mom in the hospital.

56
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,868
I tried to help her put makeup on.

57
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,744
Not much help.

58
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,203
Hey...

59
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,857
Held her hand a long time.

60
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,252
Only cried when she was asleep.

61
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,338
Tried to score my first kiss
with Randy Melrose.

62
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,424
Wasn't exactly a love connection.

63
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,885
Watched Noah getting really, really cute!

64
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,304
Watched Noah in yet another fight.
He won.

65
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,347
Got my period! Finally!

66
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,057
Went as a pirate for Halloween.

67
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,225
Lee was the Black Swan.

68
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,561
Said goodbye to my mom.

69
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,105
Had a lot to say.

70
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,191
Told her all about Noah.

71
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,110
Watched Noah ride his motorcycle
for the first time.

72
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,487
Watched Lee try to ride Noah's motorcycle.

73
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,282
Watched Noah teach Lee a lesson
for sitting on his motorcycle.

74
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,243
Celebrated with Lee
when he got his dream car.

75
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,621
Learned that girls can be really mean.

76
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,831
Played Seven Minutes in Heaven. Fail!

77
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,125
Got a bra I suddenly did need!

78
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,003
Wondered why I still hadn't been
kissed yet or even been on a date.

79
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,504
No big deal, I guess.

80
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,673
Realized I had a crush on Noah.

81
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,300
Got over my crush on Noah...

82
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,177

savoring the last fleeting moments
of summer at Lee's totally awesome house.

89
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:01,449
It's moments like this that make me wish
things could stay this way forever.

Ew! Perv!

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,945
the student council
is expecting our dance club idea

this week for the fall fundraiser.

Noah Flynn is stupid hot,

106
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,341
but Lee and I developed
a list of friendship rules.

107
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,802
Lee was responsible for Rule Number Nine,

108
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,847
which specifically states,
"relatives of your best friend

109
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,057
are totally off-limits."

110
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,101
This is a really big one for Lee.

111
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:13,855
I guess it comes from living
in the shadow of a high school legend.

112

Lee, you seen my athletic cup?

Yes, asshat.

114

00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,262
- What about your back-up back-ups?
- These are my back-up back-ups!

165
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,752
- Okay, okay!
- Come on, let's go!

166
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,596
Okay, I'm trying.
Seriously though, cover up.

167
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,549
- Like, I'm trying to drive.
- Stop! You're so stupid!

168
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,471
♪ There's nowhere left to go ♪

169
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:58,436
♪ It struck me
That the two of us could run ♪

170
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,902
Nice landing, ace!

171
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,545
Well, if you got your driver's license,

172
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,530
you wouldn't have to put up
with my driving.

173
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:13,034
Okay, but why would I do that
when I have you as my personal chauffeur?

174
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,035
True.

175
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,912
Oh! And today,

176
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,455
fundraiser ideas.

177
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,082
- Fine.
- Thank you!

178
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,670
Hey, man, is that girl new?

179
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,132
Jeez, guys! Check out that.

180
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,594
Oh, my word!

181
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,806
Yo! I think that's Elle Evans!

182
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,767
Everybody's looking at us.

183
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,521
Allow me to revise.
Everyone is looking at you.

184
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,357
- Damn!
- What? No, they're not!

185
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,653
Elle, you are aware that your lady shape
sort of changed over the summer, right?

186
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:49,820
It was true.

187
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,406
This was the moment
that happens to all of us

188
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,327
when you suddenly go from invisible
to everyone staring at you.

189
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,997
- What the hell, Tuppen?
- It's fine, Lee. I got this.

190
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,749
Relax, tiny Flynn.

191
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,376
How about I relax your face?

192
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,211
Lee, it's fine! I got this! Lee!

193
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,631
I did not think that through.

194
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,758
No, no, no!

195
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,717
Noah!

196
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,930
Noah, stop!

197
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,724
Enough, Noah! Stop! Are you crazy?

198
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,434
Knock it off!

199
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,854
Knock it off!

200
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,982
Now you three, in my office!

201
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,692
- Me?
- Now!

202
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:35,074
Everyone, homeroom! Now!

203
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,950
Douchebag!

204
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,869
He even gets credit for my fights!

205
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,083
Why did you do that?

206
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,710
Lee was in trouble.

207
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,046
Any excuse for a fight, right?

208
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,965
I don't start fights, okay?

209
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,592
I only finish them.

210
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,304
And besides,
no one should treat a girl like that.

211
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,972
Especially if that girl is you.

212
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,558
Me?

213
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:04,061
Yeah. It's like those guys are trying
to get in my little sister's pants,

214
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,731
which is super gross.

215
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:11,861
Never great to hear your childhood
crush say it's super gross in your pants.

216
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,988
You know, you have zero experience
with guys.

217
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,890
You've never even had a boyfriend.

218
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:17,700
Whatever!

219
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,453
Wearing a skirt like that
is asking for it.

220
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,538
Seriously?

221
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,040
You want to go down that road?

222
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,752
No.

223
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:33,007
I kind of just played the whole
sexist conversation out in my head

224
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,301
and it always ended
with me sounding like a dick.

225
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:48,856
Miss Evans.

226
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,399
First off,

227
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,110
that skirt is ridiculous.

228
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,030
- My pants ripped! It's all I had.
- What about your back-ups?

229
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,673
- Dry cleaners.
- Your back-up back-ups?

230
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,326
- These are my back-up back-ups!
- All right! Don't get so upset!

231
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:03,329
I am upset. Dude touched
my lady-bump.

232
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,166
And Mr. Tuppen will be punished,

233
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,628
but I also, unfortunately,
must punish you.

234
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,006
- Oh, my God! Am I being expelled?
- Elle...

235
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,218
I've never been in trouble before. I feel
like it's hot in here. I'm sweating.

236
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,761
- Elle!
- What?

237
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,304
You only broke the dress code.

238
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,472
That's all.

239
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,433
Detention tomorrow.

240
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:39,073
♪ Say yeah, say yea h ♪

241
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,200
♪ Say yeah ♪

242
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,327
♪ Say yeah... ♪

243
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,624
Oh, my God!

244
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,292
How crazy was that fight?

245
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,877
Flynn was so savage!

246
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,004
Have you made out with him yet?

247
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,717
These three super-popular juniors
are kind of package deal.

248
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,010
I call them the OMG Girls.

249
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:03,180
Olivia, Mia, and Gwyneth.

250
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,433
And I have no idea
why they're sitting with me.

251
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,851
Oh, my God.

252
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,603
I would totally have babies with Noah.

253
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,480
One girl, one boy.

254
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,566
But not at the same time though.

255
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,984
Mm-mmm.

256
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,195
Yeah, you don't really get to pick
the gender so much.

257
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,157
I hear he's into blondes. Too bad, Elle.

258
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,577
Give me your numerals.
We should def catch up.

259
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,996
Okay, yeah! It's 310...

260
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,079
Oh, my God.

261
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,249
Oooh.

262
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,375
Got to go, Elle.

263
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,502
There's a shemergency
in the locker room.

264
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,254
Oh, okay.

265
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,757
Sorry it didn't work out
with you and Noah.

266
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,960
Guess it wasn't meant to be.

267
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,389
What just happened? And why were
the OMG Girls being so nice to me?

268
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,684
But more importantly,
when did they eat those?

269
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,314
- Was that Mia?
- Did you see that?

270
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,542
She say anything about me?
You tell her about my dimples?

271
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,776
What did she smell like today?

272
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:00,780
Sometimes she smells like apples
or kind of like blueberry-coconut fusion.

273
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:03,907
What?

274
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,236
What are you doing anyway?

275
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,461
I am trying to find a good idea
for our carnival fundraiser.

276
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,797
Somebody has to.

277
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,299
Come on.

278
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,427
What about the strength game, the one
with the sledgehammer and the bell?

279
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,764
Yeah, the chess team picked that one.
I know.

280
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,951
What about... Ooh!
What about a dunking booth?

281
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,852
- Swimming team picked it.
- Damn it!

282
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,814
I know, dude! Who saw that one coming?

283
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,943
Okay, do you think Mia
would like this one?

284
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:42,488
Because I think it makes my eyes pop,
and I really want to kiss her on Friday.

285
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:46,033
Come on! Today was the first time
the OMGs ever spoke to me.

286
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,702
Do you really think Mia knows who you are?

287
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,832
Baby steps, Elle. Baby steps.

288
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,835
Lee, come on. She's a varsity cheerleader.

289
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,672
Basically, the only way she'd ever
make out with you is if you paid for it.

290
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,760
- Kissing booth!
- Kissing booth!

291
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,346
Oh, that is the perfect
carnival fundraiser!

292
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,890
Yes! Oh, also,

293
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:13,727
I love the irony. The girl who's never
been kissed does a kissing booth? What?

294
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,480
Yes, irony is a cruel mistress indeed.

295
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,457
Okay, well, now all we need
is the student council to approve it.

296
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,110
Yes. Don't worry. Leave that to me.

297
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,070
Okay. Wait.

298
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,365
What about this one?

299
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,284
Mia will love it.

300
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,079
- Really?
- No, dude! It's awful!

301
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,538
Dammit!

302
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:39,669
Psst.

303
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,108
Psst.

304
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,506
Psst.

305
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,963

00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,566
Well, it was a really nice apology.

313
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,611
Plus, that whole skirt thing
was priceless!

314
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,739
If word gets out that fighting me
is a way of getting your number,

315
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,033
I am in for a super long junior year.

316
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,577
Oh, I wouldn't really call it a fight.

Mmm.

- Unless you think I shouldn't.
- No, actually, I think you should.

320
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,171
You're gonna have to go on a date
eventually.

321
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,214
- Right?
- You know?

322
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,297
So?

323
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,154
God, what do people even do on dates?

324
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,220
I don't know.
Sit around and eat food, I guess.

325
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,476
♪ Hey, you ♪

326
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,563
♪ You wanna learn the Yippie? ♪

327
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,649
♪ Let me show you how it's done... ♪

328
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,776
All right!

329
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,860
Okay.

330
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,114
My heart is beating so fast.

331
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,658
That is just fine.

332
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,994
Okay, listen. Can you just
keep your phone on you?

333
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:20,122
Because I know myself and I'm gonna
run out of things to talk about

334
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,249
- and I really want to call you...
- No.

335
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,126
- I know myself.
- No! Do not call me.

336
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,296
Okay? If he can't see
how completely baller you are,

337
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,090
Then he's not the right guy for you.

338
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,178
Oh! You can be so sweet
when you want to be.

339
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,471
Oh, I know!

340
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:39,932
Kill it.

341
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,728
- Okay, thank you for driving me.
- Totally.

342
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,438
- Love you. Bye!
- Love you.

343
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,399
Have a good time!
But not too good of a time!

344
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,168
God! What is wrong with me?

345
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,002
Is my butt too big?

346
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,380
Am I some sort of freak or something?

347
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,466
No! You're awesome, all right?

348
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:16,011
Tuppen is just a dick. I don't know why
I told you to go out with him.

349
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,639
Maybe because he's the only guy
that's ever asked me out.

350
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,642
Stop it, all right? Tuppen isn't worth it.

351
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,227
You're way too good for him.

352
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,314
Plus I heard he's got like, three nipples.

353
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,400
Just saying.

354
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,903
Thanks for doing this for me.

355
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,280
Are you kidding me? I live for this shit.

356
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,996
Alrighty. Hit the road.

357
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,874
You had your shot.
Keep on moving, bud.

358
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,751
I need to talk to Elle.

359
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,669
Lee, it's okay.

360
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,008
So,

361
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,387
running a bit late now, are we?

362
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,140
Look. I'm sorry I stood you up.

363
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,433
I really did want to go out with you.

364
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,978
I just thought you deserve
a little bit of an explanation.

365
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,230
That would be nice.

366
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,441
Flynn...

367
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,778
told me that it wouldn't be smart
if I showed up for our date tonight.

368
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:16,738
Noah?

369
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,823
Yeah.

370
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,950
That literally makes no sense.

371
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,035
It's true, and it's not just me.

372
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,997
He's been going around
telling all the guys not to ask you out

373
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,080
for a while now.

374
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,790
What?

375
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,168
Shit.

376
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,251
There's others?

377
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,879
You can't tell him I told you.

378
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,130
Why do you care?

379
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:36,091
No boobs are worth a broken nose.

380
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,385
Fine!

381
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,595
I got to go.

382
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,388
Go! Whatever!

383
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,471
Leave!

384
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:46,018
But just so you know,
my boobs are fantastic!

385
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,687
Yes, some would even say breathtaking!

386
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:56,904
Shit.

387
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:59,364
You do realize
that you're not my dad, right?

388
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,283
Look, you still got a lot to learn, kiddo.

389
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,745
Kiddo? Oh, my God.

390
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,539
Oh, if you were here,
I would beat you with my shoe,

391
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,749
Tuppen is a player.

392
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:09,875
So are you!

393
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,044
And that's why I know he's wrong for you.

394
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,755
- You're gonna thank me one day.
- Okay.

395
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,590
Well, today is not that day.

396
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:20,844
It is not your job to monitor
my dating life. Do you understand me?

397
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,931
The days of you controlling my life
are over!

398
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,808
We'll see about that.

399
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,736
Next proposal is from the dance club.

400
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,197
Elle Evans and Lee Flynn.

401
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,532
You have an accent.

402
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,371
Sorry.
I thought that was gonna be funnier.

403
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,207
And what is your idea for the fundraiser?

404
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,459
Um...

405
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,584
Sorry.

406
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:54,878
Okay.

407
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:59,007
We have an idea that we think
everyone will be very excited about.

408
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,511
But first, we want to thank you
for your time

409
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,096
and ask that you withold any...

410
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,347
Kissing booth!

411
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,228
Yeah, we want to do a kissing booth.

412
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,229
Hmm.

413
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,694
Okay, I think I speak for everyone

414
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,363
when I say kissing is the number one cause

415
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,657
of all germs, cavities,

416
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,284
shingles, gingivitis,

417
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,035
- cold sores...
- Ew.

418
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,829
Uh, it would be totally voluntary.

419
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:32,124
And no tongue,
because we're not the French.

420
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,251
Most of us.

421
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,004
I'm British, you wanker!

422
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,463
Excuse me,

423
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,758
- but would you be working the booth?
- Me?

424
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,428
No.

425
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,929
We're just the organizers.

426
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:50,684
But I can assure you,
we have some real A-listers lined up.

427
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,269
You can count on that.

428
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,688
Would Flynn be working the kissing booth?

429
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,690
Ha! Noah?

430
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,544
You'd have a better chance getting
Miley Cyrus to become a nun...

431
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,778
Absolutely! No, Flynn
will be working the booth.

432
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:05,699
I promise. Flynn will be there.

433
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:10,911
Hmph.

434
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,542
You're about to witness
a family tradition.

435
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,210
For as long as I can remember,

436
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,339
we've had lunch with the Flynns
every Sunday.

437
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,716
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

438
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,176
That's Mrs. Flynn.

439
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,844
She's sort of a surrogate mom to me.

440
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,138
I couldn't have made it through the years
without her.

441
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,097
How's school going?

442
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,601
Let's just say, "interesting."

443
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:36,980
I don't know what that means, but I want
to hear all the gory details later.

444
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,440
Hey.

445
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,526
Hi.

446
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,610
Hi there.

447
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,782
- And how's my favorite little man?
- I'm okay.

448
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,786
Hey, Noah! I haven't seen you
since you got back from football camp.

449
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,496
They got you starting again?

450
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:55,832
Well... he'll be lucky if he makes it
through the season.

451
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,753
He goes and gets into a fight
on the first day of school.

452
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,880
Really? What happened?

453
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,506
Tell him.

454
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,886
Here it comes.

455
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:13,016
It was just an argument over something
that happened at football camp.

456
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:15,977
Excuse me.

457
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,024
Wonder why he didn't say anything.

458
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,653
Our booth is going to kick ass
at the carnival.

459
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,072
Oh, and news update:

460
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:30,075
Mia stopped me in the hall and said
that she's going to the party tonight.

461
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,828
She wanted to make sure
that I would be there.

462
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,248
Well, sir, I wish you
the best of luck with that.

463
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,042
Oh, I have to go to practice right now.

464
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,877
Can you still give me
a ride afterwards?

465
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,880
Oh, I can't. I'm taking my parents
to the airport.

466
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,550
But Noah can give you a ride.

467
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,594
Convince him to do the booth.

468
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,514
You're gonna have to ask him
eventually.

469
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,250
We're having a party at my place
tonight if you guys want to come.

470
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,193
My parents aren't going to be home,
so there's gonna be drinks.

471
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,654
- My brother will be there, but you know.
- Hey.

472
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,784
I'll catch you guys later.

473
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:13,868
Bye.

474
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,370
He's so cute!

475
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,329
Hey.

476
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,373
Lee said that you're gonna give me a ride.

477
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,250
- Yeah.
- Where's your car?

478
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,131
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

479
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,216
Look, I have a spare helmet.
You'll be fine.

480
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,803
I'm not gonna get on that thing
like one of your make-out girls.

481
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,167
They don't all make out with me.

482
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,601
Okay, so like,

483
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,937
95% of them make out with me, but that is
clearly not what's happening here,

484
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,106
so if you could just
get on the damned bike please.

485
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,817
It's so beautiful outside,
I think I'm gonna go for a run.

486
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,111
- Are you serious? It's like five miles.
- What?

487
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,363
- Are you serious?
- I'm sorry. Can't hear you.

488
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,115
I'll see you at the party, okay?

489
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,576
No, you won't. I told you not to come.

490
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,369
Better get used to disappointment!

491
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,205

So nobody wants to work the booth.

513
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,640
Getting those A-listers
may be harder than I thought.

514
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,017
We need to up our game.
I really want to pull this off.

515
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,101
Cool.

516
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,188
You see? I told you she'd come.

Hey, Ellen! Come here!

518
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,904
The OMGs want to talk to me
twice in one week!

519
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,030
All right!

520
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,865
Oh, and tell Mia I'm awesome.

521
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,951
Yeah, for sure.

522
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:19,952
Hey!

523
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,871
Hey, girl!

524
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,373
What's Gucci?

525
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,960
You will love this.

526
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,253
Tastes like green.

527
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,255
Oh, no, I really don't drink.

528
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:31,590
Just shoot it, girl!

529
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,216
Go!

530
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,551
Get it, girl.

531
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:35,677
- Mmm!
- Ooh.

532
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:39,055
Wow! That does taste like green!

533
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,557
I know, right?

534
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:42,892
So have you asked him yet?

535
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,144
Asked who?

536
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,687
Flynn, silly!

537
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,981
About the booth.

538
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,775
Oh, he looks busy.

539
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,027
You're funny!

540
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,987
I love this hoe!

541
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,280
I love you!

542
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,698
- Go!
- Go!

543
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,283
- Right now?
- Go!

544
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,368
Okay!

545
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,870
Yes, honey! Get it!

546
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,838
I haven't seen Lee.

547
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,384
What?

548
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,763
The OMG Girls want to know
if you'll do our kissing booth.

549
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,056
No.

550
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,602
Okay, you win, Noah.
You want me to wash your motorcycle?

551
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,854
Polish your trophies?

552
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,982
Did you just put hands on me?

553
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,193
Easybake Oven is downstairs, bitch!

554
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,364
Okay, you should probably leave.

555
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:38,447
What?

556
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:43,286
She's like important to my family,
which kind of makes her important to me.

557
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,622
Are you for serious?

558
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,164
Leave.

559
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,840
Uh, sorry I ruined your make-out sesh.

560
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,469
Oh, it's fine.
She kind of tasted like Cheetos anyway.

561
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,346
That's gross.

562
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,140
So...

563
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,809
Kissing booth?

564
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,435
Absolutely not.

565
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:08,978
Awesome.

566
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,690
Oh, my God! That was so savage!

567
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,817
- That girl totally left!
- Yeah.

568
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:15,860
You'll love this.

569
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:16,944
Tastes like pink.

570
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,571
Ooh!

571
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,490
So, Flynn's still doing the booth?

572
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,368
Between us girls,

573
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:28,289

I'm taking this off.

00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,608

- No.

598
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:37,776
Who cares?

599
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,285
We should go skinny dipping!

600
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:50,246
- Absolutely!
- Yearbook!

601
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,165
- Yeah!

602
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:54,083

Here I come. I'm gonna...

605
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:11,184
Who is this? Are you... are you
a girl princess or a boy princess?

606
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,561
You smell good.

607
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,163
Oh, my God!

608
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:34,916
Oh, my God!

609
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,126
Oh, my God!

610
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,629
I'm in Noah's t-shirt!

611
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,632
Oh, no!

612
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,468
Dress is missing
but underwear is still on.

613
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,304
Okay. We can work with that.

614
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,732
Oh, sweet mercy!

615
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,025
Sorry.

616
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:03,902
It's okay.

617
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:07,240
I didn't mean to wake you.
I was just grabbing some clothes.

618
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,660
So, how bad was I?

619
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:14,789
You were about to strip on the pool table
in front of a bunch of guys

620
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,374
and then go skinny dipping.

621
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,335
I carried you out
before too much came off.

622
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,255
Oh, and you threw up on your dress.

623
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,383
Noah, I am so sorry.

624
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,263
It's okay. But I mean, this is exactly
what I was talking about, Shelly.

625
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,473
Oh, this is so embarrassing!

626
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:36,019
Oh, I hope I didn't snore.

627
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:38,855
Elle, I...

628
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,274
I slept in the guest room.

629
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,236
Oh, yeah.

630
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,238
Of course.

631
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,322
Okay.

632
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:53,745
I am assuming the t-shirt means
you saw me in my underwear?

633
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,663
- Yep.
- Oh, my God.

634
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,458
Oh, my God! Okay!

635
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,377
Shorts, please!

636
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,671
Can you... please?

637
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,048
Noah!

638
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,927
- Noah!
- All right, fine.

639
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,261
I'll just get it myself!

640
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,641
- Stop pulling!
- I'm not pulling anything!

641
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:17,018
Okay, well my arm is caught!
Let me just reach down and...

642
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,603
Oh, my God! I just touched it!

643
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:19,729
I said stop wiggling!

644
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,107
Sorry!

645
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,780
Aren't you forgetting something?

646
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:30,697
My t-shirt.

647
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,201
- Your t-shirt. Right. I'm sorry.
- Elle!

648
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,494
- What?
- Jesus!

649
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:35,870
I was kidding!

650
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,997
- So, I should...
- Just get out, dork.

651
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,083
Okay, yeah. Yeah.

652
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,628
Never let me drink again.

653
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,632
It's okay. I got it covered.

654
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,510
Made you an emergency survival kit.

655
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:56,391
Some granola, sports drinks, antacids,
and an epic dose of awkward shame!

656
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:57,976
Thank you.

657
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,605
Oh, and... really good work last night.

658
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,607
What do you mean?

659
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,819
You told everybody that Noah and the OMGs

660
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,570
would be doing the kissing booth.

661
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,616
Come on!

662
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:18,121
And even though I felt
like I was about to puke my liver out,

663
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,707
I couldn't stop thinking about Noah.

664
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,875
Our accidental groping.

665
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,421
It seemed like he just saw me
as a little sister,

666
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:31,175
but I couldn't help wondering if he had
a different reason for protecting me.

667
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,636
Listen, it's all about the OMGs.

668
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,880
We get them to do the booth,
everyone else will follow.

669
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:39,058
- Do you want to go over the plan again?
- No, I think I got it.

670
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,269
- Okay, wish me luck!
- Good luck.

671
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,602
Okay!

672
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,567
Have you guys seen this text?

673
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:53,613
Hey, Ellen!

674
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,118
Hey...

675
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,621
It's "Elle," actually. No "N."

676
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:04,459
Why are you standing and talking
instead of sitting and talking?

677
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,087
Oh, yeah, okay.

678
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,468
Ask Mia about me!

679
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,723
- Lee wants to know if you like him.
- Flynn's brother?

680
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,481
Yeah, he's cute.
Needs to learn to dress, though.

681
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,400
But more importantly,

682
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,403
everything's set
for the kissing booth, right?

683
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,032
Okay, so here's what I just heard.

684
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,161
Flynn likes one of you. Yeah.

685
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:44,791
And rumor has it that if the person
he likes is working the booth,

686
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,125
then he'll be there, too.

687
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,173
Wait! Didn't we tell you?

688
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,341
Tell me what?

689
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,301
Now that we're all besties,

690
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:59,680
we would totally do
the kissing booth, girl. Just for you.

691
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,808
- Really?
- You're one of us now, girl.

692
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:02,767
Totally!

693
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,268
- Thank you, guys.
- Sure!

694
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,104
You can call us bitches.

695
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:07,939
Thank you!

696
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:10,816
Bitches!

697
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:12,860
You're welcome!

698
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:16,114
So we've got a pretty solid line up now,

699
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,616
but we're still down
one Noah Flynn, though.

700
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,076
But let's focus on the booth.

701
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,744
I'm going to make the letters,

702
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,580
and then you are going to make
everything else. Okay?

703
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:28,709
We're only two days away from the carnival
so we need to move. Chop-chop!

704
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,353
Have I ever told you that you're bossy?

705
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,673
Yes, but then I told you
not to tell me that anymore.

706
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,342
- Ha-ha-ha. You're funny.
- I prefer the term "witty."

707
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,428
- I'm more of a slapstick guy myself.
- Really?

708
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,518
I am sorry. Was that the wrong color?

709
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,020
Oh, you're gonna...

710
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,406
Oh, you're so dead!

711
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,539
Hello.

712
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,811
Holy shit! She looks like
a hot Braveheart!

713
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,646
- You need to leave.
- Stop it!

714
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,315
I told you before, stop messing around.

715
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,816
I'll leave when I want to!

716
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,651
You're not the boss of me, Noah.

717
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:37,904
Yearbook!

718
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,660
I'll just delete this immediately.

719
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,996
Come on, let's just go, huh?

720
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,080
I mean it.

721
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,875
Now put your shirt on and get out.

722
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:54,629
What he said made sense.
It also meant he cared.

723
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,589
But what came out of my mouth was...

724
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:59,592
I told you to stop telling me what to do.

725
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,303
Oh!

726
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,393
Watch this, Noah Flynn.

727
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:17,943
Go, Elle!

728
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,698

Um, listen...

741
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:30,850
I know that we don't really see
eye-to-eye on things,

742
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,311
but I'm... I'm desperate.

743
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,106
So maybe if you could just
stop by the booth for a little.

744
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:38,941
I don't know. I just...

745
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,943
It would mean a lot to me.

746
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:42,736
Wow.

747
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,322
The independent Elle Evans

748
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,199
who doesn't want to be told what to do
by anyone,

749
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,869
is begging somebody else for help.

750
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,709
It is what it is, Noah.

751
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:01,630
I mean, I just really thought that maybe
it would be nice for you to do something

752
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,924
for people that care about you.

753
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:16,437
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen!

754
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,732
Come one, come all, behold the power
and raw intensity of a kiss

755

All sales and epic smooches are final!

759
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,923
As you may have noticed, there's
a slight twist to this kissing booth.

760
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:39,752
The people you will be kissing
are blindfolded!

761
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,671

794
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:47,796
But we do have one problem.

795
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,798
The girls are asking for Flynn,

796
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,885
and I have a solution.

797
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,853
Alrighty!

798
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:07,942
As promised, the next kisser is Flynn!

799
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,530
Hold on. That is not Flynn.

800
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,698
That is Lee Flynn.

801
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,373
The only reason I ever talked to that dork

802
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:25,834
was to make sure he'd get his brother
to come to the booth tonight.

803
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,254
Let's go.

804
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,514
I guess I'm next.

805
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:57,949
Oh.

806
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,536
I hope you like what you see.

807
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:10,044
Hey, Elle.

808
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,590
So, we're gonna hang out now.

809
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:15,426
Oh, but there's another hour left.

810
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,094
Okay.

811
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,471
Yeah.

812
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,890
Just don't do anything I wouldn't do.

813
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,561
All right, see you later.

814
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:31,650
Rule number 18: always be happy
for your bestie's successes.

815
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:34,903
For me, that one has always
been easy to follow.

816
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:36,071
No ways!

817
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,616
I can't.

818
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,159
What's wrong? Is everything okay?

819
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:44,079
Ew!

820
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:46,040
Imagine having to kiss that!

821
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,875
I can't do it! Not with him!

822
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:51,337
- Gross.
- It's payback time for lying about Flynn.

823
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,505
- Who? Who's out there?
- It's Olivia's ex.

824
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,133
And the problem is
we're all really good friends.

825
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:57,635
Right, Olivia?

826
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:58,719
Oh!

827
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:01,138
- Yeah.Totally.
- Yeah.

828
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,100
Say, Elle,

829
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,394
you don't know Olivia's ex at all, do you?

830
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:10,731
- No, well...
- Then it's solved!

831
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,651
Oh, no, Mia, please!
I don't think this is a good idea.

832
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,195
- Cutsies?
- What?

833
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:17,363
Cutsies.

834
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,686
- No, Mia!
- Time to get your dirty-girl on!

835
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,408
Thanks, dude.

836
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,826
Guys, I've never...

837
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,501
Sorry.

838
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,168
Oh, muscles!

839
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:37,007
Sorry. Okay. Thank you.

840
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,510
Oh, my God.

841
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,679
Sorry. I know that you were

842
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:46,308
probably expecting Olivia, so we don't
have to do anything if you don't want to.

843
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:50,062
Truth be told,
I've never kissed anyone before.

844
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:52,545
It's not that I haven't wanted to,
don't get me wrong.

845
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,858
For example, I punched Ron Getler

846
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,111
in the sixth grade
during Seven Minutes in Heaven.

847
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,114
Sophomore year, Spring Fling,

848
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,658
I was dancing with Randy Melrose.

849
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,576
You know, a romantic song came on.

850
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,287
I was like, "Oh, it's gonna happen!"
But... until...

851
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,081
it just didn't, cause...

852
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,337
This isn't so bad.

853
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:17,631
Not so bad at all.

854
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,340
Wait!

855
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,601

There...

865
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,897
Everyone... everyone just saw that,
didn't they?

866
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:17,107
Yup. Pretty much.

867
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,862
Oh, my God! Kill me now!

868
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:25,157
Come on. Relax, Shelly.
It was just a kiss.

869
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:29,578
Was it, Noah? Was it just a kiss?

870
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,163
Yeah. Of course.

871
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:33,915
All right.

872
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,044
So I'll... I'll see you around.

873
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,712
Noah! Noah! Noah!

874
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,255
Keep up the good work, huh?

875
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,302
"Good word?" What the...?

876
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,055
Oh.

877
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:50,849
"Good work."

878
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,352
And then it hit me.

879
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,563
Holy crap! What am I going to tell Lee?

880
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:06,031
That was really close.

881
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:07,115
Hey.

882
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:10,369
Oh, hey. I'll be right back, okay?
Oh! That was really close!

883
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,806
- Hey.
- Hey. Is everything okay?

884
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,166
Yeah, the booth is crushing it!

885
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,460
We have made more
than all the other booths combined.

886
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,462
- No way!
- It turns out people

887
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:22,339
really like to kiss!

888
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:23,422
What?

889
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:30,264
And get this:
I even wound up kissing your brother!

890
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,019
What?

891
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:41,525
Come on, Lee. It's no big deal. Seriously.

892
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:42,608
What?

893
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,112
It's for charity, right?

894
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:48,698
Yeah...

895
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,201
I guess so.

896
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:58,125
Just don't end up grinding coochies
with my brother,

897
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,419
or I'll literally never talk to you again.

898
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,214
That and Rule Number Nine, of course.

899
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,466
Of course! Right.

900
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,427
Come on, Lee. Seriously. As if.

901
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,038
As I ran home,

902
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:38,707
I wondered if our kiss
meant anything to Noah.

903
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,168
If I meant anything.

904
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:47,715
How about a ride?

905
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,095
Come on, Shelly.

906
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,765
You know my mom will kill me
if I leave you out here.

907
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,647
Holding on to Noah,

908
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:05,776
I couldn't stop thinking
about the promise I had made to Lee.

909
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,822
It's getting too dangerous.
I'm pulling over.

910
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,625
But who knows if Noah
even wanted to kiss me again.

911
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,836
That didn't really matter though.

912
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,883
Because I still wanted to kiss him.

913
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,933
You know, if we wait out this rain,
we should be fine.

914
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:57,911
Wait, no.

915
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:03,166
I cannot just be
another one of your conquests.

916
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,503
Is that what you think of me?

917
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,174
It's what everyone thinks of you.

918
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,359
You want to know the truth?

919
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:36,241
You are the only girl
who doesn't fall at my feet.

920
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:39,661
And it is driving me crazy.

921
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:45,125
It's one of the things I like about you.

922
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,209
You're sweet.

923
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:49,671
But you're not afraid
to call me out on things.

924
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:56,762
And here I was thinking I was just
your brother's annoying best friend.

925
00:50:57,846 --> 00:50:59,514
Well, yeah. There's that too.

926
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:04,978
Look, I don't know what all this means.

927
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,731
I just like hanging out with you.

928
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:10,484
It feels right.

929
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:13,779
I'm just...

930
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,656
I'm so confused right now.

931
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:31,630
Did that clear anything up?

932
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,094
No, I think we'd better try again.

933
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,856
- Security.
- Oh, my God! We're gonna die!

934
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,794
Is that you, Flynn?

935
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:56,613
I thought I told you not to bring girls
around here anymore.

936
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:57,696
What?

937
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,325
You just took me to your hookup spot?

938
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:02,786
No! You know what? Unbelievable!

939
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,248
Thanks, Andrew.

940
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:12,504
Still mad at you, but I am cold as shit!

941
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:14,506
And you are taking me home.

942
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:17,216
Now!

943
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:24,766
Thanks for the ride.

944
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:27,185
You know, I meant when I said, Elle.

945
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:28,352
Good for you.

946
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:31,565
So I'll see you tomorrow?

947
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:43,368
- Hey.
- Hey.

948
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,872
Why didn't Lee give you
a ride home tonight?

949
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:48,874
Um...

950
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,458
He just got busy.

951
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,169
But that is the only reason

952
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:54,880
you're on the back
of Noah Flynn's motorcycle, right?

953
00:52:57,257 --> 00:53:00,135
Of course. Duh. Come on.

954
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,015
In spite of what happened tonight,

955
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:08,310
I couldn't stop thinking
about what Noah said to me.

956
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,104
And even though I know I shouldn't,

957
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:13,857
how much I wanted to believe him.

958
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:23,742
Rule Number Six.

959
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:27,829
If you can't tell your best friend
about something you're doing,

960
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,873
you probably shouldn't be doing it.

Chug! Chug! Chug!

976
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,234
Looking good, Evans.

977
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,194
Oh, um...

978
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:24,403
Thanks.

979
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:27,407
We never did get to finish
your skinny dip at Flynn's party.

980
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,534
Oh, um...

981
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:33,163
I was just way too drunk that night, so...

982
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,415
- You know what you need?
- Hmm?

983
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,459
Hot tub. Come on.

984
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:38,877
Oh, no, that's okay, Warren.

985
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,760
- Come on, Evans. It'll be nice.
- No, Warren.

986
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:43,214
- Evans, come on! Don't make me beg.
- Warren?

987
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:45,467
- I'm not feeling well, Warren.
- She said no, Warren!

988
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,344
Okay. That's okay.

989
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:48,803
Okay. I'm fine.

990
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:51,848
It's all right. Can we... Can you just
take me home, please?

991
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:57,020
Okay. Just walk away. Hey, just walk away.

992
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,480
Let's go.

993
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,028
Hey, come on, man. It's all good.

994
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:07,489
I guess I'd also be pretty pissed
if I was slumming it

995
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:09,783
with my little brother's sloppy seconds.

996
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,287
Oh, shit!

997
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:28,801
Elle, wait!

998
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,344
Wait!

999
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:32,763
Elle!

1000
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:34,391
Just get in the car, Elle.

1001
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,103
Just get in the car, Elle.

1002
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,772
Get in the car, Elle!

1003
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,112
Please.

1004
00:56:58,289 --> 00:56:59,707
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

1005
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:05,088
What do you think? You think I meant
to fall for my brother's best friend?

1006
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,934
Wait, this isn't the way home.

1007
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:20,895
I want to show you something.

1008
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:34,617
How many girls have you made out with
in this spot?

1009
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,245
I only come here alone.

1010
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,249
Until now.

1011
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:46,629
Oh, you are good!

1012
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:49,507
That sounds so great when you say it.

1013
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:51,426
You must know that, right?

1014
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,386
Such a player.

1015
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:56,639
You haven't changed.

1016
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,185
I mean, what is the difference
between what just happened...

1017
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:01,936
The difference is you.

1018
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,147
You're crazy.

1019
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,940
I'm crazy about you, Elle.

1020
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,818
He is good.

1021
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:14,908
Okay.

1022
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,284
Okay.

1023
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,621
Here's how this is gonna work.

1024
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:23,666
Rules. Number one:

1025
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,127
No more fighting.

1026
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,253
Done.

1027
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:29,713
Number two:

1028
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,176
No more telling me what to do.

1029
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:34,844
Cross my heart.

1030
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,097
And number three:

1031
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:41,684
If we do this, nobody can know.

1032
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,686
Okay? At least until...

1033
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:46,940
I figure out a way to tell Lee.
It has to be that way.

1034
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,526
You know, you're cute when you're bossy.

1035
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:52,070
- I'm serious, Noah.
- So am I.

1036
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,823
You're really, really cute!

1037
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,458
Promise.

1038
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:07,417
Hey.

1039
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,213
I promise.

1040
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:38,323
Um...

1041
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,704
You know, we don't have to.

1042
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:38,551
You know when the time is right.

1043
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:41,054
And this was our time.

1044
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:46,434
Noah and his stupid, sexy smirk
got the best of me.

1045
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:48,519
And I was happy about it.

1046
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:51,481
But now what am I going to do?

1047
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,861
This is all your fault, kissing booth!

1048
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,923
Nope. No. Nope. Never work.

1049
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:00,550
What's wrong?

1050
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:03,219
We're supposed to be
in a logistics meeting right now. Okay?

1051
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:05,638
We're trying to figure out
how not to get caught.

1052
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,223
I don't see what the big deal is.

1053
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:09,684
It's not like anyone's gonna think
that I have a girlfriend.

1054
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:12,645
Oh, yeah, God forbid anyone
actually thinks you're in a relationship.

1055
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:14,981
Hey! I have my reputation to think of.

1056
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:16,940
Is that so?

1057
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:19,235
- Oh, 'tis so!
- Really?

1058
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:24,323
Shit! Hide!

1059
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:27,160
- Just a minute.
- I need to get your laundry.

1060
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:29,829
Go, go down there.
Yeah! Just one second, Mom!

1061
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:31,789
Hold on.

1062
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:32,874
Yup, come in

1063
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,168
Ew!

1064
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:37,795
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, Mom.

1065
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:41,841
You know, I could have brought
the laundry down.

1066
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:45,261
It's okay. I have an hour to kill before
your dad and I will meet the Andersons.

1067
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:49,182
Oh, no.

1068
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:51,017
Shit!

1069
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:03,029
Oh, and by the way, don't forget.

1070
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:05,323
We're going out on Saturday
to celebrate your big news.

1071
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:08,075
- We don't have to, Mom.
- Of course, we do.

1072
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:11,412
It's not every day you get accepted
to an Ivy League school.

1073
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:15,750
Oh! And I invited the Evanses.

1074
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:16,833
Do me a favor.

1075
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:18,961
Be sweet to Elle.

1076
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:20,838
She kind of has a crush on you.

1077
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:23,424
Really? I had no idea.

1078
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:26,135
Of course you didn't. Boys never do.

1079
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,224
Shut up!

1080
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:34,227
Elle has a crush on you.

1081
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,562
She's not even supposed to be here.

1082
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:41,067
I have to be downstairs in ten minutes
and work on the prom banner with Lee.

1083
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:43,318
Um...

1084
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:45,488
So, Ivy League school, huh?

1085
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:47,532
It's not a big deal.

1086
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:49,366
Which school?

1087
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:51,451
Harvard.

1088
01:03:53,037 --> 01:03:55,122
Are you shitting me?

1089
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:56,415
That's amazing!

1090
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:00,795
I don't even know
if I'm gonna go or not yet.

1091
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:06,968
Listen, you can't tell anybody
about this, okay?

1092
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:10,137
And that was the first time it hit me.

1093
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:13,683
Noah would be leaving for college. Soon.

1094
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:18,312
But we need to get you out of here,
and lucky for you,

1095
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:20,648
I've got your escape route
all figured out.

1096
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:21,731
Okay.

1097
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:29,282
You've got to be kidding me.

1098
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:31,742
Or we could just go tell Lee now.

1099
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:49,677
- Hey!
- Hey!

1100
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:51,721
Are you still wearing your clothes?

1101
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:54,432
Um... yes.

1102
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:58,728
Oh. Okay. I'll be down in a second.

1103
01:04:58,811 --> 01:04:59,811
Okay.

1104
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,775
Geronimo!

1105
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,799
Oh, hey, I think you got a text
from someone.

1106
01:05:10,823 --> 01:05:12,658
- I'll see who it is.
- That's okay. I got it.

1107
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,410
Lee, I said I'll get it.

1108
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:16,203
Why, is it from a boy?

1109
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:18,038
Yeah, right.

1110
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,718
Since when do you have a lock
on your phone?

1111
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:24,003
Um... little bro keeps getting into it.

1112
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:27,130

1120
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:03,709
Put your foot over the bike.

1121

Hey, this is great. I really needed this.

01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:41,200
Yeah, we really haven't been
hanging out much, right?

1165
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:45,204
You've been, like,
acting really weird recently.

1166
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:47,831
Wait.

1167
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:50,876
Is this because
you don't have a date to prom?

1168
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,587
Because if that's it,
you can come with Rachel and I.

1169
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:54,671
Um.

1170
01:08:54,713 --> 01:08:57,591
Stop lying to your best friend.
It's time.

1171
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:04,598
Lee, there is something
I wanted to tell you.

1172
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:07,101
- Hey, guys!
- Hey, you made it!

1173
01:09:07,184 --> 01:09:09,270
- Sorry. Traffic was crazy.
- Hey!

1174
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:10,353
Hey!

1175
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:13,357
So, it's okay if Elle comes to prom
with us, right?

1176
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,860
Absolutely! The more, the merrier!

1177
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:16,943
See?

1178
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:19,405
So, what was it you were saying?

1179
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:21,072
Oh, nothing.

1180
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:25,035
It was about prom. So...

1181
01:09:26,787 --> 01:09:28,706
- Okay. Off. My turn.
- Bully!

1182
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:30,124
Stupid.

1183
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:32,001
I swear to God. Says it right here.

1184
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:33,169
It's so her!

1185
01:09:35,796 --> 01:09:37,798
Hey, could you pass me the wrench, please?

1186
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:41,177
The little black tool box
on top of the shelf.

1187
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:42,636
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1188
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:49,100
Elle!

1189
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:57,610
When'd you become such a doctor?

1190
01:09:58,110 --> 01:09:59,612
Since I started getting into fights.

1191
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:02,823
You kind of learn to take care of yourself
when that happens.

1192
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,285
Why do you get in all those fights anyway?

1193
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:09,747
I think I...

1194
01:10:11,415 --> 01:10:13,918
I guess it's kind of just how I'm wired.

1195
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:16,837
I don't believe that.

1196
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:20,716
My parents even sent me to see
a couple of counselors.

1197
01:10:22,134 --> 01:10:25,221
But you know, we're all fucked up
one way or another, right?

1198
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,182
You could change.

1199
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:31,977
You think I can change?

1200
01:10:32,686 --> 01:10:33,896
You're Noah Flynn.

1201
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:38,359
I don't think there's much you can't do.

1202
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:41,737
Hey, Noah, have you seen Elle?

1203
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:46,866
Hey.

1204
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:48,744
What's going on in here?

1205
01:10:49,703 --> 01:10:51,080
Jesus! What happened your face?

1206
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:55,417
Oh, I had an accident
and Noah offered to help.

1207
01:10:58,295 --> 01:11:00,381
- Did you do that to her?
- What did you just say?

1208
01:11:00,464 --> 01:11:02,633
I said did you do that to her?
Did you hit Elle?

1209
01:11:02,716 --> 01:11:05,116
- You really think I'd hit her?
- I wouldn't put it past you.

1210
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:07,429
Hey, no. Lee, I'm fine.

1211
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:09,306
I just tripped in the garage.

1212
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:10,766
I was looking for you.

1213
01:11:15,729 --> 01:11:17,849
You really expect me to believe
that she just tripped?

1214
01:11:17,898 --> 01:11:20,276
- Get a clue, Lee! You weren't even here!
- I swear to God,

1215
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:22,945
- if you laid a hand on her....
- All right, that's it!

1216
01:11:23,028 --> 01:11:25,197
Noah! Hey! Stop! Noah! Stop!

1217
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:28,784
Look at me. Noah, look at me!

1218
01:11:33,664 --> 01:11:34,664
Come on.

1219
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:41,797
Is there something going on
between you two?

1220
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:44,382
What?

1221
01:11:44,591 --> 01:11:46,844
No, nothing is going on.

1222
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:50,263
Okay.

1223
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:51,681
Fine.

1224
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:54,685
But I really need to get out of here.

1225
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:56,729
Do you want to go downstairs
and start the car?

1226
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:58,314
I just need to grab my things.

1227
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:04,028
Look, I have to tell him tonight.

1228
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:06,280
Yeah.

1229
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:07,780
It's time.

1230
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:10,951
That way I can take you to prom.

1231
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:19,376
What the fuck?

1232
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:21,837
Lee, I can explain.

1233
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:23,422
Unbelievable.

1234
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:25,090
Wait, no. Lee. Lee, wait.

1235
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:27,843
Wait, Noah. Stay here, please.

1236
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:29,136
Let me handle this.

1237
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:34,183
Lee!

1238
01:12:34,266 --> 01:12:35,267
Lee, wait!

1239
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:37,728
Lee, wait! Wait.

1240
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:43,108
So this is what you've been
keeping from me?

1241
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:45,903
You were never meant to find out this way.

1242
01:12:45,986 --> 01:12:48,155
Seems I was never meant to find out
at all, doesn't it?

1243
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:50,616
Hey, lay off her, Lee.
It's not like it's all Elle's fault.

1244
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:52,618
You! Don't even get me started
on you, okay?

1245
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:55,371
Telling other guys to stay away from Elle
to protect her.

1246
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:58,534
And there you are, treating her like
some slut that you picked up at the club.

1247
01:12:58,957 --> 01:13:01,418
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

1248
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:05,005
So you're trying to tell me
that you two have not slept together.

1249
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:15,098
I knew it.

1250
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:19,019
So you really just have been fucking
my brother and lying to me.

1251
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,063
- No.
- Okay, Lee. That is enough.

1252
01:13:21,146 --> 01:13:24,274
No, it's not enough. She has no clue
what she's gotten herself into with you!

1253
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:27,069
This is bullshit.
You're acting like a hurt, little bitch.

1254
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,866
- Noah, get off of him!
- Stop!

1255
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:34,451
- Noah, get off of him!
- Calm down!

1256
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:38,038
That is enough! Calm down! I'm not
letting you go until you chill out!

1257
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:39,748
- Get off of me!
- Chill out!

1258
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:42,418
- Get off!
- Get off him! Get off!

1259
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:43,544
Please!

1260
01:13:43,627 --> 01:13:44,627
Stop!

1261
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:57,890
Here.

1262
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:06,107
Please.

1263
01:14:08,485 --> 01:14:09,862
Please, Lee!

1264
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:12,865
Stop, Lee! Please!

1265
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:14,741
Lee, please!

1266
01:14:15,909 --> 01:14:18,036
Please, Lee, don't leave like this.

1267
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:20,247
So much for Rule Number Nine, huh?

1268
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:22,458
I didn't mean for this to happen.

1269
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,505
You know, my whole life,

1270
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:34,261
Noah has gotten everything
that he has ever wanted.

1271
01:14:37,222 --> 01:14:41,018
The only thing that I had
that he didn't....

1272
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:43,436
was you.

1273
01:14:47,941 --> 01:14:49,776
And now he has that too.

1274
01:14:51,111 --> 01:14:52,111
Lee.

1275
01:14:53,363 --> 01:14:54,406
It's okay.

1276
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:57,868
You two deserve each other.

1277
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:06,375
Elle.

1278
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:09,213
Look, it's okay. He'll get over it.

1279
01:15:11,548 --> 01:15:13,967
Why? Why did you come downstairs?

1280
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:16,136
I told you to stay inside!

1281
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:18,263
Like you wanted to make things worse!

1282
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:21,975
What is wrong with you?

1283
01:15:22,976 --> 01:15:25,562
You can not pin all this on me.

1284
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:30,943
Just leave me alone.

1285
01:15:33,153 --> 01:15:34,238
No problem.

1286
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:40,953
Some people say you'll fall in love.

1287
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:43,580
And that's the person
you'll spend forever with.

1288
01:15:45,457 --> 01:15:49,169
They'll be the one who, no matter what,
you can't live without.

1289
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:52,005
But at that moment

1290
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:54,091
all I cared about was Lee.

1291
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:57,553
And I was pretty sure
I'd lost him forever.

1292
01:16:07,604 --> 01:16:08,604
Hey.

1293
01:16:09,022 --> 01:16:10,023
Hey.

1294
01:16:13,318 --> 01:16:15,195
There's someone here to see you.

1295
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:16,779
Lee?

1296
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:21,576
Hi, Elle.

1297
01:16:24,621 --> 01:16:26,456
I was hoping maybe we could talk.

1298
01:16:34,798 --> 01:16:36,758
There's really nothing to talk about.

1299
01:16:38,218 --> 01:16:41,179
I'm just really sorry for lying to Lee
about Noah and...

1300
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,891
Now I've ruined our friendship.

1301
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:50,105
Elle, I was friends with your mom
for over 20 years.

1302
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:53,483
She was my best, best friend.

1303
01:16:54,067 --> 01:16:56,570
But if you think
that we didn't fight sometimes,

1304
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:58,447
you got another thing coming.

1305
01:16:59,197 --> 01:17:00,115
Really?

1306
01:17:00,198 --> 01:17:01,198
Sure.

1307
01:17:01,992 --> 01:17:06,705
But you know, I can't really remember
what a single fight was really about.

1308
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:09,374
But what I do remember

1309
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,628
is that we always forgave each other.

1310
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:16,048
It doesn't really feel like that
right now.

1311
01:17:16,506 --> 01:17:17,758
Don't give up on him.

1312
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:23,597
You're lucky if you can get even one
really good best friend in your life.

1313
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:28,310
You just have to figure out
how to make it right.

1314
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:37,861
I gotta admit, the next couple
of weeks were pretty lonely.

1315
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:42,032
Noah was totally MIA.

1316
01:17:42,115 --> 01:17:44,493
His attendance at school got so bad,

1317
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:46,495
he was in danger of not graduating.

1318
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:49,247
Worst of all,

1319
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:52,334
Lee was completely ignoring me.

1320
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:57,214
At least Dad had forgiven me.
He even paid for my driving lessons.

1321
01:17:57,839 --> 01:18:00,342
Decided it was about time
I got my license.

1322
01:18:03,136 --> 01:18:04,930
Then one day it hit me.

1323
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:10,102
Holy crap! Rule Number Seven!

1324
01:18:11,728 --> 01:18:14,064
No matter how mad you are
at your best friend,

1325
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:17,067
you have to forgive them
if they give you ice cream.

1326
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:20,278
I'm sorry.

1327
01:18:47,305 --> 01:18:48,557
Hey, Mr. Evans.

1328
01:18:57,190 --> 01:18:58,316
Where have you been, Noah?

1329
01:19:00,485 --> 01:19:01,820
I had to get away and think.

1330
01:19:02,362 --> 01:19:03,362
I'm...

1331
01:19:03,947 --> 01:19:05,115
I'm on my way home now.

1332
01:19:05,198 --> 01:19:06,198
Good.

1333
01:19:07,284 --> 01:19:08,702
Listen, Elle's not here.

1334
01:19:10,495 --> 01:19:12,247
I'm actually here to talk to you.

1335
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:15,166
Oh?

1336
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:17,293
I just...

1337
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:19,921
I wanted to apologize.

1338
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:22,007
About everything.

1339
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:24,301
I shouldn't have let it happen.

1340
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:26,052
It was all my fault.

1341
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:27,928
Not Elle's.

1342
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,601
But I'm not sorry that it did happen.

1343
01:19:32,684 --> 01:19:35,061
Or for the way that I feel
about your daughter.

1344
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:38,939
Oh, Noah.

1345
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:43,528
I can't say I support the two of you.
I can't.

1346
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:46,573
But it's got to be Elle's choice.

1347
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:51,077
I just think that Elle is gonna have
to figure out what's best for Elle.

1348
01:19:53,413 --> 01:19:54,413
I understand.

Hey... so I have been thinking
about our birthday party after prom,

1369
01:22:07,213 --> 01:22:11,301
and I was leaning towards
like a costume party, maybe?

1370
01:22:11,384 --> 01:22:12,510
- Hells yes!
- Yes.

1371
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:13,595
Come on, you know me.

1372
01:22:13,678 --> 01:22:15,764
Any excuse to cross-dress and I'm in!

You have fun tonight. Okay, Ellie-bear?

Hello, Los Angeles Country Day Prom!

1398
01:24:40,992 --> 01:24:43,995
Now, I'd like to introduce
this year's theme:

1399
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:45,371
Memories.

1400
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:48,500
Photographs which show
images of great moments

1401
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:51,086
from a truly fantastic year.

1402
01:24:51,836 --> 01:24:53,505
The moments that stood out

1403
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:56,591
and helped to define
who we are as a class.

1404
01:24:57,425 --> 01:24:59,803
It's a final look back on who we were,

1405
01:25:00,553 --> 01:25:05,141
at the very moment that we're looking
forward to who we want to become.

1406
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:12,273
So, for everyone out there,

1407
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:14,859

I'm sorry, Noah.

01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:32,079
I can't.

1454
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:34,082
No, Elle, wait, please!

1455
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:35,540

1461
01:27:54,352 --> 01:27:55,395
And standing here,

1462
01:27:56,604 --> 01:27:58,314
in front of everyone,

1463
01:27:59,148 --> 01:28:00,149
I'm telling you

1464
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:02,402
that I love you.

1465
01:28:08,741 --> 01:28:09,909
I'm sorry.

1466
01:28:10,994 --> 01:28:11,994
I just...

1467
01:28:12,412 --> 01:28:16,332
I can't keep hurting people
that I care about because of you.

1468
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,335
Okay? Nobody wants us to be together.

1469
01:28:21,671 --> 01:28:23,131
Well, that may be true.

1470
01:28:25,717 --> 01:28:27,260
But what do you want?

1471
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:30,804
I want...

1472
01:28:41,399 --> 01:28:42,400
I want to go.

1473
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:43,483
Elle.

1474
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:09,927
Hey, Elle! Wait up!

1475
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:55,680
Hey.

1476
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:00,560
Hey.

1477
01:30:05,358 --> 01:30:06,358
Listen.

1478
01:30:07,443 --> 01:30:10,947
I just came to say I'm sorry about
what happened on the lawn the other day.

1479
01:30:11,989 --> 01:30:13,533
And for everything with Elle.

1480
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:16,828
I never should have been lying to you.

1481
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:19,372
But I wanted you to know that...

1482
01:30:20,039 --> 01:30:21,666
I was never playing Elle.

1483
01:30:23,042 --> 01:30:25,545
And I meant everything
that I said to her tonight.

1484
01:30:30,716 --> 01:30:32,343
And not that you care,

1485
01:30:34,637 --> 01:30:36,472
but I'm leaving for Boston tomorrow.

1486
01:30:38,474 --> 01:30:41,978
I figured I'd try to get settled in
before the fall term. You know?

1487
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:47,691
All right.

1488
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:50,486
Well, I'll see you around, eh?

1489
01:30:53,489 --> 01:30:54,489
Oh, and...

1490
01:30:58,619 --> 01:30:59,912
Happy birthday, man.

1491
01:31:08,212 --> 01:31:09,964
Rachel's getting here in ten minutes.

1492
01:31:11,090 --> 01:31:12,467
Is Noah gonna be here tonight?

1493
01:31:13,092 --> 01:31:16,053
He told me last night
he was leaving for Harvard today.

1494
01:31:18,431 --> 01:31:20,349
He just didn't want to be around here.

1495
01:31:21,642 --> 01:31:23,102
But hey, it's for the best.

1496
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:25,480
I mean, I think you did the right thing.

1497
01:31:27,565 --> 01:31:28,565
Don't you?

1498
01:31:31,277 --> 01:31:32,277
Yeah.

1499
01:31:42,955 --> 01:31:44,290
So, what'd you wish for?

1500
01:31:44,373 --> 01:31:46,083
No, you know the rules.

1501
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:47,918
Rule Number One:

1502
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:51,797
Only your best friend
gets to know your birthday wishes.

1503
01:31:53,466 --> 01:31:54,466
So, how about you?

1504
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:56,260
No wish this year.

1505
01:31:59,138 --> 01:32:00,181
Okay.

1506
01:32:40,012 --> 01:32:41,681
Hey!

1507
01:32:42,598 --> 01:32:43,683
Where you going?

1508
01:32:44,976 --> 01:32:46,477
I can't keep doing this.

1509
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:47,562
Doing what?

1510
01:32:54,944 --> 01:32:55,945
Elle, what's wrong?

1511
01:32:57,488 --> 01:32:58,488
Hey!

1512
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:00,283
You're acting all weird.

1513
01:33:05,204 --> 01:33:06,455
I love you.

1514
01:33:08,291 --> 01:33:10,293
And I always, always

1515
01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:12,169
want to be close to you.

1516
01:33:14,463 --> 01:33:16,465
But being my best friend

1517
01:33:17,133 --> 01:33:20,845
doesn't give you the right
to tell me who I can love.

1518
01:33:21,345 --> 01:33:22,680
It's like with Rachel.

1519
01:33:23,055 --> 01:33:26,601
What if I didn't like having her around?
What would you do then?

1520
01:33:27,393 --> 01:33:29,520
- I guess I'd break up with her.
- No, you see?

1521
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:33,399
You shouldn't have to do that just
because I didn't want you to be with her.

1522
01:33:33,482 --> 01:33:34,567
No. Come on, Elle.

1523
01:33:34,650 --> 01:33:36,890
This isn't the same thing as with Noah
and you know that.

1524
01:33:36,944 --> 01:33:38,613
Okay. Listen to me, Lee.

1525
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:42,366
We made up our rules when we were six.

1526
01:33:43,576 --> 01:33:44,577
What are you saying?

1527
01:33:47,538 --> 01:33:49,915
I'm saying that I love Noah.

1528
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:51,751
And I want him.

1529
01:33:52,793 --> 01:33:54,670
And I'm sorry if that hurts you,

1530
01:33:54,754 --> 01:33:57,798
and I'm so sorry
that I lied to you before.

1531
01:33:58,633 --> 01:33:59,633
I was wrong.

1532
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:04,263
But I'd be lying to you again
if I didn't tell you that I love him

1533
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:06,682
with every bit of my heart.

1534
01:34:08,267 --> 01:34:10,394
And if you just can't accept that,

1535
01:34:12,688 --> 01:34:13,688
then...

1536
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:21,072
Then maybe you can't be part of my life.

1537
01:34:30,247 --> 01:34:32,083
I think you're making a big mistake.

1538
01:34:34,335 --> 01:34:36,212
Then that's my decision to make.

1539
01:34:40,633 --> 01:34:41,633
You're right.

1540
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:45,930
I love you, Elle,
and I just want you to be happy.

1541
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:47,640
Thank you!

1542
01:34:52,269 --> 01:34:53,269
Okay.

1543
01:34:53,813 --> 01:34:56,023
I have to find him. Like now.

1544
01:34:56,107 --> 01:34:57,858
It's okay. I'll help you find him, okay?

1545
01:34:57,942 --> 01:35:00,653
Okay, let me go just make sure
my dad knows where I'm going, okay?

1546
01:35:00,736 --> 01:35:02,905
Meet you outside in five,
and you can drive the Stang.

1547
01:35:02,988 --> 01:35:05,241
- Thank you. I love you so much! Thank you!
- Go!

1548
01:35:08,244 --> 01:35:09,244
Here we go!

1549
01:35:10,454 --> 01:35:12,415
Thank you for doing this, by the way.

1550
01:35:12,498 --> 01:35:13,499
No problem.

1551
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:15,500
You know,

1552
01:35:15,751 --> 01:35:19,714
I think the hardest part
was just seeing Noah's face at prom.

1553
01:35:19,797 --> 01:35:21,757
Gosh, I wish I had just told him then.

1554
01:35:22,216 --> 01:35:23,843
But you know what? No matter

1555
01:35:24,468 --> 01:35:27,847
how he feels now, I've just gotta find him
and tell him how I feel.

1556
01:35:29,348 --> 01:35:30,348
You just did.

1557
01:35:33,519 --> 01:35:34,519
Oh, my God!

1558
01:35:35,354 --> 01:35:38,232
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, Jesus, woman! Pull over!

1559
01:35:38,315 --> 01:35:40,151
Pull over! Pull the car over!

1560
01:35:40,234 --> 01:35:42,653
- My God! You're trying to kill us!
- Oh, my God!

1561
01:35:43,487 --> 01:35:45,156
I was not expecting that!

1562
01:35:45,823 --> 01:35:47,658
Oh, my God! Like, what?

1563
01:35:49,452 --> 01:35:50,494
Hi!

1564
01:35:51,245 --> 01:35:52,955
I thought you were leaving
for Harvard.

1565
01:35:54,832 --> 01:35:56,751
Yeah, I was planning to, but...

1566
01:35:58,627 --> 01:36:01,380
I decided I had to see you
one last time before I went.

1567
01:36:02,673 --> 01:36:03,673
Noah.

1568
01:36:05,468 --> 01:36:08,262
And then Lee came upstairs
and he told me everything.

1569
01:36:08,679 --> 01:36:10,723
And the old switcheroo was his idea?

1570
01:36:11,599 --> 01:36:13,768
- It was like a classic Lee, huh?
- Yeah!

1571
01:36:13,851 --> 01:36:16,479
He said something
about Rule Number 18 or whatever.

1572
01:36:17,271 --> 01:36:18,689
Rule Number 18:

1573
01:36:19,273 --> 01:36:22,485
Always be happy
for your bestie's successes.

1574
01:36:23,027 --> 01:36:25,488
Yeah. Classic Lee.

1575
01:36:27,364 --> 01:36:29,408
Thanks for staying a little longer.

1576
01:36:29,492 --> 01:36:32,369
Well, I had to see you blow out
the candles on your cake.

1577
01:36:33,078 --> 01:36:35,122
Happy birthday to me.

1578
01:36:39,668 --> 01:36:41,045
So, what about Harvard?

1579
01:36:41,629 --> 01:36:43,309
I don't want to talk about that right now.

1580
01:36:45,716 --> 01:36:50,346
You know, I want to know what it was
that you wanted to tell me.

1581
01:36:52,848 --> 01:36:54,266
Um...

1582
01:36:59,522 --> 01:37:02,608
Sitting here in front of...

1583
01:37:04,151 --> 01:37:06,237
no one in particular,

1584
01:37:11,492 --> 01:37:13,118
I'm saying I love you.

1585
01:37:16,455 --> 01:37:17,455
And I love you.

1586
01:37:33,848 --> 01:37:36,392
The next few weeks
before Noah left for school

1587
01:37:36,767 --> 01:37:38,936
we spent every spare minute together...

1588
01:37:40,479 --> 01:37:42,106
up to the very last second.

1589
01:37:48,445 --> 01:37:49,445
Goodbye.

1590
01:37:49,905 --> 01:37:51,907
Come on, Shelly. Don't say it like that.

1591
01:37:51,991 --> 01:37:54,076
I'll see you soon,
and you can come and visit.

1592
01:37:54,785 --> 01:37:57,037
- And we can make this work.
- Okay, stop.

1593
01:37:57,580 --> 01:37:58,873
Don't say anything.

1594
01:37:59,415 --> 01:38:02,126
I just want to be with you
for a few seconds more.

1595
01:38:02,585 --> 01:38:04,712
You are cute when you're being bossy!

1596
01:38:07,381 --> 01:38:09,717
And don't turn back for a final wave.

1597
01:38:10,509 --> 01:38:12,761
That is way too cheesy and romantic.

1598
01:38:13,637 --> 01:38:14,637
Even for me.

1599
01:38:30,821 --> 01:38:31,821
Okay.

1600
01:38:45,002 --> 01:38:46,002
See you.

1601
01:38:57,598 --> 01:39:00,142
Maybe things really would work out
with Noah.

1602
01:39:02,353 --> 01:39:03,646
I hoped they would.

1603
01:39:12,696 --> 01:39:14,239
But maybe they wouldn't.

1604
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:21,413
And no matter how much I wanted it,

1605
01:39:22,831 --> 01:39:25,584
things couldn't stay
the way they were forever.

1606
01:39:26,377 --> 01:39:27,962
But whatever happened,

1607
01:39:28,671 --> 01:39:30,339
I knew there was a part of me

1608
01:39:30,422 --> 01:39:32,925
that was always
going to belong to Noah Flynn.

1609
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:36,053
A little piece of my heart

1610
01:39:36,595 --> 01:39:38,681

1611
01:39:40,057 --> 01:39:41,350
And for the first time,

1612
01:39:44,103 --> 01:39:46,271
everything suddenly seemed...

1613
01:39:47,439 --> 01:39:48,439
possible.

1614
01:39:52,778 --> 01:39:54,655
But it's funny when I think about it.

1615
01:39:56,907 --> 01:39:58,659
Because all this happened

1616
01:39:59,618 --> 01:40:01,996
just because of a kissing booth.
