1
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,282
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

2
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,004
It's been, uh, 24 hours
since my last confession.

3
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,687
Son, it's so late.

4
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,610
Yeah, Father. Work has just...

5
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,683
I lied to Connie. Uh, to my wife.

6
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,420
This is very serious.

7
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,681
I know.

8
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,900
I promised her I'd quit smoking.

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,020
She thinks it's bad for me.

10
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,327
And I'm trying, but...

11
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,920
I snuck a couple of cigarettes.

12
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,965
Maybe three.

13
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,681
Yes.

14
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,680
It's so hard.

15
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,806
Yes.

16
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,644
But I'm trying.

17
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,168
It is 5:00 a.m.

18
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,523
Still shank of night for some.

19
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,570
But for Eddie Mannix,
beginning of a new work day.

20
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,803
The movie studio for which
he works manufactures stories,

21
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,849
each its own day-lit drama
or moonlit dream.

22
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,020
But the work of Eddie Mannix
cares not for day or night.

23
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,522
And cares little for his rest.

24
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,140
That's right, doll face.
Churn that butter for me.

25
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,241
Atta girl.

26
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,500
Oh, Jesus Christ on a scooter!

27
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,647
You here?

28
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,500
The studio has the rights
to Gloria's likeness, Falco.

29
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,260
Give me the negatives
and things will go easier on you.

30
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,771
These are for private use, Eddie.

31
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,046
Come on.

32
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,801
Oh, boy.

33
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,125
Can't a girl take a few pictures,
have a few laughs?

34
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,284
Jeez, Eddie! What an old stick in the mud.

35
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,681
Now, you listen to me.

36
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,540
You were at a party,
had too much to drink.

37
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,860
Somebody brought you here,
you don't remember who.

38
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,300
You're going home now.

39
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,368
Your name's Mary Jo Scheinbrotte.

40
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,130
Okay, Eddie.
So, Eddie Mannix.

41
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,486
Saw your heap outside.

42
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,047
Got a call. Loud, disorderly.

43
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,282
Possible French postcard situation.

44
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,740
Someone was pulling your leg.

45
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,808
Mary Jo here was just at a costume party.

46
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,564
It's not really her dirndl.

47
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,688
She wants to contribute something
to your pension fund.

48
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,810
Sorry to drag you out in the rain.

49
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,803
Well, say, no problem at all.

50
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,730
Aren't you Gloria DeLamour?

51
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,207
No, no, I'm Mary Jo something.

52
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,540
Scheinbrotte.

53
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,931
Say, Brian.

54
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,689
Can I bum a cigarette?

55
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,940
Ancient Rome.

56
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,887
Twelve years into the rule
of Tiberius, Ruler Maximus.

57
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,840
Rome's legions are masters of the world.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,401
The stomp of its sandals heard from

59
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,921
the Iberian Peninsula in the west,

60
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,369
through the halls of the great
library of Alexandria in the east.

61
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,524
As oppressed people everywhere
writhe under the Roman lash,

62
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,527
freeman and vassal are united
in one compulsory worship.

63
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,568
The emperor, Caesar, is Godhead.

64
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,405
Lord of every man's body and spirit.

65
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,204
For those who will not submit,

66
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,729
the galleys, the arenas,
even crucifixion await.

67
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,300
But there is a new wind
blowing from the east,

68
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,500
from the dusty streets of Bethlehem,

69
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,286
that will soon challenge
the vast house of Caesar,

70
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,060
that edifice wrought of brick and blood

71
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,970
which now seems so secure.

72
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,841
Ha!

73
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,009
There she is, Gracchus.

74
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,369
Ah, what a beauty.

75
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,842
Aye, Autolochus. Rome.

76
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,820
Suckled by a she-wolf and nurturing us,
her sons, in turn.

77
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,660
Tonight I bathe in Caracalla

78
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,766
and wash away the dust
of 300 miles of Frankish road.

79
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,441
To Rome.

80
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,201
To Rome!

81
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,643
Yes, to Rome!

82
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,162
Glorious center of Caesar's rule.

83
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,328
But far away in Palestine,
another man is coming home.

84
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,020
Saul, humble merchant of Tarsus

85
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,966
is about to be struck down by a vision.

86
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,805
What thing is this?

87
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,163
Gloria DeLamour has been checked into

88
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,420
Our Lady of Perpetual Rest to dry out.
Uh-huh.

89
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,060
You have a 10:00 a.m.
with Monsignor O'Reilly

90
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,780
at the Wallace Beery Conference Room,
and he's bringing in a Lester Silkwood

91
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,530
from the Legion of Catholic Decency.

92
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,088
And we've also invited Patriarch
Vlassos for the Eastern view.

93
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,685
Have they read the script?
Roger.

94
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,900
Let's also invite a rabbi
and a Protestant padre of some sort

95
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,180
so we can get everybody's two cents.

96
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,260
Check.

97
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,885
How's production on Tucumcari?

98
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,020
Principal is on schedule,
but second unit has been idle

99
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,620
in Gallup, New Mexico for four days.

100
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,780
Heavy rain.

101
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,460
Forecast?
Not good.

102
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,980
Send an insert truck, have them shoot
driving plates for Came the Rain.

103
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,180
Check.

104
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,660
Jonah's Daughter still behind?

105
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,420
Yes. Uh, director says the problem
is DeeAnna, and she's getting worse.

106
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,020
I know what it is.
I'll drop in on her after my 10 o'clock.

107
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,451
All right, let's call New York.

108
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,251
Mr. Schenk's office, line two.

109
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,361
Hi, Dorothy. Eddie Mannix. The old man in?

110
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,620
Natalie, I want the box office
on The Debonaires and on Blessed Event.

111
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,088
Can you also... Yes!
Good morning, Mr. Schenk.

112
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,924
Very well. Thank you.

113
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,208
Proceeding. You know, proceeding.

114
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,647
Yeah, Merrily We Dance
starts shooting today.

115
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,406
Beardly Auberon gave us a draft
that's extremely classy.

116
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,724
Joan Van Vechten's playing Dierdre, but
we need a male lead and we need him now.

117
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,520
No, Jack Hogarth is drying out at Cedars.

118
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,651
Metro won't lend us Gable unless
we give them the Comiskey twins.

119
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,482
Of course not. I agree.

120
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,643
What?

121
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,768
Hobie Doyle? Do you really think so?

122
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,460
After all, he's a dust actor.

123
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,927
The man barely knows how to talk.

124
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,260
Yes, of course, Mr. Schenk, I agree,
but I don't know if Hobie Doyle

125
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,601
has the poise in a dinner jacket.

126
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,610
Yes, we do need someone pronto.

127
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,930
No, I don't, that's very true.

128
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,923
But let me talk to Laurence Laurentz,
the director.

129
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,605
It could work. It could work.

130
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,808
Hobie Doyle is a very promising idea.

131
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,126
Whitey!

132
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,405
And cut!

133
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,800
Great, Hobie.

134
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,325
I can do the handstand smoother
if you give me another shot at her.

135
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,324
We got four good ones,
Hobie, and Whitey's tired.

136
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,380
Okay, you're the boss man.

137
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,562
If that's lunch,
I'm gonna grab me a plate of beans.

138
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,020
All right, kids, this is Rome.

139
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,849
You're over at this
guy's house for a revel.

140
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,530
And in comes Antoninus.

141
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,648
Lots of energy.

142
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,488
What are you doing at the table of viands?

143
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,420
You're supposed to be
reclining with the lyre.

144
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,660
I'm sorry, I was just...

145
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,841
Recline with the lyre.

146
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,362
Don't sit on the pediment. Recline.

147
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,766
Relaxed, festive.

148
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,660
Extras set?
Set!

149
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,820
Roll sound!

150
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,940
I got my eye on you.

151
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,610
Roll camera. Fountain!

152
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,209
Hail, Caesar! Ten-apple, take 10.

153
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,290
And action!

154
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,220
Autolochus!

155
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,324
I had heard rumors of your return to Rome.

156
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,447
More than rumors, noble Sestimus.

157
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,331
I see that you are the same
worshipper of Bacchus.

158
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,766
What gaiety.

159
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,645
There is still truth in the adage
"What pleasures cannot be found

160
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,561
"in the villa of Sestimus Amydias
cannot be found in Rome!"

161
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,961
But seriously, there is talk the Senate
will send our legions out again,

162
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,964
and this time not on
a short march to Gaul.

163
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,366
What truth to these mutterings, Sestimus?

164
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,490
The matter has been
taken up in the Senate.

165
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,288
It seems that there
is unrest in Palestine.

166
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,641
Palestine?

167
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,001
That backwater!

168
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,740
They'll hardly be sending the sixth legion
to that godforsaken patch of desert!

169
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,966
Palestine!

170
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,211
Palestine!

171
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,161
Ah.

172
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,724
Holding for a dissolve...

173
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,769
Still laughing...

174
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,530
Holding...

175
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,521
And cut!

176
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,130
Fine, boys. That was just fine.

177
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,481
Was I okay? Was I all right?

178
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,620
That's a cut!

179
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,940
We're gonna move on to the brazier scene.

180
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,042
Was I all right with the "mutterings"?
It felt a little...

181
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,420
No, no, no, no, it's fine.

182
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,140
Moving on, brazier scene, 20 minutes.

183
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,420
Popping over to the trailer.

184
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,047
Okay. In the brazier scene,
they changed "passion" to "ardor."

185
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,980
What? Why? I liked "passion."

186
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,401
It's strong. It's passion!

187
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,684
"Such is my greeting after
three months' sojourn in Gaul?

188
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,845
"Not so, Ursulina."

189
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,169
"My ardor...

190
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,980
"My ardor is yet as warm

191
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,367
"as the embers of this brazier.

192
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,090
"Embers of this brazier."

193
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,500
We're ready for you, Mr. Whitlock!

194
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,682
"Not so, Sperm-ulina."

195
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,684
Gentlemen, thank you all for coming.

196
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,529
I know you have parishes, flocks and temples
making enormous demands on your time.

197
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,370
But I'm sure you appreciate also
that great masses of humanity

198
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,285
look to pictures for
information and uplift

199
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,568
and, yes, entertainment.

200
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,122
Now, here at Capitol Pictures,
as you know,

201
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,807
an army of technicians and actors
and top-notch artistic people

202
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,203
are working hard to bring
to the screen the story of the Christ.

203
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,731
It's a swell story.

204
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,740
A story told before, yes,
but we like to flatter ourselves

205
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,929
that it's never been told
with this kind of distinction and panache.

206
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,402
Perhaps, sir,
you forget its telling in the Holy Bible.

207
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,020
Quite right, Patriarch.
The Bible, of course, is terrific.

208
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,770
But for millions of people, pictures will
be their reference point for the story.

209
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,220
The story's embodiment, the story's, uh...

210
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,060
Realization.

211
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,300
You "realize," of course,
that for we Jews,

212
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,246
any visual depiction of the Godhead
is most strictly prohibited.

213
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,641
Oh.

214
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,767
But, of course, for us,
the man Jesus Nazarene is not God.

215
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,921
A-ha!

216
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,765
Who plays Christ?

217
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,620
Oh, a kid we're all very excited about.

218
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,820
Todd Hocheiser.

219
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,481
Wonderful young actor we found in Akron,
Ohio, in a nationwide talent hunt.

220
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,210
But Hocheiser is seen only fleetingly
and with extreme taste.

221
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,523
Our story is told through
the eyes of a Roman tribune.

222
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,762
Autolochus Antoninus.

223
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,281
Ordinary man, skeptical at first,

224
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,964
but who comes to a grudging respect
for this swell figure from the East.

225
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,647
And Autolochus is played by

226
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,964
Baird Whitlock.

227
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,441
Oh, my.

228
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,446
Well, he is certainly a great talent.

229
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,810
Now, Hail, Caesar! is a prestige picture,
our biggest release of the year,

230
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,220
and we're devoting huge resources
to its production

231
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,727
in order to make it first-class
in every respect.

232
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,201
Gentlemen, given its enormous expense,

233
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,323
we don't wanna send it to market
except in the certainty

234
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,380
that it will not offend any reasonable
American regardless of faith or creed.

235
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,780
Now that's where you come in.
You've read the script.

236
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,081
I wanna know if the theological elements
of the story are up to snuff.

237
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,322
I thought the chariot scene was fakey.

238
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,324
How is he going to jump from one chariot
to the other going full speed?

239
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,580
Uh-huh.

240
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,808
Well, we can look at that.

241
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,900
But as for the religious aspect,

242
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,606
does the depiction
of Christ Jesus cut the mustard?

243
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,730
Well, the nature of Christ is not quite as
simple as your photoplay would have it.

244
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,900
How so, Father?

245
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,243
It's not the case simply
that Christ is God, or God Christ.

246
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,500
You can say that again.

247
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,045
The Nazarene was not God.

248
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,340
He was not not-God.

249
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,580
He was a man.
Part God.

250
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,740
No, sir.

251
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,820
But, Rabbi, all of us
have a little bit of God in us, don't we?

252
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,900
Well...

253
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,740
It's the foundation of our belief

254
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,686
that Christ is most properly
referred to as the Son of God.

255
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,527
It's the Son of God who takes
the sins of the world upon himself

256
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,967
so that the rest of God's children,
we imperfect beings,

257
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,442
through faith, may enter
the Kingdom of heaven.

258
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,200
So God is split?
Yes.

259
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,020
And no.

260
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,660
There is unity in division.

261
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,125
And division in unity.

262
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,566
I'm not sure I follow, Padre.

263
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,802
Young man, you don't follow
for a very simple reason.

264
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,121
These men are screwballs.

265
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,282
God has children? What, and a dog?

266
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,020
A collie, maybe?

267
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,300
God doesn't have children.

268
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,129
He's a bachelor. And very angry.

269
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,300
No, no, he used to be angry.

270
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,401
What? He got over it?

271
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,925
You worship the God of another age.

272
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,241
Who has no love.

273
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,890
Not true. He likes Jews.

274
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,140
God loves everyone.

275
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,366
God is love!

276
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,180
God is who he is.

277
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,020
This is special? Who isn't who is?

278
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,090
But how should God be rendered
in a motion picture?

279
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,571
God isn't in the motion picture!

280
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,085
Then who is Todd Hocheiser?

281
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,766
Gentlemen, maybe we're biting off
more than we can chew.

282
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,161
We don't need to agree on
the nature of the deity here,

283
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,006
if we could focus on the Christ,
whatever his parentage.

284
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,403
My question is, is our depiction fair?

285
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,780
I have seen worse.

286
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,927
Reverend?

287
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,940
There is nothing to offend
a reasonable man.

288
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,060
Father.

289
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,940
The motion picture teleplay was respectful

290
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,860
and exhibited tastefulness and class.

291
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,689
Who made you an expert all of a sudden?

292
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,124
And what do you think, Rabbi?

293
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,441
Eh...

294
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,449
I haven't an opinion.

295
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,380
How did we do?
I don't...

296
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,970
Fine. What's up?

297
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,043
Can't find Baird Whitlock.

298
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,940
He left the set over an hour ago,
said he was going to his dressing room,

299
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,180
but he isn't there.

300
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,340
Out on a bender?
Middle of the day? Am I crazy?

301
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,204
You're not crazy, but, no.

302
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,700
I checked the Til Two, Dan Tana's,
Rusty Scupper. No soap.

303
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,290
Home, maybe? Called his wife?
Yep.

304
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,441
What did Laura say?

305
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,220
"He's not home, he's never home.
He's a louse. Try one of his chippies."

306
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,740
Called that script girl,
what's her name, Francie?

307
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,860
Uh, check.

308
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,980
Any of the gals missing from the set?

309
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,081
Nope.

310
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,130
All right, gone an hour?
We won't worry yet.

311
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,447
Hobie?

312
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,849
The studio says you're finished here,
and you're to report back to the lot.

313
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,007
How come?

314
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,525
They're changing your image.

315
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,727
Okay.

316
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,771
And the studio says you're escorting
Carlotta Valdez to your premiere tonight.

317
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,900
How come? I don't know her.

318
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,810
The studio's arranging it.
They're changing your image.

319
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,126
Damn it!

320
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,963
You have gas again, ma'am?

321
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,248
Ma'am? Miss. Do I look married?

322
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,528
No, miss.
No! Yeah, "Gas again."

323
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,411
Ask him. He knows.

324
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,925
All right. Scram.

325
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,205
How are you, DeeAnna?

326
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,980
How am I? Wet.

327
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,401
I don't think I'm gonna fit
in that fish-ass after this week.

328
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,580
Oh, we should have the water ballet
in the can after tomorrow.

329
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,451
In the nightclub scene, wardrobe will have
a gown for you that's more forgiving.

330
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,940
Any more thoughts about
who you might marry?

331
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,940
I ain't doing that again.
I had two marriages.

332
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,300
It just cost the studio a lot
of money to bust them up.

333
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,660
Well, we had to have those annulled.

334
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,921
One was to a minor mob figure...

335
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,809
Vince was not minor.

336
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,849
And Buddy Flynn was a bandleader
with a long history of narcotic use.

337
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,780
Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying.
They were both louses.

338
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,928
Marrying a third louse
ain't gonna do me no good.

339
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,003
We've offered you some very suitable,
clean young men.

340
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,900
Pretty boys, saps and swishes!

341
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,340
What, you think if there wasn't a good,
reliable man, I wouldn't have grabbed him?

342
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,568
What about Arne Seslum?
He is the father, isn't he?

343
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,900
Yeah, yeah.

344
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,889
The marriage doesn't have to last forever.

345
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,849
But, DeeAnna,
having a child without a father

346
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,082
would present a public-relations
problem for the studio.

347
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,322
The aquatic pictures
do very nicely for us.

348
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,531
So you go and strap on a fish-ass
and marry Arne Seslum.

349
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,780
The pictures do well for all of us,
and it's a tribute to you.

350
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,326
The public loves you because
they know how innocent you are.

351
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,100
That's true.

352
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,660
Let me see if Arne is open to matrimony.

353
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,761
You're sure he's the father?

354
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,651
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely,
he's the father, yes!

355
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,081
Pretty sure.

356
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,689
Hey, Maxie, bring me my ass back.

357
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,050
Hey, hey, buddy, come here!

358
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,446
How you doing, Hobie?

359
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,780
Hello there, Scotty.

360
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,609
They got you shooting on the lot?

361
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,166
Uh, well, Mr. Mannix
pulled me off the western.

362
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,380
Says I'm doing a movie on a sound stage.

363
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,687
They built a drawing room.

364
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,801
He's here.

365
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,246
Oh, my dear boy. Welcome.

366
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,210
Laurence Laurentz.

367
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,091
And you look wonderful, wonderful.
How do you feel?

368
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,524
Uh, well, this here
collar is a little tight.

369
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,580
No, no, no.
It's nicely fit, looks a marvel.

370
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,569
Oh.
Just takes a little getting used to.

371
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,767
Now, Hobie, here is our set.

372
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,571
And, in fact, that's right,
yes, you enter from there,

373
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,007
having just seen Biff's
valise in the foyer,

374
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,761
in spite of Allegra's claim
that he hasn't been to the house.

375
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,928
I'm sweet on Allegra.
Indeed you are.

376
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,340
But I seen Biff's grip.

377
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,680
Indeed you have.

378
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,100
And so here we find you, Hobie...

379
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,567
We find you haunted
by unspoken suspicions.

380
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,285
Haunted. By Biff's grip.

381
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,329
By his valise, yes.

382
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,700
But here is Dierdre

383
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,211
harboring deep feelings for you,
and sensing opportunity.

384
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,620
Dierdre.
Dierdre, yes.

385
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,121
So at her importuning,
you join her on the couch

386
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,362
and conversation ensues.

387
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,361
Um...

388
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,206
So, she's gonna importune, Mr. Laurence?

389
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,420
Laurentz.

390
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,780
Oh, I'm sorry.

391
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,900
She's gonna importune, Mr. Laurentz?

392
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,700
Is that something
I should be concerned about?

393
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,340
No, she'll simply ask you to join her
on the couch, is all I mean to say,

394
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,420
and then conversation ensues.

395
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,521
Okay. Okay. I gotcha.

396
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,420
Very good, very good.
Let's try one, shall we?

397
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,965
Sure. I'll give it a go.

398
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,724
Wonderful, splendid.

399
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,161
Now, the only thing I would suggest is,

400
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,340
before your first line,
you respond to her line

401
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,489
with a mirthless chuckle.

402
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,121
A mirthless chuckle.

403
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,565
Yes, I think given your unspoken
suspicions about Allegra,

404
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,540
a mirthless chuckle.

405
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,768
Uh-huh. Okay, Mr. Laurence,
I'll give it a shot.

406
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,980
Laurentz.

407
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,460
Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry, Mr. Laurentz.

408
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,686
I'll give it a shot.

409
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,969
Merrily We Dance. 27-apple, take one.

410
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,320
Action.

411
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,561
Oh, Monty.

412
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,884
Come join me on the divan.

413
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,324
It seems Allegra's a no-show,
which is simply a bore.

414
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,403
But I'll partner you in bridge.

415
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,005
Why the pout?

416
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,481
Ha!

417
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,168
Would that it were so simple.

418
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,561
Uh, cut.

419
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,924
That's a cut. Back to one.

420
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,250
Very good. Wonderful, in fact.

421
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,900
But, um, let's try it
a little differently this time.

422
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,161
Sure.
Let's try...

423
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,769
Let's see, first of all, why don't we
dispense with the mirthless chuckle?

424
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,365
No mirthless chuckle.

425
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,684
No, no need, really. It was a bad idea.
It was bad directorial.

426
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,444
My fault overthinking the thing.

427
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,766
If you say so, but I'm happy to do
another, maybe try her one more time.

428
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,366
I mean, if you want that chuckle,
I sure wanna give her to you.

429
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,460
No, no, no. Completely unnecessary
under the circumstances.

430
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,161
I think the audience can, to that extent,
they can read your thoughts,

431
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,687
and they will assume your mirthlessness.

432
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,420
Okay, you're the boss man, Mr. Laurence.

433
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,567
Laurentz.

434
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,604
Oh, gosh. I am so sorry, Mr. Laurentz.

435
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,608
Also, this time, let's try actually
looking at Dierdre as we speak.

436
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,609
Looking into her eyes and speaking
our line with a certain ruefulness.

437
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,291
Ruefulness, okay.

438
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,608
Yes. Because it's not so simple, you see.

439
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,569
Not so simple as she suggests.

440
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,881
Okay.

441
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,120
Your feelings are not so simple.

442
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,004
No, sir. Okay.

443
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,527
Roll camera.

444
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,523
Merrily We Dance. 27-apple, take two.

445
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,403
Action.

446
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,001
Oh, Monty.

447
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,521
Come join me on the divan.

448
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,404
Seems Allegra's a no-show,
which is simply a bore.

449
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,449
But I'll partner you in bridge.

450
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,011
Why the pout?

451
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,400
Would that it were so simple.

452
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,481
Cut.

453
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,924
Very good, very good.

454
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,602
Um...

455
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,721
Come, come.

456
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,640
All right.

457
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,204
All right, let's try this.

458
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,410
Your line, just say it as I say it.

459
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,602
Say your line exactly as I'm about to.

460
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,046
Just as I'm about to do.

461
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,565
Sure, okay.

462
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,130
Would that it were so simple.

463
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,841
Um...

464
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,690
Would that ih twuuuuuuh so simple.

465
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,205
Would that it were so simple.

466
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,169
Would that ih twuuuuuuh so simple.

467
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,340
My dear boy, why do you say that?

468
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,680
Why do you say "twuuuuuuh"?

469
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,083
You said, "Say it like I said it."
Yes.

470
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,208
Would that ih twuuuuuuh so simple.

471
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,420
Would that it were so simple.

472
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,284
Would that ih twuuuuuuh so simple.

473
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,124
Would that it...
Would that ih twuuuuuuh so simple?

474
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,248
No, no, watch my mouth.
Would that it were so simple.

475
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,481
Would that ih twuuuuuuh so simple.

476
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,244
Keep your head still.
Would that it were so simple.

477
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,526
Would that ih twuuuuuuh so simple.

478
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,881
Would that it were so simple.

479
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,780
I'm trying to say that, Mr. Laurentz.

480
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,927
Laurence. Mmm.

481
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,281
I thought...

482
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,724
A minute ago it was Laurentz.

483
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,484
No, we can use Christian names,
my good dear boy.

484
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,290
Laurence is fine,
just as I call you Hobie.

485
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,420
Okay.

486
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,170
So, would that it were so simple.

487
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,446
Would that ih twuuuuuuh so...

488
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,762
Keep your hand down, now!
Would that it were so simple. Trippingly.

489
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,729
Would that ih twuuuuuuh
so simple. Trippingly.

490
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,530
No, don't say "trippingly,"
say the line trippingly.

491
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,340
Would that ih twuuuuuuh...
Would that it...

492
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,420
Would that it were so simple.

493
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,500
Would that ih twuuuuuuh so simple.

494
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,580
Would that it were so simple.

495
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,660
Would that ih twuuuuuuh so simple.

496
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,740
Would that it were so simple.

497
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,860
Would that ih twuuuuuuh so simple.

498
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,927
Would that it were so simple.

499
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,940
Would that ih twuuuuuuh so simple.
Rueful, rueful, rueful.

500
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,260
Would that ih twuuuuuuh so simple.
Rueful.

501
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,521
Would that it were so simple.

502
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,880
Rueful "simple."
Would that ih twuuuuuuh...

503
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,490
Soulful "simple."
Would that ih twuuuuuuh so simple.

504
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,170
Or soulful. You could say soulful.

505
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,970
Rueful, soulful.
Would that it were so simple.

506
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,565
Would that ih twuuuuuuh so simple.

507
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,700
What are you doing this for?

508
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,801
Would that ih twuuuuuuh so...

509
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,849
Your hands! Just keep still!

510
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,420
Stall? For how long?

511
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,460
What do I tell the director?

512
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,561
That we're looking for him.

513
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,046
But we don't want it
in the gossip columns.

514
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,051
Baird on a bender, in a love nest,
or wherever we end up finding him.

515
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,646
And as far as the set is concerned,
it's business as usual.

516
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,724
Tell the ADs Baird is out briefly
with a high ankle sprain.

517
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,370
Fine, but what do we shoot without him?

518
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,164
We got the brazier
scene up this afternoon.

519
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,740
Could you get through it
shooting around him?

520
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,205
Maybe use his stunt double,
Chunk Mulligan?

521
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,326
Chunk can't act.

522
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,050
Get the writer to trim his speeches.

523
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,340
Well, maybe, but then what do we do?

524
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,900
All we got left is the final scene.

525
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,526
Autolochus' speech at the feet
of the penitent thief.

526
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,380
It's the emotional climax
of the entire picture.

527
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,962
We gotta see Autolochus has
absorbed the message of the Christ.

528
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,180
Yeah, I can see that.

529
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,020
We need Baird's star power, his charisma.

530
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,406
Sure, his emotional, uh...

531
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,403
This can't be faked!
It's the heart and soul of the picture.

532
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,528
I understand.
End of the film!

533
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,366
We can't just give the speech to some...

534
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,980
Some

535
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,445
Roman schmo!

536
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,980
No, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it.

537
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,208
But his benders can last a day or two.

538
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,525
What does it cost to shut down?

539
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,220
Plenty. You know how big this picture is?

540
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,163
We're on Stages 5 and 14.

541
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,965
If we're carrying everybody
in the final scene who's up on crucifixes

542
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,249
that's $3.40 an hour hardship pay,
eight hour minimum.

543
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,540
Yeah.
Plus we lose...

544
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,085
Mr. Mannix, I'm sorry...
Not now.

545
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,620
We lose Todd Hocheiser to Fox
at the end of the week.

546
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,700
We should have made him exclusive.

547
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,740
Who knew?

548
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,001
I'm sorry, sir.
Not now!

549
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,891
It's Mr. Laurentz. I can't stop him!

550
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,900
Mannix, I won't have it!
No! No!

551
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,300
For two decades the words
"Laurence Laurentz Presents"

552
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,481
have meant something to the public.

553
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,688
It's all right, Natalie.
Okay, Walt, let me know.

554
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,362
What's on your mind, Laurence?

555
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,488
Hobie Doyle cannot act!

556
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,005
Hobart Doyle is one of the biggest
movie stars in the world.

557
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,220
On horseback.

558
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,004
But this is a drama, Mannix, a real drama.

559
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,924
It's an adaptation of a Broadway smash!

560
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:07,209
It requires the skills of a trained
thespian, not a rodeo clown!

561
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,640
I begged you for Lunt!

562
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,660
Mr. Mannix, I'm sorry,
but you wanted me to make sure

563
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,922
you didn't miss your lunch
at the Imperial Gardens.

564
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,366
You never told me who with.

565
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,580
Nuts.

566
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,620
Look, no one wants to see Lunt.

567
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,060
We're not recasting.
This came from Mr. Schenk himself.

568
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,208
It's Hobie Doyle. Is the boy game?

569
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,601
No, he's game. And gamey!

570
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,728
Well, if he needs help,
it's your job to help him.

571
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,127
I'll have a talk with Hobie
and take a look at what you've shot,

572
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,169
but right now I've got a lunch.

573
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,004
"Truth to these mutterings, Sestimus."

574
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,480
Quiet, Engels!

575
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,900
How pleasant to see you, Mr. Mannix.

576
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,729
Your table is right over here.

577
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,291
Thank you, Arthur.

578
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,965
How you doing, Mannix?

579
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,451
Mr. Cuddahy.

580
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,331
They mix a hell of a Mai Tai.
I like this place.

581
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,643
Sorry to keep you hanging.
It's a tough decision.

582
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,407
Nothing to apologize for.
We said the deal was on the table for a week.

583
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,921
Oh.

584
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,641
Go ahead.

585
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,683
No, I'm trying to quit.

586
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,603
I just wanted to visit again to see if there
was some impediment we could help with,

587
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,260
or if something in the offer isn't clear?

588
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,408
No, the offer's very clear.
And very generous.

589
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,767
We want to make it easy
for you to say yes.

590
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,685
Mannix, we need a guy with your talents
in management, problem-solving.

591
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,888
And you need to think about the future.

592
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,769
Lockheed is booming.

593
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,123
Everyone's riding in airplanes,
and we're moving into jet airplanes.

594
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,681
It's a new age, Mannix,
and we're part of it.

595
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,810
The industry you're in,
what's the future there?

596
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,100
What happens when everybody
owns a television set?

597
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,123
Will they still be going
to pictures every week?

598
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,810
Well, we like to think that families...

599
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,140
I don't mean to denigrate.

600
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,846
I'm sure the picture business
is pretty damned interesting.

601
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,083
But it's also pretty frivolous, isn't it?

602
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,331
Aviation is serious.
Serious business, serious people.

603
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,370
You won't be babysitting
a lot of oddballs and misfits,

604
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,170
shouldering a lot of
crackpot problems for...

605
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,049
We have some kooks, sure, but...

606
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,851
Of course they're kooks!
It's all make-believe.

607
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,163
I told myself I wasn't gonna badmouth
the competition, and look at me.

608
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,800
Sorry, Mannix.
I'll stick with what we're about.

609
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,200
Let me show you something.

610
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,763
Ever heard of the Bikini Atoll?

611
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,967
No.

612
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,847
Test site.

613
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,324
Just couple of rocks in the middle
of the Pacific, until a few weeks ago,

614
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,209
when we blew the H-erino.

615
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,285
I shouldn't be telling you this.

616
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,084
It's the real world.

617
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,520
Hydrogen bomb.

618
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,891
Fusion device.

619
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,700
Armageddon.

620
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,564
And Lockheed was there. We had a...

621
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,211
Call for you, Mr. Mannix.

622
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,881
Oh, thank you.

623
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,246
Hello?

624
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,611
Yeah, he has it now?

625
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,761
No, have him stay on set, I'll go to him.

626
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,500
Sorry, Cuddahy, work emergency.

627
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,762
Still do work there, for the day anyway.

628
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,321
You make a good case. I'll let you know.

629
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,780
Uh...

630
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,405
You one of the Hollywood people?

631
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,131
Maybe.

632
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,880
They're in there.

633
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,565
Please, enter. All are welcome.

634
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,926
Those things are a nuisance.

635
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,201
Thank you.

636
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,682
We'll have sandwiches in a minute.

637
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,648
Tea?

638
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,169
Uh, okay.

639
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,209
Yeah. And, uh...

640
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,660
And what's going on?

641
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,886
Yeah.

642
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,724
Well, we've just read the minutes.

643
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,882
And Alan was about to
bring up new business.

644
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,722
Well, I missed the minutes.

645
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,406
I wouldn't worry about it.

646
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,642
They're usually pretty boring.

647
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,689
What kind of a meeting is this?

648
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,330
Well, it's not a meeting

649
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,005
so much as a...

650
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,924
It's, uh, more of a study group.

651
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,525
And you're studying?

652
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,411
All sorts of jolly stuff.

653
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,164
History.
Economics.

654
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,765
Same thing, isn't it?

655
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,161
History, economics.

656
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,765
Don't you agree?

657
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,209
I'm not really a student of history.

658
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,721
Quiet, Engels!

659
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,521
Thank you.

660
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,769
Man is split?

661
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,445
Well, Man's functions are split.

662
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,140
There's the little guy,
the regular Joe who works for a living.

663
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,561
He's the body, body politic.

664
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,087
Then there's the brain,
the boss, the owner.

665
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,571
The boss is not the brain.

666
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,245
No, no! The boss is parasite!

667
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,127
Well, it's true that the boss doesn't work,
but he has a function.

668
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,611
He controls the means of...

669
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,610
Production.
Sure, but that's not a function, that's...

670
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,808
Parasitism! On the...
Shut up!

671
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,804
On the body politic. Of the regular Joe!
Shut up!

672
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,324
Man is unitary.

673
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,881
A simple economic agent.

674
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,486
Man's institutions are split,

675
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,167
expressing contradictions
that must be worked through.

676
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:03,249
And they are worked through
in a causative, predictable way.

677
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,163
History is science.

678
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,644
This is the essence of the dialectic.

679
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,289
You see, if you understand economics,

680
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,245
you can actually write down
what will happen in the future.

681
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,220
With as much confidence as you
write down the history of the past.

682
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,767
Because it's science.
It's not make believe.

683
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,843
We don't believe in Santa Claus.

684
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,605
Another finger sandwich?

685
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,491
Thank you. Now if I follow this correctly...

686
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,681
Who's that guy?

687
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,126
Uh, Mr. Smitrovich takes
pictures for our newsletter.

688
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,329
Our understanding
of the true workings of history

689
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,220
gives us access to the levers of power.

690
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,962
Your studio, for instance,
is a pure instrument of capitalism.

691
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:53,887
As such, it expresses
the contradictions of capitalism

692
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:59,729
and can be enlisted to
finance its own destruction.

693
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,440
Which is exciting.

694
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,883
It can be made to help the little guy,
the regular Joe.

695
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,565
The body politic!
Shut up!

696
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,200
Even though its purpose
is to exploit the little guy.

697
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,731
And the body politic.

698
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,961
You're for the little guy?

699
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,300
For the little guy or against,
it doesn't matter.

700
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,047
History will be what it will be,
and we already know what it'll be.

701
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,685
But yes, we're for the little guy.

702
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,569
Aren't you?
Shut up!

703
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,180
Are you joking? Me, for the little guy?

704
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,520
Of course I'm for the little guy.

705
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,250
What, is this guy a comedian?

706
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,380
Listen, I better get back.
The studio's gotta be going nuts.

707
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,447
Can we cut it off now and pick it up
right here at the next study session?

708
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,082
Okay, well, see...

709
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,688
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

710
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:56,447
And so, Baird Whitlock found himself
in the hands of communists.

711
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,446
Meanwhile, far from
the crashing surf of Malibu,

712
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,605
Eddie Mannix,
torn from his lunch with a Lockheed man,

713
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,843
hurries back to the vastness
of Capitol Pictures,

714
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,611
whose tireless machinery clanks on,

715
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,366
producing this year's ration of dreams

716
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,131
for all the weary peoples of the world.

717
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,090
Hey, numbskull. Didn't you
see the rolling light was on?

718
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,811
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Mannix.
Can I help you find someone?

719
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,100
No.

720
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,804
Autolochus!
Yes?

721
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,928
Why do you present yourself
in my chambers in such humble fashion?

722
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,287
Do not look upon me, Ursulina.

723
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,488
The fires of the brazier of Sestimus
have latterly burned my face!

724
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,162
Though the unguents of Arkimideus
promise shortly to undo the damage.

725
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,561
Autolochus, you know that my love
is for you, not for your station.

726
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,140
And my ardor for you...

727
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,129
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

728
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,490
"We are the Future."

729
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,561
What does that mean?

730
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,921
Beats me.

731
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,684
Somebody slipped it under my door
sometime after we broke this morning.

732
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,060
Mention it to anyone?

733
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,220
Nope.

734
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,163
Okay, well, let's keep it that way.

735
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,763
Hey, by the way,
Chunk sounded good in there.

736
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,526
Natalie, could you please
get me Stu Schwartz, Accounting?

737
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,842
Stu Schwartz on two.

738
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,650
Stu, how are ya? I need some petty cash.

739
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,211
$100,000.

740
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,850
I'm sorry, did I say petty?

741
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,849
Well, it's a long story,
and I'll tell it to you some time.

742
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,690
You have that much in the office?

743
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,962
Yeah, how much space will that take up?

744
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,220
Uh, Mr. Mannix?

745
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,526
All right, this might do it.

746
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,044
Uh, Thora Thacker just came in.

747
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,531
Wonders if you have a moment.

748
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,620
Thora Thacker.

749
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,210
Tell her I'm stuck on a call.

750
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,010
I'll leave through the patio.

751
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,060
Call didn't take so long then.

752
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,162
Yes. No. Fast talkers.

753
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,566
What can I do for you, Thora?

754
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,940
Well, I'll be fast, too.

755
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:02,241
I only wanted to notify you as a courtesy
that I am running my Baird Whitlock story.

756
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,620
Yeah? What's the story?

757
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:07,088
The story. I have a credible source
and I am going to run it,

758
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,810
and I think you know what story I mean.

759
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,100
I have no idea.

760
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,100
There's nothing going on with Baird.
I would know, wouldn't I?

761
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,420
Don't play dumb, Eddie.

762
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,806
I am talking about

763
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,081
On Wings as Eagles.

764
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,100
What?

765
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,361
Running it tomorrow.

766
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,400
First of all...

767
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,580
First of all, there's
nothing to that story.

768
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,220
I've heard it, it's been around forever,
and it's never been confirmed.

769
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,765
And secondly, you can't print that.

770
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,365
Even if you could print it,
you couldn't print it.

771
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,005
And you wouldn't want to, Thora.
It's beneath you.

772
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,525
The facts are never beneath me.

773
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,921
People don't want the facts,
they wanna believe!

774
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,660
That's our great industry,
mine and yours, too.

775
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,769
They wanna believe that Baird Whitlock
is a great star and a good man.

776
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,001
You're admitting he isn't.

777
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,202
No, I'm saying he is,
though it's beside the point.

778
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,249
There's nothing to it,
nothing to the gossip.

779
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,528
I am not a gossip columnist!

780
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,806
No, no, no, of course not.

781
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,729
Don't confuse me with my sister!

782
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,287
Hardly.
But look, do you have to run it tomorrow?

783
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,980
It's my entire column.

784
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:03,130
I'm happy to talk to Baird for comment,
but it will have to be this afternoon.

785
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,780
Baird's unavailable
right now. Wait one day.

786
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,860
Ha!

787
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,260
Thora, wait one day and I'll give you
a true story for tomorrow's column.

788
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,811
A little something about Hobie Doyle.

789
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,325
My readers don't care about Hobie Doyle.

790
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,487
He wears chaps!

791
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,780
Do they care about Carlotta Valdez?

792
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,881
They're sweet on each other.

793
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,407
You should see the two of them together.
Like peas in a pod.

794
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,020
Trade the story of my career
for a puff piece on Hobie Doyle?

795
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,540
I don't think so.

796
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,580
You're not trading anything, you're waiting
one day on a story that's years old.

797
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,580
Wait one day. I can let you talk to Baird,
show you your story's the bunk.

798
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,140
If I'm wrong, no skin off your nose.
You run the column.

799
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,765
In the meantime, you have an exclusive.

800
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,962
No one else knows
about Hobie and Carlotta.

801
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,849
No kidding. You're it.

802
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,220
What kind of name is Thora, anyway?

803
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,766
It's a name that 19 million readers trust.

804
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,490
Don't play games with them, Eddie.

805
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,569
Oh, nobody's playing games here.

806
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,845
Is that big enough?

807
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,322
Hello, Eddie.
I'm notifying you as a courtesy

808
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,249
before I run tomorrow's story.

809
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,522
Thessaly? Yeah, I just saw your...

810
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,682
Ah, never mind. How you doing?
What's the story?

811
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,180
It's about Baird Whitlock.

812
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,487
There's absolutely no truth
to that old story, believe me.

813
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,820
Old?
Old, stale, rotten and...

814
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,820
I'm talking about today.

815
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,220
What?

816
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,940
A little bird told me that he disappeared
from the set today.

817
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,610
Oh, that! No, no.

818
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,260
Yes, he did have to take a break.

819
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,850
Minor injury. High ankle sprain.

820
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,060
What did you think I meant?

821
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,889
No, nothing. I saw your sister earlier.

822
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,883
She was trying to resurrect
some old gossip about Baird.

823
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,100
Oh, I'm sure she was, that cow!

824
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,487
She wouldn't know a news story
if it bit her on the posterior.

825
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,180
Yeah, well, she's...
High ankle sprain?

826
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,089
Is that really the best
you could come up with?

827
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,965
We all know about the womanizing
and the drinking jags

828
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,460
and those trips to San Berdoo.

829
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,641
Baird is a good family man.

830
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,882
He has a high ankle sprain.

831
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,326
Mr. Mannix?

832
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,540
What's up, Peanut?

833
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,722
Natalie told me to find you PDQ.

834
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,565
I know it sounds screwy, but she said
someone's calling from the future.

835
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,620
Good Lord! Thessaly, I have to run.

836
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,246
If you do know where Baird is,
you must let me talk to him.

837
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,526
Sure. I'll find out where he is
right away, Thessaly, and I'm sure...

838
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,409
Say, what kind of
name is Thessaly, anyway?

839
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,562
It's a name that 20 million readers trust.

840
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,245
They want the truth, Eddie.

841
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,528
The truth, yes. Mmm-hmm.

842
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,288
We're gonna give it to them.

843
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,161
On three. And Hobie Doyle is in there.

844
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,004
Hey.
Hello, Mr. Mannix.

845
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,401
Thanks for coming, Hobie. One second.

846
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,081
Hello, Mannix...

847
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,085
Damn.

848
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,084
Hung up, Natalie.
Tell me the second they call back.

849
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,601
Yes, sir.

850
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,980
What's going on there, Mr. Mannix?

851
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,003
Looks like you're expecting rain.

852
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,770
No, it's nothing.

853
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,420
How's the first day on the picture?

854
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,124
You getting comfortable?

855
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,091
Oh, I guess it's going pretty good.

856
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,180
Uh, that Mr. Laurentz,
he's an awful good man.

857
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,691
He's helping me get through it.

858
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:44,528
I give him all the credit in the world,
me being the new hand in the bunkhouse.

859
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:47,806
They got me talking a lot,
which takes a little getting used to,

860
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,442
talking with the camera looking
at me, but, heck, I enjoy.

861
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,700
Oh, good, that's fine.

862
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,929
Usually on a picture, I just say,
"Whitey" or "Whoa, there."

863
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,260
But this one here, it's talking.

864
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,805
And it's people listening.

865
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,768
That threw me a little at first,
but I think I got my leg up on her now.

866
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,641
That's fine. Laurentz came by this morning
to tell me how well you're doing.

867
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,940
You just continue to do whatever he says.

868
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,610
He knows how to make a quality picture.

869
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,740
That is true. He will not quit
on a take until it has quality.

870
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,860
That them?

871
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,300
Sorry, sir, no.

872
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,562
Do you want Mrs. Mannix on one?

873
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,641
Hiya, hon.

874
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,130
You know, busy.

875
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,441
Uh-huh.

876
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,521
Uh-huh.

877
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,447
I thought he asked to play infield.

878
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,966
I see.

879
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,009
Maybe we should make him
honor that commitment.

880
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,091
That's true. No, of course, you're right.

881
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,481
Okay. Okay, I'll call the coach.

882
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,846
Sure.

883
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,200
I love you, too.

884
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,527
Mr. Mannix, you want me to run out
and get you a bigger grip?

885
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,489
That one looks a little bit snug.

886
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,131
Hobie.

887
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,805
There's $100,000 in that attaché case.

888
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,891
Ransom money.

889
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,007
Baird Whitlock has been kidnapped.

890
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,565
This is bad.

891
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,128
Bad for movie stars everywhere.

892
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,086
And you got no idea
who's mixed up in this thing?

893
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,489
I would look at the extras.

894
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,927
The extras? Why?

895
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,924
Well, you just never know about an extra.
They come and go.

896
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,940
Everyone else, I'm on the set,
I see the guy setting the 5K,

897
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,566
I think, "Why, there's
old Bud setting the 5K."

898
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,041
Script girl, wrangler, same thing.

899
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,725
Extras, that's different.

900
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,820
Not making a blanket call here.

901
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,820
I mean, there's good
extras and bad extras.

902
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,763
All I'm saying

903
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,500
you look at an extra,

904
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,921
you got no idea what he's thinking.

905
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,449
He's back! Line two.

906
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,645
Hello.
You have the money?

907
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,285
Yes, I have it.

908
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,726
Stage 8?

909
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,366
Behind the electrical box?
Just leave it there?

910
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,500
And when do I get Baird?
When we have the money.

911
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,125
I'll do it right now.

912
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,646
Can I use your belt?

913
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,180
The Swingin' Dinghy is closing, folks.

914
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,727
Time for me to clean up,
time for you to clear out.

915
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,326
So long, fellas. See ya in eight months.

916
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,780
Toodle-oo.
See ya later, boys.

917
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,041
Eight months?

918
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,810
Yeah, we're shipping out in the morning.

919
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,884
Golly! Eight months without a dame.

920
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,481
Can you beat it?

921
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,165

967
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,820
This place looks open!

968
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,247
What the...

969
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,371
You, out!

970
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,161
Stop it! Hey!
Hey!

971
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,526
Quit it!
Cut that out!

972
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,920
This ain't that kind of a place!

973
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,607
Cut!

974
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,460
Yeah, okay.
Okay, kids...

975
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,561
Okay.

976
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,451
Come here, Burt Gurney. We go again.

977
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,005
Anything different, Mr. Seslum?

978
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no.

979
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:21,285
Mostly pretty good, but this time
don't put dishrag on bartender's head.

980
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,289
You're a big star, Burt Gurney.

981
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,164
Who cares about the bartender?

982
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,660
You are the star.

983
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,205
That's my whole character, the slow burn.

984
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,700
Gosh, Mr. Seslum,
I don't mind if he wants to...

985
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,086
It is decided.
Hello, Burt.

986
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:32,846
Hello, Mr. Mannix.

987
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,368
Arne.
Hello.

988
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:39,220
Listen, I don't wanna stick my nose
in other people's business, but, uh...

989
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:43,100
Well, I understand you've been
associating with DeeAnna Moran?

990
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,180
Yeah, yeah, we associated.

991
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,260
Yes.

992
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,091
But no more, no more.
Don't you worry, Eddie Mannix.

993
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,084
But, Arne, you are aware that she's...

994
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,164
This must not be in movie magazines,
that we are associated.

995
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,380
No, no, of course not.

996
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,845
My wife cannot read this.

997
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,121
Your... Excuse me?

998
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,890
Ilsa Pflug.

999
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,247
Ilsa Pflug-Seslum.

1000
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,460
In Malmö.

1001
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:06,766
I was not aware of that.

1002
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,690
Yeah, two children.

1003
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,730
And a third on the way, apparently.
Mmm-hmm.

1004
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,840
Do you enjoy physical culture,
Eddie Mannix? Do you ski?

1005
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,340
No. I never took it up.
Seems like a lot of fun, Arne.

1006
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,420
I no more associate with DeeAnna Moran.

1007
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,601
I hug you.

1008
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,050
Goodbye.

1009
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,220
I spent the night.

1010
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,980
So, I feel somebody poking at me,
and I wake up and it's Clark.

1011
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,527
And he says, "Well, your keys aren't
in there, so I guess we're walking."

1012
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,740
This was back before Gable was Gable.

1013
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:43,220
Yeah, we used to go up
to San Berdoo every weekend.

1014
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,260
Bob Stack would come up sometimes.

1015
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,283
Blue Grotto was still open.

1016
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,881
Dave Chasen was a busboy.

1017
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,728
Quite a place. Yours?

1018
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,321
Gracious, no. It belongs to
a member of our study group.

1019
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,404
He couldn't be here this afternoon.

1020
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,780
He'll be sad to have missed you.

1021
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,927
He's a fan.

1022
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,326
Uh-huh. That's swell.

1023
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,244
So, I black out, I wake up here...

1024
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,403
And I say to myself,

1025
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,847
"Baird, you gotta stop doing this."

1026
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,570
But you're saying, actually,
technically, I was kidnapped.

1027
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,048
Well, technically, yes.

1028
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,561
There's gonna be a ransom?

1029
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,140
I'd hardly call it a ransom.

1030
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,900
Benedict there.
That's Benedict de Bonaventure.

1031
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,809
He wrote The House of Ahasuaris.

1032
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:28,660
Enormous hit. Made the
studio millions of dollars.

1033
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,980
Did you see any of those
millions of dollars, Ben?

1034
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,161
I did not.

1035
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,566
Dutch over there.

1036
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,685
Dutch Zweistrong wrote
All The Way To Uruguay.

1037
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,922
I wrote all the All The Way pictures.

1038
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:42,004
All successful.
You see any of the profits, Dutch?

1039
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,602
See, all of us here are writers.

1040
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,444
The pictures originated with us.
They're our ideas.

1041
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,090
But they're owned by the studio.

1042
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,860
I'm not saying only writers
are being exploited.

1043
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,121
I mean, look at yourself, Baird.

1044
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,442
The studio takes pretty good care of me.

1045
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,880
What are you, a child?

1046
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,201
I think what Herschel's trying to say is,

1047
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,330
just because the studio owns
the means of production,

1048
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:13,140
why should it be able to
take the money, our money,

1049
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:17,540
the value created by our labor,
and dole out what it pleases?

1050
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,801
That's not right.

1051
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,169
So, no. No. I wouldn't call it ransom.

1052
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,890
Payback.
That's right.

1053
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:28,563
Now, until quite recently our
study group had a narrow focus.

1054
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,406
We concentrated on getting communist
content into motion pictures.

1055
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,688
Always in a sub rosa way, of course.

1056
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,247
And we were pretty darn successful.

1057
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,740
You remember in Kerner's Corner
the town hall scene where the alderman

1058
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,929
overturned the rotten election
and made Gus the mayor?

1059
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:45,841
Yeah.

1060
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:50,526
Well, I like to think
we've changed a few minds.

1061
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,048
But then Dr. Marcuse came down from
Stanford, joined the study group

1062
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:59,171
and started teaching
us about direct action.

1063
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,900
Praxis.
Action.

1064
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,562
We each pursue our own economic interest.

1065
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,329
We ourselves are not above
the laws of history.

1066
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:14,050
But in pursuing our interests with vigor,

1067
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,420
we accelerate the dialectic

1068
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:22,048
and hasten the end of history
and the creation of the New Man.

1069
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,402
Plus, we make a little dough.
Shut up!

1070
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,380
We're not even talking about money!

1071
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,209
We're talking about economics.

1072
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,484
Sure, good.

1073
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,090
Good stuff.

1074
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,844
So, now, uh, do I get
a share of the ransom?

1075
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,100
No.

1076
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:42,620
No, Mr. Whitlock, you can
hardly share in your own ransom.

1077
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,140
That would be unethical.

1078
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,242
I don't know.
That doesn't seem fair, fellas.

1079
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,645
I mean, the whole setup only works
if I play along, right?

1080
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,731
If I don't let on that I know
who kidnapped me.

1081
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,211
Well, yes, that's right.

1082
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,251
What if I name names?

1083
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,083
If I just tell the truth.

1084
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:03,921
Uh...

1085
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,404
I don't think you'll
do that, Mr. Whitlock.

1086
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:14,450
What if we told the truth
about On Wings as Eagles?

1087
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,565
Sid.

1088
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,803
We have to work something
out for DeeAnna Moran.

1089
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:26,420
She get married again?

1090
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:29,000
No, that's the problem.
Having a child, not married.

1091
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,180
Whew. Tough.

1092
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,340
Yeah, no father.

1093
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,680
Well, of course there is one somewhere.

1094
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,540
But who knows?
Exactly.

1095
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:35,766
So is there any way...

1096
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,451
I'm just spitballing here.

1097
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,730
Any way she could adopt her own child?

1098
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:45,609
Interesting. As a single...
Mmm-hmm.

1099
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,122
She disappears for a while, reappears.
Uh-huh.

1100
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,328
She wants to share her
blessings, adopt a child.

1101
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,324
Sure. She's always yearned to be a mother.

1102
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:54,881
That's it.

1103
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,540
Well, I don't see why not.

1104
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,580
Nothing in the California statute

1105
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,648
prohibits adoption by one's own parent.
Mmm-hmm.

1106
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:01,700
This is new ground.

1107
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:05,020
Technically, she'd have to give up
the baby to a third party.

1108
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,326
Joe Silverman.

1109
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:09,046
Joe Silverman. Exactly.

1110
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,780
He's the foster father for a few days.

1111
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,565
She hands the kid to Joe,
he hands it back.

1112
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,020
I'll do some research.

1113
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:17,121
All right.

1114
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:19,169
Mr. Mannix, it's 5:30.

1115
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,526
This is exciting.

1116
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:23,580
...and asked all of the assistant directors,
and one of them said

1117
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:27,180
that an extra in the courtyard
of Sestimus Amydias seemed jumpy.

1118
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,140
All right. Get Walt the name of the extra
so he can bring him in and sweat him.

1119
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,620
Walt should tell him that we won't press charges
if he tells us where Baird's been taken.

1120
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:33,740
Check.

1121
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:37,140
And if he plays dumb, or the AD's wrong
and he is dumb, check the other extras.

1122
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:41,162
Check. Thessaly Thacker called, said you
promised her an interview with Baird today.

1123
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,060
Check that. It was Thora Thacker.

1124
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,300
No, it's Thessaly.

1125
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,900
Tell her he was at the doctor
longer than expected,

1126
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,780
and she can see him
on the set bright and early tomorrow.

1127
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:50,008
Check. And is that last part true?

1128
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,580
Let's hope so. Oh, that reminds me.

1129
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,011
I need a list of everyone who worked on

1130
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:54,929
On Wings as Eagles
who's still at the studio.

1131
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,020
On Wings as Eagles?
That's a while ago now.

1132
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,180
Aside from Baird and the director,
it won't be a long list.

1133
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,770
Yeah. Get it for me. That it?

1134
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,769
Uh, no. One more thing.

1135
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,100
A Mr. Cuddahy called,

1136
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,780
said you know him.
Yeah, yeah.

1137
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:08,100
He said it's urgent,
he'll see you one last time,

1138
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,420
suggested same place, 7:00 this evening.

1139
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,260
Why? Never mind.

1140
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,727
Okay, tell him I'll be there.

1141
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:15,980
Back to your place?

1142
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,140
What a bore.

1143
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,260
Hello, C.C.

1144
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,691
I rather thought we might go to Lake...

1145
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:21,921
Oh, hi, Eddie.

1146
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,043
Wanna lace up what you got
on Merrily We Dance?

1147
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,441
It's up now. I'll put some music on it.

1148
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,126
Taxi!

1149
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:19,180
Back to your place?

1150
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,500
What a bore.

1151
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,683
I rather thought we might go to
Lake Onondaga for the weekend.

1152
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,166
Just the two of us.

1153
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,607
Don't have my valise.
I left it in your foyer.

1154
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,740
Oh, you'll get by without a change.

1155
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:30,940
Suits me.

1156
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,860
If you don't mind skipping
out on your own party, Allegra.

1157
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:33,900
Suits me.

1158
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,420
And skipping out on Monty.

1159
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,340
That suits me as well.

1160
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,408
Oh, poor Monty.

1161
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:40,860
What Monty doesn't know...

1162
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,121
Won't hurt Monty.

1163
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:57,887
Oh, Monty.

1164
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,164
Come join me on the divan.

1165
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:13,488
It seems Allegra's a no-show,
which is simply a bore.

1166
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:14,681
But I'll...

1167
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,161
Reverse.

1168
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,410
Reverse! Reverse!

1169
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,481
Whoa!

1170
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,964
Whoa!

1171
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,884
I shouldn't wear scarves.

1172
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:56,888
It seems Allegra's a no-show,
which is simply a bore.

1173
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,043
But I'll partner you in bridge.

1174
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:00,965
Why the pout?

1175
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,724
It's complicated.

1176
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,848
How pleasant to see you again, Mr. Mannix.

1177
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:16,820
Thanks for coming back, Mannix.

1178
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,220
Sure.

1179
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,685
You're taking us down
to the wire, aren't ya?

1180
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,620
It's not a ploy, it's a big decision.

1181
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:25,060
Absolutely. No foul.

1182
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,810
But the board was concerned when I
couldn't give them a yes this afternoon,

1183
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,729
so they authorized me to say this.

1184
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:34,242
You sign on, your term
of contract is 10 years.

1185
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:38,140
Yeah. You get it, right?

1186
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,660
That means your stock options
are guaranteed to vest.

1187
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:44,048
You'd never have to work again
if you chose to retire after your term.

1188
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,404
Think about it.

1189
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,500
Lifetime employment.

1190
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,660
You wouldn't be a glorified
working stiff like you are now,

1191
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,444
and you'd be running a business,
not a circus.

1192
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,281
Drink?

1193
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:58,921
Cigarette?

1194
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,369
No, no. I gotta run.

1195
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,260
I should talk this over with my wife.

1196
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,283
Of course. Talk it over,
think about your family,

1197
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:10,940
let us know in the morning.

1198
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,540
Oh!

1199
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,531
If you think this is a bribe,
you're absolutely right.

1200
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:16,820
You have two kids, right?
A boy and a girl?

1201
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,001
That's right.

1202
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:21,682
They love this stuff. Used to be trains.

1203
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:24,407
Hello, Hobie.

1204
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,020
Oh, hello, Carlotta.

1205
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,121
Am I late?

1206
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:29,700
Oh, no, it ain't nothin'.

1207
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:32,100
Thanks an awful bunch for coming
to this picture with me.

1208
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:35,940
I don't know if you like livestock,
but I think it's got moments, I really do.

1209
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:37,140
You look very purty.

1210
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,340
Thank you, Hobie!

1211
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:39,460
I'm sure I'll like the picture.

1212
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:40,940
I like all of your pictures.

1213
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,020
Well, I like yours, too.

1214
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,060
They are just the craziest things.

1215
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,700
Uh, is it hard to dance
with all them bananas on your head?

1216
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,802
Oh, no. Anyone can do it.

1217
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:54,246
It's all in the hips and the lips
and the eyes and the thighs.

1218
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:26,260
Little Eddie wanted me to
tell you about his baseball game.

1219
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:28,300
They won.

1220
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,970
That is terrific.

1221
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,140
Gosh, I never called the coach.

1222
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:33,321
Eddie played at shortstop?

1223
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:36,609
Mmm. And he did so well,
he wants to stay there now.

1224
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,450
That's great.

1225
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,006
Took care of itself.

1226
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:43,220
And Darlene did very well
on her Spanish test.

1227
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:46,005
That's good. She was worried about that.

1228
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,660
Hey, thanks for heating up the roast, hon.

1229
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:49,820
Warm glass of milk?

1230
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,445
Uh, no, thanks, hon. Coffee.

1231
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,500
I gotta run back to the studio.

1232
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,681
A few things to take care of.

1233
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,171
Gee, another late night.
Hmm.

1234
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:03,010
You know, Lockheed improved their offer.

1235
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:06,967
Darned good money, and the hours
wouldn't be crazy like this either.

1236
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,884
It's nice to be wanted.

1237
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,961
Yeah. Sure, but...

1238
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,563
What do you think?
They wanna know tomorrow.

1239
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,289
I like the shorter hours.

1240
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:22,008
But what do you think, honey? You know best.

1241
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:23,801
Hmm.

1242
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,484
How's it going with the smoking, dear?

1243
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:30,605
Oh, you know...

1244
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:40,250
The denizens of Los Angeles make
ready for nightlife, or for sleep.

1245
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:43,085
But Eddie Mannix will have neither.

1246
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:49,087
Even in westerly Malibu,
the sun has moved on,

1247
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:50,900
leaving the vast and tireless sea

1248
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,527
to heave itself blindly upon the shore.

1249
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:00,900
The communists welcome
a rare moment of leisure.

1250
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,367
Brief surcease from struggle.

1251
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,460
Baird Whitlock has become their acolyte,

1252
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:15,205
a convert to their cause,
his belief compelled but not grudging.

1253
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:20,100
He now seeks to learn more
from Professor Marcuse

1254
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:24,600
and becomes ever more committed
to the quest to hasten an end to history

1255
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,529
and bring on the New Man.

1256
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:29,420
Herb, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

1257
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,522
That's what happened to me
when I went to Reno with Danny Kaye,

1258
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,260
and he asked me to shave his back.

1259
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,620
The exact same thing.

1260
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,370
Because I'm thinking, "Who benefits?"

1261
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:39,900
Also, I gotta tell ya,
everybody thinks that Danny is a jerk.

1262
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,490
He's not really a jerk.

1263
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:44,849
It's just the theory
generating its own anti-theory.

1264
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,804
Anyway, there we were, it's me and Danny,

1265
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,566
and I'm wondering what the hell
am I doing with a razor in my hand.

1266
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,001
And he says it's for
a Norman Taurog picture.

1267
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:54,420
But Judy Canova is there,
and she knows Norman.

1268
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,568
She says, "Danny's not doing
a Norman Taurog picture.

1269
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,848
"He just wants you to shave his back!"

1270
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,651
And that's who benefits.

1271
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:09,820
In livelier precincts, the swells
of Dreamland gather to inspect

1272
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,940
the completed weave
of another piece of gossamer.

1273
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:17,300
Another movie, another portion of balm

1274
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:20,927
for the ache of a toiling mankind.

1275
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,500
Where is she?

1276
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,060
Hold your horses, I'm right here.

1277
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:30,500
What's on your mind, Curly?

1278
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,660
It's not my fault you saw me take

1279
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:35,180
that pie off the sill, Ms. McGraw.

1280
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:38,260
Not your fault? Whose fault was it, Curly?

1281
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:42,684
Why, that crazy, lazy full moon!

1282
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,846
Two weeks ago, you'd
never seen me take it.

1283
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,410
Darn you, moon! What good are you anyway?

1284
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:54,060
Don't know about this part.

1285
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:56,700
They only give me one shot at the song.

1286
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,723
I wish there never was no moon.

1287
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:01,805
I wish there weren't no bossy old women!

1288
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:06,020
Don't blame that moon, Curly.
She can't do nothin' but shine.

1289
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:10,808
Lazy ol' moon, keep shinin'

1290
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:12,605
Darn you.

1291
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,380
Shinin' down on me

1292
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:18,804
You turned Curly Strimlin in to
the authorities for the last time!

1293
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,168
Lazy ol' moon, keep shinin'

1294
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:30,648
Shinin' just to be

1295
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:39,771
On that ol' plantation
where I used to roam

1296
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:43,606
Light my weary way back home

1297
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,242
Darn! Where'd she go?

1298
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,966
Lazy ol' moon, keep shinin'

1299
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:56,488
Shinin' down for me

1300
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:16,321
Another part of town,
another cast of characters,

1301
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:21,284
another task for Eddie Mannix.

1302
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,620
We're just getting started.

1303
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:39,780
I've been taking DeeAnna through this.

1304
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,780
So Joe has done

1305
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:44,580
just a whole lot of good work
for us in the past.

1306
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,887
Whenever we've needed a witness
or a third party for...

1307
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:51,202
I don't know, a petition of grievance
or alienation of affection.

1308
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:52,820
And he's reliable?

1309
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,180
I'm bonded, miss.

1310
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:58,242
Joseph Silverman is the most reliable human
being on the planet in our experience.

1311
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:02,169
When Chubby Cregar was intoxicated
and hit that pedestrian on Gower,

1312
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:04,444
we had the vehicle title
transferred to Joe's name,

1313
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,806
and Joe did six months
in LA County lockup.

1314
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:10,171
But you're off the sauce now?

1315
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:12,602
I never touch it. It was a legal fiction.

1316
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:13,900
That's right.

1317
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,820
When the studio needs someone
who meets the legal standard of, uh...

1318
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,081
How did you put it, Sid?

1319
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:19,980
Personhood.

1320
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:23,801
Joe steps in and acts as the person.

1321
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,885
So you're a professional person?

1322
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,924
That's right, miss. Initial here and here.

1323
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:34,606
Joe will be the foster parent
until such time as you adopt the child,

1324
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,963
which you can do as soon
as Joe takes possession of it.

1325
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,286
And he's reliable?

1326
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,640
I'm bonded, miss.

1327
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:45,204
The release papers you're signing
will not be a matter of public record.

1328
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:49,126
All these documents
will be sealed until the year 2015.

1329
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:51,651
And no one's the wiser.

1330
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,046
No one the wiser.

1331
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:57,131
No fans, no press, no court officials,
not even a notary public.

1332
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,323
Joe himself is the notary.

1333
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,369
You must have very strong forearms.

1334
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,088
Is it hard squeezing it like that?

1335
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,004
It's part of the job, miss.

1336
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,380
Late night, Mr. Mannix?

1337
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:23,900
Late night for both of us.

1338
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,220
Will you call Projection Seven
and have them

1339
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,540
lace up yesterday's
dailies on Hail, Caesar!

1340
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:29,404
Sure thing. Yesterday's?

1341
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,760
Thanks, Scotty.

1342
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:40,364
Romans before slaves!
Make room, you fools!

1343
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,442
Romans before slaves!

1344
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:47,525
Romans before slaves!

1345
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,246
Make room!

1346
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:05,980
How's that? What do you think?
Cut!

1347
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,180
27, Baker two.

1348
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,300
Action.

1349
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,970
Go ahead, I'm listening.

1350
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:12,447
Walt talked to the extra. Right guy.

1351
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:14,620
No info. Doesn't know
where they took Baird,

1352
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:17,500
but described the truck they put him in.

1353
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,726
Cut! Good!

1354
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:21,691
Walt found the guy who owns
the truck and is talking to him.

1355
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:22,980
Baker four.

1356
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:25,048
Walt's a problem-solver. He's a good man.
Action!

1357
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:26,780
What else?

1358
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:29,565
PR just called in their report
on the Hobie Doyle premiere.

1359
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,060
Warm reception.

1360
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:32,400
I got something... I had spittle.
Good.

1361
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,540
Baker six.
Action.

1362
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,244
Okay. He's terrific.

1363
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,361
Squint! Squint against the grandeur.

1364
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:40,561
It's blinding! Blinding!

1365
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:52,561
Now, let's see what we can do here.

1366
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:55,325
Okay.

1367
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:59,525
Well, I don't think it's regulation size,
but it'll have to do.

1368
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:02,450
You ever heard of origami,
what the Japanese do?

1369
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,531
This here's Italian origami.

1370
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,140
Yeah?

1371
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:07,924
See, now you just... Whoop!

1372
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:10,603
Let's see how she does now.

1373
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:14,285
Oh, she's peekin' back.

1374
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,845
Oh! There she goes.

1375
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,361
She's bawlin'.

1376
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,161
Clear!
Ah!

1377
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:24,804
This is why I never
order it with meat sauce.

1378
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,530
How'd you get into pictures, Hobie?

1379
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:28,006
Got roped into it.

1380
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:31,881
Stop!

1381
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,441
Don't play with your food.

1382
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:40,847
Food!

1383
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:42,380
You're the one playing with it.

1384
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,720
Stop it!

1385
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,940
Pictures. Well, I wrangled for a while,

1386
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:48,168
and then they saw I
could say a line or two,

1387
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:52,648
and I was Bad Clem or Deputy Number Two
or a guy's buddy for a couple of years,

1388
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:56,247
and then someone heard me sing
and they made me the guy.

1389
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,686
You're awfully cute.

1390
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,650
Oh, heck, you ain't seen the half of it.
I'll show you cute.

1391
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:04,322
Just a second here,
a little souvenir from my rodeo days.

1392
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:13,380
Tell you what, I was steer-bustin',
and I went down and the steer went up,

1393
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:16,051
and my teeth headed off for east Texas.

1394
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:18,004
Here, it's coming around again.

1395
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:19,801
Whoo!

1396
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,340
You gotta give a little

1397
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:25,680
Take a little

1398
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,685
And let your poor heart break a little

1399
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,171
That's the story of...

1400
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,486
That's the glory of love

1401
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:38,247
You gotta laugh a little, cry a little

1402
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,129
And let the clouds roll by a...

1403
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:42,500
Well, now, this is interesting.

1404
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,250
I didn't know you two were friends.

1405
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,611
Oh, heck, yeah.

1406
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,929
We just caught my picture Lazy
Ol' Moon, and I guess we're...

1407
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,088
Yes, we're friends. We're...

1408
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:54,924
We're fixin' to be friendly,
tell you that.

1409
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:56,980
That's good.

1410
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:58,220
"Fixin' to be friendly."

1411
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,209
That can be my column headline.

1412
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,140
Oh, I guess that'd be okay.

1413
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:03,446
Have a good evening.

1414
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,660
I mentioned the name of my picture.

1415
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:07,966
I think we're supposed to do that.

1416
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:09,321
Well, now, this is interesting.

1417
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:14,402
I thought I was getting
an exclusive on this.

1418
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,881
I'd like to know
what the hell is going on here.

1419
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:20,449
Oh, well, like I said,
we just saw Lazy OI' Moon, and...

1420
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,331
And Hobie and I are fixin' to be friendly.

1421
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:25,380
What?
We're just...

1422
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:27,244
Friends, my foot!

1423
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:37,881
What's the matter, Hobie?

1424
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:42,322
I gotta skedaddle. So sorry.
Oh!

1425
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:43,500
Have to catch one of
your pictures next time.

1426
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:44,980
I'm looking forward to it.

1427
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:46,241
Bye, Hobie.

1428
01:20:58,280 --> 01:20:59,700
Hey, toss me them keys, pard.

1429
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:00,961
I'm taking the car.

1430
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:01,565
Hobie Doyle?

1431
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:03,610
You're a communist, too?

1432
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,900
So, it's commies.

1433
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,300
You ever been in this place?
Pretty nice, huh?

1434
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:12,980
It's Burt Gurney's.

1435
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:15,924
He sings, he dances, he's got taste.

1436
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:19,765
You here alone?

1437
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:21,684
Everybody else went down to the beach.

1438
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:24,810
Well, all right, pard.

1439
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:28,922
Let's us head on back to town.

1440
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:31,447
You got Mr. Mannix worried sick.

1441
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,121
Easy.

1442
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:07,446
Easy.

1443
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,081
Here!

1444
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,489
Take care of him.

1445
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:32,770
Comrade. Comrade!

1446
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:35,128
We salute you.

1447
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:38,324
You are going to Moscow
to become Soviet Man

1448
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:39,970
and help forge the future.

1449
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:44,020
We stay behind,
continuing to serve in our disguise

1450
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:46,327
as capitalist handmaidens.

1451
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:50,445
But the money should go to the cause,
not to the servants of the cause.

1452
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:51,860
Yes!
That's right.

1453
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:53,246
We... Well...

1454
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:57,647
Our modest contribution to the Comintern.

1455
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:05,491
They will be pleased.

1456
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,366
No! No!

1457
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:12,440
Engels!

1458
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:19,247
No.

1459
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:17,561
Oh.

1460
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:30,246
Oh, boy! It's late. I'm in the doghouse.

1461
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,289
Better forget about my place.

1462
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:34,408
Drop me off at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

1463
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,891
All righty.

1464
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:51,121
Huh.

1465
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:21,051
Who are you?

1466
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:22,361
Todd.

1467
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:24,360
Todd.

1468
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:27,282
You get a hot breakfast
or a box breakfast?

1469
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:29,886
I don't know.

1470
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,448
Are you a principal or an extra?

1471
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,284
I think I'm a principal.

1472
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:36,680
Yeah.

1473
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,180
I'm thinking, "What the hell?"

1474
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:42,805
Woken up in some strange houses before,
but never without a broad next to me.

1475
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:45,940
Mmm-hmm.
These guys are pretty interesting, though.

1476
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:49,980
They've actually figured out
the laws that dictate everything.

1477
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:53,687
History, sociology, politics,
morality, everything.

1478
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:56,889
It's all in a book
called Kapital, with a "K."

1479
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:58,300
That right?

1480
01:29:58,400 --> 01:29:59,686
Yeah. And you're not gonna believe this.

1481
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:03,170
These guys even figured out
what's going on here at the studio,

1482
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,500
because the studio is nothing more

1483
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:08,260
than an instrument of capitalism.
Hmm.

1484
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:12,684
Yeah, so we blindly follow these
laws like any other institution,

1485
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,740
laws that these guys figured out.

1486
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:17,620
The studio makes pictures
to serve the system.

1487
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:19,085
That is its function.

1488
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:21,163
That's really what we're up to here.

1489
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:22,851
Is it?
Yeah.

1490
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,004
It's just confirming what
they call the "status quo."

1491
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:29,100
I mean, we may tell ourselves
that we're creating

1492
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:31,168
something of artistic value,

1493
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:35,365
or there's some sort of spiritual
dimension to the picture business.

1494
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:39,771
But what it really is, is this fat cat,
Nick Schenk, out in New York,

1495
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:43,367
running this factory,
serving up these lollipops to the...

1496
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,727
What they used to call the bread
and circuses for the...

1497
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:49,681
What...

1498
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:52,680
Now, you listen to me, buster.

1499
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:54,684
Nick Schenk and this studio
have been good to you

1500
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,370
and to everyone else who works here.

1501
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:59,900
If I ever hear you bad-mouthing Mr. Schenk
again, it will be the last thing you say

1502
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,371
before I have you tossed in jail
for colluding in your own abduction.

1503
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:03,891
Eddie, I wouldn't...
I would never do that!

1504
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:06,247
Shut up!

1505
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,448
You're gonna go out there
and you're gonna finish Hail, Caesar!

1506
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,580
You're gonna give that speech
at the feet of the penitent thief,

1507
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:12,444
and you're gonna believe
every word you say.

1508
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,260
You're gonna do it because you're
an actor and that's what you do,

1509
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:17,980
just like the director does what he does,

1510
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:20,380
and the writer and the script girl
and the guy who claps the slate.

1511
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,403
You're gonna do it
because the picture has worth!

1512
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,140
And you have worth if
you serve the picture,

1513
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:26,208
and you're never gonna forget that again.

1514
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,490
I won't forget, Eddie.

1515
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:33,083
You're damn right you won't.

1516
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:35,288
Not as long as I run this dump.

1517
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,204
Baird.

1518
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,762
Go out there and be a star.

1519
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:50,446
Mr. Mannix!

1520
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:54,980
Since you're going to your car,
I thought you might wanna take this.

1521
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:56,206
What is it?

1522
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:57,651
From DeeAnna Moran.

1523
01:31:57,800 --> 01:32:00,980
Thank you, and she doesn't need
to adopt her baby after all.

1524
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:02,127
Huh?

1525
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:06,045
She asked Joe Silverman out for dinner
last night, and I guess it went well.

1526
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:09,500
They drove to Palm Springs
and were married at 3:00 this morning.

1527
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,180
Huh.

1528
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:13,180
Will you be gone long?
Today's call list to go through.

1529
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,500
No, less than an hour. Personal errand.

1530
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:17,125
It's a nice arrangement.

1531
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,850
She charged it to the studio.

1532
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,525
Right.

1533
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,167
Just coming to see you.

1534
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,441
Good morning. Uh...

1535
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:26,450
Sorry about last night, Thora.
I didn't know your sister would show up.

1536
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:29,406
Well, that's as may be,
but I certainly learned my lesson.

1537
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:33,130
Whatever you say today, Eddie Mannix,
my column tomorrow is about

1538
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:36,122
On Wings as Eagles.

1539
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:37,685
Thora, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1540
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,001
I'm sure you wouldn't.

1541
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:41,766
No, no, no, you don't understand.
Let's sit down.

1542
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:44,970
I'm telling you not to run the column,
Thora, for your own good.

1543
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:47,540
I can judge my own interest.

1544
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:49,483
This will be the story of the year.

1545
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:53,322
And it so happens the Hearst syndicate
are looking to pick up a Hollywood column.

1546
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:54,500
And you think this will cinch it for you?

1547
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:55,601
You know it will.

1548
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:58,771
Baird Whitlock, your biggest star,

1549
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,500
got his first major part
in On Wings as Eagles

1550
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,250
by engaging in sodomy

1551
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:07,260
with the picture's director,
Laurence Laurentz.

1552
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:08,930
Oh, we've all heard the story.

1553
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:11,003
But here's something you haven't heard.

1554
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:13,447
Your source is a communist.

1555
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:16,567
If you print it, it'll be dismissed
as a commie smear tactic,

1556
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:19,121
and you'll be dismissed
as a commie stooge.

1557
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:20,900
Burt Gurney has left the country.

1558
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,606
The cell he was part of has
been smashed by the police.

1559
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:25,260
Might have thought he was credible

1560
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:27,840
because he's Mr. Laurentz's
current protégé,

1561
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:32,044
but you don't want to be seen as
Burt Gurney's mouthpiece after this.

1562
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:35,162
How did you know Burt was my source?

1563
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:38,569
Late last night, I talked to Laurence,
put two and two together.

1564
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:41,326
Well, no reason to send this
since I ran into you.

1565
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:44,211
It's my way of apology for Thessaly
horning in last night.

1566
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:46,169
I do value our friendship, Thora,

1567
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,163
but I'm late for something important.

1568
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:13,365
Why on your knees before
this Hebrew, Autolochus?

1569
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:16,091
I encountered him before, Gracchus.

1570
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:18,561
Beside the well of Jehosaphat.

1571
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:22,569
And what manner of man.

1572
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:26,522
He's a priest of the Israelites,
despised even by the other priests.

1573
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:27,881
No.

1574
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:33,087
On yesterday's march,
punished by the dust of the road,

1575
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:36,980
I sought to drink first at the well,
before the slaves in my charge,

1576
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:39,765
whose thirst was far greater than my own.

1577
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:42,082
A Roman drinks before a slave.

1578
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:44,089
This man was giving water to all.

1579
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:47,284
He saw no Roman, he saw no slave.

1580
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:51,809
He saw only men, weak men,
and gave succor.

1581
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:56,288
He saw suffering, which he sought to ease.

1582
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:58,727
He saw sin, and gave love.

1583
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:01,129
Love, Autolochus?

1584
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:04,526
He saw my own sin, Gracchus, and greed.

1585
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:09,124
But in his eyes, I saw
no shadow of reproach.

1586
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:12,089
I saw only light.

1587
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:14,649
The light of God.

1588
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:17,481
You mean, of the gods.

1589
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:21,180
I do not, friend Gracchus.

1590
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:23,851
This Hebrew is a son of the one God.

1591
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,480
The God of this far-flung tribe.

1592
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:30,169
And why shouldn't
God's anointed appear here

1593
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:33,763
among these strange people,
to shoulder their sins?

1594
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:39,566
Here, Gracchus, in this sun-drenched land.

1595
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,480
Why should He not take this form,

1596
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:44,963
the form of an ordinary man?

1597
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:49,810
A man bringing us not the old truths,
but a new one.

1598
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:53,005
A new truth?

1599
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:56,369
A truth beyond the truth that we can see.

1600
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:59,326
A truth beyond this world.

1601
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:04,004
A truth told not in words, but in light.

1602
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:07,962
A truth that we could see if we had but...

1603
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:11,008
If we had but...

1604
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:16,206
Cut! Cut! "Faith! Have but faith!"

1605
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:18,567
"Faith."

1606
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:20,643
"Faith. Faith!" God damn it!

1607
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:22,006
Go one again.
Isn't it...

1608
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:23,207
They changed it.

1609
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:25,362
You got most of it, man. You're all right.

1610
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:27,762
All right, hang on.

1611
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:29,980
Can I get a pat down?
I'm sweating like a pig in this thing.

1612
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:31,081
Ah, son of a bitch!

1613
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:40,088
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

1614
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:43,531
How long since your
last confession, my son?

1615
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:47,048
It's been, what, 27 hours.

1616
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:51,842
It's really too often, my son.

1617
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,206
You're not that bad.

1618
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:55,124
I don't know, Father.

1619
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:58,443
I snuck a cigarette. Or two.

1620
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:01,567
I didn't make it home in time for dinner.

1621
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:08,805
And I, uh, struck a movie star in anger.

1622
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:14,085
All right.

1623
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:16,083
Five Hail Marys.

1624
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:18,285
Okay.

1625
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:20,605
Okay.

1626
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:22,931
Father?

1627
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:25,211
Yes, my son.

1628
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:27,562
May I ask you something, Father?

1629
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:31,484
Of course, my son.

1630
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:38,440
If there's something that's easy,

1631
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:41,562
is that wrong?

1632
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:43,406
Easy?

1633
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:45,767
Yeah, easy to do.

1634
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:47,644
Easy to...

1635
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,251
Like, an easy job.

1636
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:52,244
No, it's not a bad job. It's not bad.

1637
01:37:55,280 --> 01:38:00,241
But, then, there's this
other job that's not so easy.

1638
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:03,131
No, in fact, it's hard.

1639
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:04,645
It's so hard, Father...

1640
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:10,483
Sometimes I don't know if I can
keep doing it, but it seems right.

1641
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,962
I don't know how to explain.

1642
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,644
God wants us to do what's right.

1643
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:28,366
Yeah.

1644
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,650
Yeah, of course He does.

1645
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:34,730
The inner voice that
tells you what's right,

1646
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,486
it comes from God, my son.

1647
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:38,806
Yeah, I got it.

1648
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,325
That's His way of saying that...

1649
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:42,005
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

1650
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:43,685
Still raining in Gallup, New Mexico.

1651
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:46,486
And the Tucumcari crew has shot all
the plates we need for Came the Rain.

1652
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:49,180
Well, just shoot the showdown
in the weather and we'll retitle it.

1653
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:52,727
Tucumcari Tempest,
Desert Squall, Hold Back The Storm.

1654
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:55,247
The stories begin, the stories end.

1655
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:56,686
I don't know, bounce it off the writers.

1656
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:57,780
So it has been.

1657
01:38:57,880 --> 01:38:58,900
Here's today's call list.

1658
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,526
Add a call to a Mr. Cuddahy
at the Lockheed Corporation.

1659
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:03,045
Long call? Short?

1660
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:05,089
"Thanks, but no thanks."
How long was that?

1661
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:06,420
But the story of Eddie Mannix...

1662
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:07,740
Who do we call first?

1663
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:09,180
...will never end.

1664
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:10,420
New York first.

1665
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:11,726
Time to check in with Mr. Schenk.

1666
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:16,881
For his is a tale written
in light everlasting.
