1
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:28,410
Makoto77.

2
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,309
- Hey kid!
- What?

3
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,480
I found something.
You should see this.

4
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,410
Jumanji.

5
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,480
Board game. Who
plays a board game?

6
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,500
Okay, okay, gate 1, uppercut.

7
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:23,360
Perfect, you lose. Attack,
attack, counterattack, and slam.

8
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:30,460
- Okay, all right.
- YOU KNOW.

9
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,440
Strange house in 20 minutes.

10
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:42,300
Benjamin Franklin, and his
exceptional nationalism.

11
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,300
Burning the spirit of
Westward expansion.

12
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,259
- Spencer, I'm coming.
- Ah!

13
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,420
Mom, what did we say about
knocking on the door?

14
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,440
I'm late for work, are you going straight
to your dad's house after school?

15
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,429
- Yes, maybe.
- Do not forget your equipment.

16
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,410
And please, remember it's a
horrible place, be careful.

17
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,269
I love you more than life itself.
See you Sunday night.

18
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,240
Okay.

19
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,500
- Bye, mom.
- Eat something before you go.

20
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,379
I can not, I'm going
to Spencer's house.

21
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,330
- Spencer Gilbert?
- Yes, Spencer Gilbert.

22
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,510
He, he taught me, helps
me get good grades.

23
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,240
I'm glad to hear that,
Spencer Gilbert.

24
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,305
Will your score be good?

25
00:04:23,315 --> 00:04:24,370
Yes mother, that's why
I'm asking for help.

26
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,340
I want you to get
out of his team.

27
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,420
I will not get out of his team.

28
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,330
That .. That'll be fine. OK?

29
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,320
Sweet, right?

30
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,310
Yes.

31
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:04,390
Bethanywalker: Just getting out of bed.
Uh, good morning.

32
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,300
- Yo.
- Hey Fridge.

33
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,249
Why are you wearing raincoats?

34
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,340
- What do you mean?
- I mean, it's not raining.

35
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,230
Oh, well, I mean, it could rain.

36
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,290
- God.
- What the fuck, man?

37
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,499
Do you mind, can we finish this?
This is very uncomfortable.

38
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,270
Here it is.

39
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,409
- Have you checked everything?
- Yes, I checked it.

40
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:50,430
And I already gave the
prefix and the suffix ..

41
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,470
And something in the middle.

42
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,449
Listen, man, I'll do it
myself if I have time.

43
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,460
Yes, no big deal.

44
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:02,350
Hey, I thought, so, I mean, it's nice to
help you and do your homework, but ..

45
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,410
I do not know what your activities
are this weekend, but I think ..

46
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,280
This weekend, yeah, uh ..

47
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,490
- Hey Fridge.
- Hey.

48
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,410
You need a ride?

49
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,299
- I'll come with him.
- No, that's better for me.

50
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,290
I also have my own schedule. See
you later, " Refrigerator ".

51
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:26,300
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Hello, guys.

52
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,470
Forget .. He's not your best
friend during your childhood.

53
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:36,320
What did you say?

54
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,490
Uh, nothing, sir.

55
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,360
- Uh, that guy is so weird.
- Poor guy.

56
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,269
What happened to
them was terrible.

57
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,450
- I'm talking about his son.
- What are you doing here?

58
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,309
I was talking to
my friend first.

59
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,360
- You should be more careful, you hear?
- Yes, Mr. Rick.

60
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:03,410
- I understand.
- This world swallows kids like you.

61
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,480
It took me two hours to
create another content.

62
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,450
Because I do not like it.
Did you see it?

63
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,370
Yes, of course. I do not
know who it is from.

64
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,490
Thanks, and it's not always like that,
but it's enough to stay relevant.

65
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:36,460
- But that's funny.
- Is there a strange person behind you?

66
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,430
- Hi.
- Hi.

67
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,289
Bethany, did you call
during the exam?

68
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,240
Yes, but I have
finished my exam.

69
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,390
Oh, okay. Do you realize that the
other students have not finished yet?

70
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,250
- So?
- Oh, sorry.

71
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:56,420
Let me repeat. You're more weird than
the other people in his world, right?

72
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,370
Listen, um, you know, now
I have affairs, and ..

73
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,279
Believe me, I know how
hard it is to be you,

74
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,400
I'm having a crisis, and, Lucinda,
I mean, she made me a woman

75
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,320
and it feels like maybe
you should do it too.

76
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,430
- Just close the phone.
- Okay, no problem.

77
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,289
- Bethany. Close it now.
- 2 more minutes and I'm done.

78
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,470
And that's the tension.

79
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:24,260
Okay, stretch her hand. Come on!

80
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,220
- Bethany, you're late.
- Sorry!

81
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,320
I heard she split with him.

82
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,330
Maybe this is your chance, man.

83
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:40,290
Okay, we'll practice a catch, so
find your partner and grab a ball.

84
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,370
Let's move!

85
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:48,300
Hey, Martha. Martha. You can
not play capture alone.

86
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,489
Find pair. Come on. Hurry.

87
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,410
No, I'm fine.

88
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:57,260
Okay.

89
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,299
You must participate,
like everything else.

90
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,390
Otherwise why are you here?

91
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,520
That's a requirement.

92
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,360
- Martha ..
- This is useless.

93
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,410
The gym class will not take
me to Princeton, and I'm not

94
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,460
obsessed with throwing balls
and jumps, and oh, goals!

95
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,470
Okay, there's a lot
wrong with that, but ..

96
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:22,289
It's physical activity, good for you,
with other people, also good for you.

97
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,340
And if you try it,
maybe you like it.

98
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,259
Have fun. That's what we're
doing here, having fun?

99
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,210
It's a school, we should
learn something important.

100
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,380
- Okay.
- We do not have much time in this life.

101
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,430
And I do not want to spend it
by being a sports teacher.

102
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,440
- That sounds wrong ..
- Yes, of course.

103
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,349
That's a hold.

104
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:51,330
- That's very hard.
- Cool.

105
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,380
Spencer Gilbert.

106
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,360
Sit down, Spencer.

107
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,300
Mrs. Mathers.

108
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,775
And with its exceptional
sense of nationalism,

109
00:10:14,785 --> 00:10:18,260
which fueled the spirit
of Westward expansion.

110
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,310
Does that sound familiar, Mr.
Gilbert?

111
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,400
No.

112
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,340
That's the last sentence of Anthony's
assignment on Westward expansion.

113
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,800
And by chance, it's the
last sentence of your

114
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,260
assignment about Westwood's
expansion from last year.

115
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:38,290
That's interesting.

116
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,460
- Really?
- I think so.

117
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,490
I mean, how likely is it?

118
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,490
Very small.

119
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,239
Yes, you also use
the same metaphor.

120
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,290
Deployment on your assignment
about the Boston Tea Party.

121
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:56,410
Gettysburg Battle and
women's suffrage.

122
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,480
- In this room is very hot.
- Anthony.

123
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:05,470
I know you really need to pass in my
class, but this is not the way you do it.

124
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,429
- I will not tolerate cheats.
- Cheating?

125
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:12,420
- I'm not, I'm not cheating.
- It's my fault.

126
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,490
I made him do it.

127
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:21,390
You made him tell
you to do his work?

128
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,379
Yes.

129
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,500
Hm-hm.

130
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:32,510
- Listen, I'm sorry. Okay?
- No, that's not okay.

131
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,470
What the hell, dude, you
can not betray his team.

132
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,319
Yes, but you will
get me removed.

133
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,489
Not only are you
having trouble here.

134
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,480
- Having trouble?
- Yes.

135
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,400
The most dangerous thing
I've ever done in my life.

136
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,500
And now look at me. I
accept the consequences.

137
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,320
Well, this is a fun group.

138
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,500
Welcome to containment.

139
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,379
- Yes, Spencer?
- I just want to apologize.

140
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,460
- Thanks.
- Principal Bentley, all I do ..

141
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,500
Bethany, please, you are here for
a reason, you know what it is.

142
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,440
This is what you
have to think about.

143
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:12,450
Who are you at this time?

144
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,410
And, you want to be what.

145
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:22,230
You have one life, you decide
how you guys will live it.

146
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:28,279
Fortunately, there is no better place
to mirror than the quarantine place.

147
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,510
Everything stands up, come on.

148
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,259
We will convert this to
a new computer center.

149
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,280
But before we do, it
should be cleared.

150
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,529
All of these old magazines
will be sent to recycling.

151
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,510
But it must be set up
before it is sent.

152
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:57,399
It seems that all the
stappler must be separated.

153
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,420
Whatever you do not finish
today, you finish tomorrow.

154
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,290
- But tomorrow is Saturday.
- Because I do not want ..

155
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,539
Yes, I do not think
it will work.

156
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,479
- That's fair.
- Shut up.

157
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,460
So I guess you can start.

158
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,470
Select your equipment.

159
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,450
Why is there a
bowling ball here?

160
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:24,380
Really? No signal? Okay,
can this day be any worse?

161
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,299
Are you going to help
or you're too pretty?

162
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,240
I'm too pretty.

163
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,470
Hey. Yesterday I watched
you with his coach.

164
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,349
I mean I'm not paying attention
to you, not in a strange way.

165
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,260
I just, I'm in the
same class as you.

166
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:49,240
But I think you said the smart thing
about why the gym lesson sucks, and ..

167
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,240
About other subjects.

168
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,250
Thanks.

169
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,420
Yes.

170
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,430
Yo, what is this?

171
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:08,390
- I do not know.
- Is this some kind of old Nintendo?

172
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,470
I do not think so.

173
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,410
I do not recognize it.

174
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:32,480
A game for those looking for ..

175
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,399
A way to leave their world.

176
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,350
WELCOME TO JUMANJl

177
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,390
Jumanji.

178
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,339
Friends, staples.

179
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:45,230
- Jumanji, what does it mean?
- I do not know, never heard of it.

180
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,240
SELECT CHARACTER

181
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,345
Ah, which one do I choose?

182
00:14:51,355 --> 00:14:53,430
I do not know, I do not
think it matters much.

183
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:58,359
Jefferson " Seaplane" McDonough.
Pilots and bastards.

184
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,380
- This does not work.
- Okay, try something else.

185
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,329
- Franklin " Moose " Finbar.
- Hm ..

186
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,310
This looks cool.

187
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:11,270
And he's an animal
expert, that's cool.

188
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,300
- You select.
- Okay.

189
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:21,310
Doctor Smolder Bravestone.

190
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,410
- Bethany, do you want to come?
- All right.

191
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,380
I will choose Shelly Oberon.

192
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,510
The sexy genius.

193
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:40,280
- Put your staples, come on. Your turn.
- Uh, no thanks.

194
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,360
Wait, just a minute?
This will be fun.

195
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:46,340
He does not like to have fun.

196
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,320
Okay.

197
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,370
Okay.

198
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,349
This is probably the dumbest
thing I've ever done.

199
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,290
I highly doubt that.

200
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,490
Welcome to Jumanji.

201
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,310
What's happening?

202
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:25,480
I think it is shorting.

203
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,320
Unplug the cord!

204
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:44,220
- What's happening? What's in your hands?
- What's wrong with you?

205
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,320
I do not know.

206
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,370
Oh no, oh my God!

207
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:08,480
What the hell, dude?
Oh no, oh no!

208
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,520
Come!

209
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:48,330
Guys! This does not
sound like my voice.

210
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,300
Where's my hair?

211
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,319
What the hell?

212
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,440
Oh my God!

213
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,470
It's stupid.

214
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,210
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

215
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,300
Who is it?

216
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,310
Who are you?

217
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,370
Good. What the fuck ..

218
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,450
- God! Oh, my God!
- Get out of me!

219
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,440
What's done? What's
wrong with my voice?

220
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,259
- Get out of me. Watch out!
- Where am I?

221
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,230
Move!

222
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,420
Oh ..

223
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,500
What happened ..

224
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:11,500
Happened to me? What is this?
What's on my back?

225
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,350
- What's this?
- Oh, my God.

226
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,430
Fridge?

227
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,510
I'm Fridge, who are you?

228
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,250
I'm Spencer.

229
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,280
What? Who are you?
What's going on?

230
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:34,229
- I think we are in the game.
- Excuse me?

231
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,380
- You are talking about ..
- Somehow ..

232
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,250
I do not know how .. I think we
like being sucked into the game.

233
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,330
And we become the
avatar we choose.

234
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:49,510
So here I am, Spencer. But I look and
sound like Doctor Smolder Bravesound.

235
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,820
You told me you were Spencer?

236
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,270
Yes, yes. Yes. That's right.
Fridge, I'm Spencer.

237
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:04,480
Which .. Which you are Mush Spinbar.
Written on your mantle.

238
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,429
And ..

239
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:10,380
- Marta? You are a Ruby Warrenhouse.
- Yes.

240
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,309
Bethany. You are
Professor Sally Oberoun.

241
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,290
It's just that Shally must
be short for Sheldon.

242
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:19,279
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. He's right.

243
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:25,300
- And you .. And you Spencer? You?
- Yes. Guys, I'm telling you.

244
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,510
I'm Spencer. I'm Spencer...

245
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,340
- Yes, it's Spencer.
- Wow.

246
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,320
So, that means I ..

247
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,529
Wait.

248
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,470
No!

249
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:47,290
I'm a Norwegian.

250
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:52,470
Ah, I have a tattoo. My mom always said
she would kill me if I had a tattoo.

251
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,310
I also have a tattoo.

252
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,370
Sometimes.

253
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:04,290
Wait a minute,
where is my phone?

254
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,290
Why am I wearing this
outfit in the Jungle?

255
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,510
I'm a bit short with my
leather tops, what's this?

256
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:15,369
I look like a walking park.
Where's my phone?

257
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,339
- Who cares?
- We are in someone else's body.

258
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,290
That does not seem the most
important at the moment.

259
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,300
Oh, really? You do not think
this is not a good time to call?

260
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:27,490
Or send a message to anyone? Or
change your status in the game?

261
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:31,249
What I'm saying is that I do
not have my Clentine, either?

262
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,410
And I'm almost allergic
to everything.

263
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:36,300
Oh, no. You have
allergies, Spencer?

264
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,310
Oh, I do not have a
tattoo on my body.

265
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,510
You guys are really
not possible.

266
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,429
It's possible that
we're all in a coma.

267
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:47,369
Together? We're all
in a coma, together?

268
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:51,460
You heard, that's the only
best explanation .. Like ..

269
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,330
Oh my God!

270
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,319
Oh, my God. You better
go down save him.

271
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,370
I will not go in there.
You go in there.

272
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,310
Oh, No, I'm wearing a backpack.

273
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,350
You do not go into the water with
a backpack, everyone knows that.

274
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,399
Ouch!

275
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,500
- What?
- Bethany.

276
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,470
Are you okay?

277
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,260
That's very stressful.

278
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,249
I can not seem to get
away from this place.

279
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,340
- What just happened to you?
- I've just been fed by a rhinoceros.

280
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,510
And then I fell from a
thousand feet from the sky.

281
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,240
- Yes, it looks like that.
- It was a hippo.

282
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:48,320
Near the river, hippos fast and
provide 800 Newt pressure.

283
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,399
How do I know this?

284
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,299
- You are a wildlife expert.
- What?

285
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,320
- I'm still a fat guy, right?
- I'm afraid so.

286
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,320
Wait, why do everything calm
down with this. I mean, he ..

287
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:03,300
- From the sky.
- Hm, buddy.

288
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:10,340
Bethany, wake up! Run!

289
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,280
Run!

290
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,250
Run ..

291
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,380
Come on, come on, come on.

292
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,530
Oh, Doctor Bravestone.
Welcome to Jumanji.

293
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,450
Do not just stand
there, let's get in.

294
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:33,440
- Come on, come on!
- Come on, come on!

295
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,370
Come on.

296
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,249
Doctor Bravestone.

297
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,470
Famous archaeologist and
international explorer.

298
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:52,450
Already past 7 continents,
with bold browsing.

299
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,390
- Seriously, buddy.
- I can not tell you how honorable.

300
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,280
To meet you.

301
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,490
I'm not ashamed to say that you're
more handsome is seen directly.

302
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,380
- Thanks.
- Who are you.

303
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,460
Nigel Viegsly, serving you.
Ruby Roundhouse. Male lover.

304
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,390
Welcome to Jumanji.

305
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:12,470
I'm very impatient
for your arrival.

306
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,310
What do you know, Jumanji
is in great danger.

307
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,479
We depend on the four of
you to remove the curse.

308
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,319
- Curse?
- What curse?

309
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,380
Excuse me. Do you see
my phone anywhere?

310
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:26,440
Professor Sheldon Oberon.
Welcome to Jumanji.

311
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,429
Nigel Viegsly serves you.

312
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:31,310
I'm very impatient
for your arrival.

313
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,310
- What did he say?
- I think he's an NPC.

314
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:37,299
- What? Please speak English.
- Non-player characters.

315
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,239
He's one part of the game.
So whatever we ask him.

316
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,390
Anyway he's programmed to
respond to several things.

317
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,400
Understandable. Now
everything is clear.

318
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:47,330
Franklin Mouse Springberg.
Welcome to Jumanji.

319
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,470
Muse? Not a Mouse.

320
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,419
Oh, no, sir. I'm
pretty sure Mouse.

321
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,389
- Mouse?
- At this moment, from your structure.

322
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:57,270
And amazing behavior.
And you're here.

323
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:01,229
Doctor Bravestone will not go
anywhere without his trusted friends.

324
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,380
Friend?

325
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,250
Since Doctor Bravestone saved you from
Kunco oro-oro in the Peruvian jungle.

326
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,480
You never leave the side.

327
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,369
- Really?
- Can we discuss the curse again?

328
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:14,220
It's all in the letter sent
to you, Doctor Bravestone.

329
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,330
Maybe you should read aloud.

330
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,280
I have no mail ..

331
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:23,250
Wow.

332
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,319
Okay.

333
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:32,380
Doctor Bravestone. I'm writing to you
in severe situations in Jumanji.

334
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:35,290
We need your help.

335
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,380
Comrade, what's going on?

336
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,450
- What's going on?
- I think this is a scene snippet.

337
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:44,320
Many games have movie trailers to
support their background story.

338
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:49,270
My name is Nigel Viegsly.
Jumanji tour guide.

339
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,239
I was hired by Paul Parker.

340
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,270
Your bitter enemy. Professor Van Pelt.
To guide a good expedition.

341
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,470
You know, Doctor Van Pelt did a similar
search on the lethal jaguar tribe.

342
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:07,290
Graves located at the center
of the sacred Jumanji.

343
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,290
What you know surpasses
anyone, he is very obsessed.

344
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:15,420
And after years of research, he believes
in arriving at his destination.

345
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,500
Yes, I finally found it.

346
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:23,390
Van Pelt says he wants to find his gem
in order to perfect the document.

347
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:26,240
And he found it.

348
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,530
- This is real.
- Which I do not know.

349
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:34,320
He wants to take his
gem for himself.

350
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:45,229
I got it!

351
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:49,330
I got it!

352
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:54,300
The ancient manuscript says
that the Jaguars keep Jumanji.

353
00:26:54,310 --> 00:27:00,270
And whoever is blinded by it.
Will be consumed by dark forces.

354
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:05,330
And Van Pelt became the master
of the creature Jumanji.

355
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:08,319
Entering them. Control them.

356
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:13,420
And the bad curse once
again controls this land.

357
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:18,450
I asked him to return it,
but once in his handle.

358
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,260
He will never release it.

359
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,420
So I waited until she
fell asleep that night.

360
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,410
And I'm doing my business.

361
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,440
Capture the guide!

362
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:55,400
And kill anyone who
tries to stop you.

363
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,470
Then, here it is.

364
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,420
With your valuable help
and your companion.

365
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,470
You must use your special skills to
restore gems in the eyes of a jaguar.

366
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,240
And remove the curse.

367
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,460
I'm sure you want to
start right away.

368
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,330
- Actually I think ..
- Good luck ..

369
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:15,480
Fate Jumanji is in your hands.

370
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,240
- What?
- And remember ..

371
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,389
Your goal is pleasure
and suspense.

372
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,520
Restore the gem and
remove the curse.

373
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:26,350
If you expect to leave the
game, you must save Jumanji.

374
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:29,250
And mentioned his name.

375
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,260
Good luck. Jumanji's
destiny is in your hands.

376
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:35,420
- And remember, The goal...
- He said the same thing.

377
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,260
Restore the permission
and remove the curse.

378
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,340
If you want to leave the game.
You must save Jumanji.

379
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:44,280
And mentioned his name.

380
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,480
That's okay. We can handle this.

381
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:52,240
In the real world, people love you,
you can meet whoever you want.

382
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,389
That's how you tell yourself
when you're scared?

383
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,440
Can not you rate me for a while?

384
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:00,260
I'm in somewhere, I turn into a
man, and I can not find my phone!

385
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,390
I'm allowed to be sad.

386
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,520
Doctor Bravestone,
here's a map of Jumanji.

387
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,400
You should go to Bazaar
looking for the missing part.

388
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:09,400
- Bazaar.
- Looking for some what?

389
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:12,330
- Goodbye.
- Do you think a mouse on a statue?

390
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,400
And remember, if you want
to leave the game ..

391
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,350
You must save Jumanji.
And mentioned his name.

392
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,410
Do you want to put
it in the backpack?

393
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:33,260
No. - Come on, you're the only
one who has a backpack, Fridge.

394
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,450
Then what? We have a map,
so we have to search ..

395
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,320
Bazaar, I think.

396
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:42,309
So, we try to return the
gem to the jaguar statue.

397
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,360
And then, then we go home.
No problem.

398
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:49,310
Why can not we just go? Stop the
game, without doing everything.

399
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,340
We need to finish the game.

400
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:58,260
I think .. I think we
should save Jumanji.

401
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:09,430
Shit, there's a guy over there.

402
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,340
Do not cry! Do not Cry! Do not Cry!
Do not Cry! Do not Cry! Do not cry!

403
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,360
Do not cry!

404
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,249
There are very many
outbreaks out here.

405
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,430
This is hot.

406
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,510
Okay, here's what I'm ahead of me.
Play a video game.

407
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,419
This is what I do,
the main thing I do.

408
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,440
Play a game like this,
there will be a level.

409
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,289
In order to complete the game,
you must complete all levels.

410
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,259
The level will become even
harder when we finish it.

411
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:39,250
- We finish the level ..
- Excuse me, do you know where we're going?

412
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,420
- Somewhat.
- Somewhat?

413
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,490
Oh, that's great.

414
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,350
We are being well guided.

415
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:47,350
I think the missing part.

416
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:50,270
Oh, my God, that's definitely what we're
looking for, the missing map part.

417
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,340
Right above it. Nothing here.

418
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:55,530
What do you mean there
is nothing there.

419
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:58,279
It's a map like he said.

420
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,480
This is a map from Jumanji.

421
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:03,310
- Cartography.
- What's that?

422
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,480
You said it was a map. That's one
of Oberon professor's abilities.

423
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,340
Yes. That's right.

424
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,299
Oh, so you can not see this.
But I can.

425
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,250
The characters we choose
have special abilities.

426
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:16,250
So there must be a way of
accessing our capabilities ..

427
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,330
Oh ..

428
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,360
- Wow.
- What did you just do?

429
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:26,279
Strength. No fear. Climbing.
Speed. Boomerang.

430
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,370
Burning intensity.

431
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,370
What are you doing?

432
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,289
What just happened?

433
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,280
You just burned.

434
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:43,290
Weakness: Nothing?

435
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,420
How did you do that? List it.

436
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:51,269
Well, well, I thought, I
just pressed my big chest.

437
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,420
Yes, breasts here.
Let me show you.

438
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,300
Away from me.

439
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:58,290
At least tap in front of us
so we know where exactly ..

440
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:02,510
Strength: Karate, T'ai
Chi, Aikido, fight dance?

441
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,380
Dance battle? Is that something?

442
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:09,250
Weakness: Toxins.

443
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,340
Serious.

444
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,480
Peleontology? What
does that mean?

445
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,469
Studying fossils, I think?

446
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,410
That's kinda cool.

447
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:26,369
POWER, ZOOLOGl, WEAKNESS
WEAPON, CAKE, SPEED, STRENGTH.

448
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,350
I hate this game.

449
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:30,290
Weakness, cookies?

450
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:36,249
Yes, cookies are my weakness.
Along with speed and power.

451
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,410
Strength is my weakness.

452
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,480
Hey, can I, quick question.

453
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:43,270
How is strength my weakness?

454
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,510
Someone explained to me.
Why do I need speed?

455
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:50,429
Why do I need to be fast while I'm being
chased by a big zebra killer and whatever?

456
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,510
On this stupid hat.

457
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:54,429
You are also good
at storing weapons.

458
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,430
What does that mean?

459
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,450
Well, I thought you
were carrying my gun ..

460
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:03,310
In your backpack and you give
it to me when I need it.

461
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:07,440
Comrade. The map .. It is ..

462
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,500
- Changed.
- What does it mean?

463
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,310
- What's being said?
- Okay, well ..

464
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,480
There is not much information but in
the past, it does not write this.

465
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:19,420
Dam now exists. It
says, mighty Aungan.

466
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,450
I do not like that. I'm done.

467
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,350
- What else?
- Good.

468
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:34,309
And right here, it says, from D.

469
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:38,390
- Hippos come from depth. The one ..
- Yes, thank you, do the thing.

470
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:40,330
That's it, go ahead.

471
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:45,300
Then, from D is the first level. Then
Aungan Perkasa must be the second level.

472
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,310
Which direction?

473
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,500
Good. By GuAVAbERRY.

474
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,420
If it's east,

475
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:55,230
And it's here.

476
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,290
Right here, I thought.

477
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:13,270
What is this game?

478
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:16,310
Run!

479
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,410
Wait!

480
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,390
Come on!

481
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:43,500
Why is my track so slow?

482
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:49,260
- Run!
- Run, run!

483
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,410
We have to go, yes!

484
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,290
This is crap!

485
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,330
Oh my God!

486
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,520
Wow.

487
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,299
- Come on!
- Those guys have big guns!

488
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:44,269
- Oh, really? That's the last one.
- Take off your rucksack.

489
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,450
- Or what?
- In your rucksack. You have my gun!

490
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:49,310
- Oh.
- Come on, down, down!

491
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:54,279
Oh. Have your weapon.

492
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,410
- Oh, no, no. What is this?
- Yes, boomerang, one of my supremacy.

493
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,500
What are you going
to do with it?

494
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,380
I do not know, I guess kill.

495
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,470
- You wanna kill him with that?
- You got a better idea?

496
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:05,460
Oh watch out.

497
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,390
Watch this.

498
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,460
Good work.

499
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:18,500
We need to get out of here right
away before they finish us.

500
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,450
Oh oh, no, oh my God.

501
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,290
This works!

502
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:44,290
Okay, we have to go.

503
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,460
I can not beat their speed.

504
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,530
We have to go, go up to my back.

505
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,480
- I'd rather die.
- Come on my back.

506
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,270
No, I'll just die.

507
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:58,310
Put me down, drop me!

508
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,360
I do not think it looks
like this eventually.

509
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,450
No, no, no.

510
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,429
- We have to jump.
- Are you crazy?

511
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:23,520
We have no way other
than jump now.

512
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:27,500
- Jump!
- What the fuck!

513
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,865
We have to jump.

514
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,240
We do not even know the
depth of the water.

515
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:36,360
- We have to jump.
- No, I do not want to jump.

516
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,250
Jump, jump!

517
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:01,350
Ah, I think I got my gout.

518
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:03,470
It was the most embarrassing
moment of my life.

519
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,390
I will not do that again.

520
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,400
I'm most afraid of water.

521
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:15,319
He got me.

522
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,300
Oh no.

523
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,520
Martha?

524
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,380
Hey what just happened?

525
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,230
Is he dead? Is he dead?

526
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,260
Wait a moment.

527
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:36,240
What's that?

528
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,490
- You land on my back.
- You okay?

529
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:41,449
- I think.
- Get rid of.

530
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:44,400
- You're okay?
- You want to kill me?

531
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:47,320
Do you want to kill me?

532
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:52,405
As I thought. Remember
our initial fall from

533
00:38:52,415 --> 00:38:55,440
the sky, this little
tattoo till our arm.

534
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,480
By God, have you seen this?

535
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,490
Spencer.

536
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,310
What do you say?

537
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,320
This is our life count.

538
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,530
Bethany eaten by kudanil
so stay 2 lines.

539
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,450
He is right.

540
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:11,410
Briefly, what happens if
all the lines are gone?

541
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:17,430
Well that means gameover.

542
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:20,230
What do you mean game over?

543
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,370
Do you mean we can
actually die here?

544
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,519
- I mean I'm not sure.
- You're not sure?

545
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,440
You're not sure Mr. Video Game?

546
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:34,460
Well, I'm also stuck here, okay?
But I think yes, we can die.

547
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:38,400
That is my biggest concern now.

548
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,320
We should find a way out.

549
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,340
Okay.

550
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,410
There seems to be another
village behind this mountain.

551
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:55,249
Maybe it's the village.

552
00:39:55,250 --> 00:40:01,320
- Let's do it.
- Wait a minute, I have to urinate first.

553
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:05,490
I've been holding it all day,
but I can not take it anymore.

554
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:09,430
Can I come with you
and show you how?

555
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,500
I might need your help.

556
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:18,440
Oh yes, sure, I'll help.

557
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:23,260
So how do I do that?

558
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,370
Just a little bit out.

559
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:31,480
Remember to navigate,
it's very important.

560
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:36,420
Oh my God, you are serious, there
is a penis attached to my body.

561
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:40,380
- Martha, look at my cock.
- No thanks.

562
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,229
Is this the first
time you saw it?

563
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,380
Yes, this is the first
time I've seen it.

564
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:51,370
I've seen it when I was in junior
high school, that's a great thing.

565
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,360
Are you .. what are you doing?
Did you see it?

566
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,349
- Okay.
- Do not look here.

567
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:58,260
You never see, that's important.

568
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,450
Okay, good boy, we'll slow down
slowly, hopefully not hurt.

569
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,289
- Now what?
- Navigate, do not forget to point.

570
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:08,240
What's wrong with redirecting?
What's wrong with you?

571
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,229
Can we not discuss
this all the time?

572
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,480
Wow, wow, wow.

573
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:16,250
Oh this is much easier!

574
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:20,290
- Cool right?
- Yes, because it's so easy to set up.

575
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:24,330
The fact I'm holding the
penis is now so crazy.

576
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,230
Where is the stone?

577
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,420
In a safe place.

578
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,260
They are blurry?

579
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,370
We lost them in the forest.

580
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,470
I already know.

581
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:05,279
What do you mean sir?

582
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,370
I want every creature and
every soldier to hunt them.

583
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:13,480
Take what is mine.

584
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,490
Find them.

585
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,420
Be careful with the
land of friends.

586
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,320
The ground is slippery, I do not want
you to wound ankle anymore here.

587
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:30,310
- We can walk anyway.
- Okay.

588
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,260
- Hey can I borrow your coat? Thanks.
- Yes of course.

589
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,410
- What are you doing?
- I feel I'm wearing a bikini at school.

590
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,370
I did that once, they
saw me like anything.

591
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:44,350
Of course. - You know it's when you show
your skin, it's like in a relationship.

592
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:48,960
Really? Seriously, I
can not open my mouth

593
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:52,480
around you, you do not
know me but you hate me.

594
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:56,430
Wow, a moment, I
do not hate you.

595
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,350
- Really?
- No.

596
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:03,315
I just thought you were
like a popular girl,

597
00:43:03,325 --> 00:43:07,279
everybody treats you
special, like princess.

598
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:13,310
Maybe that's what makes you
think about yourself, maybe?

599
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,259
That's fair.

600
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:20,410
But do you think maybe the
reason you are so judgmental...

601
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:25,310
is because you see people not like
you so you do not like them first?

602
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:27,390
No.

603
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,460
Maybe. Maybe.

604
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,290
Okay then.

605
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:38,300
I just said you're
good, that's all.

606
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,509
Thanks.

607
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:43,310
I think.

608
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,520
- Get away from me, Spencer.
- Why are you so mad at me?

609
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:56,410
My friend, do you
really ask me that?

610
00:43:56,430 --> 00:44:03,490
You got me kicked out of school,
and you got me stuck here.

611
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:08,450
Oh we're not friends anymore, because
you're stuck in Jumanji? I do not think so.

612
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:11,460
We are not friends anymore because I'm
not cool enough to hang out with you.

613
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,500
So you pretend you do
not know me anymore.

614
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:16,500
So you can do your homework
yourself, because you're a crap.

615
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,510
And you do not know anything
about school lessons.

616
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,370
What did you say?

617
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:24,289
You know, I'm not
stupid, Spencer.

618
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:27,255
I want you to do one thing
only, I said do my homework

619
00:44:27,265 --> 00:44:30,240
so you can go in the team
and you screw it all up.

620
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:34,260
And I can not come back
again and it is your fault.

621
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:37,460
I should be kidding you now.

622
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:48,370
- I want to see you try it.
- What did you say?

623
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,379
Oh okay.

624
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,440
- I see what's going on here.
- Comrade friends.

625
00:44:54,450 --> 00:45:00,440
Do you think you're 6 feet 5 inches, 270
pounds of muscle all so I'm scared of you?

626
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:02,430
What do you think it is?

627
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:05,490
Maybe?

628
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:16,320
I said something to you. You're still the
annoying kid I've known since grade 7.

629
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,370
You never change.

630
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:21,400
Do not let your new
body make you arrogant.

631
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,450
Stupid.

632
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,520
No, no!

633
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:37,499
Spencer!

634
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,510
- You killed him!
- You're crazy!

635
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:43,260
Calm down, she'll come back.

636
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:05,280
- Do not call me stupid.
- Do not push me.

637
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:09,320
- Or what, Spencer?
- Or I'll push you back.

638
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,230
Did you just slap me?

639
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,379
You're hitting me?

640
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,440
Fridge, no.

641
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:31,280
I will beat you.

642
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:36,419
Enough!

643
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,250
We can not waste our lives.

644
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:43,410
We need each other,
like it or not.

645
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:46,490
We should do this together.

646
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:51,260
Can you say that again?

647
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:52,330
We should do this together?

648
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:57,320
But with the low
tone you just did.

649
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:00,400
That happens naturally.

650
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,260
What should we do here?

651
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,470
Look for the missing
folder section.

652
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,360
Can not we just ask?

653
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:38,279
No, I think we are around, see see
and most importantly, my friends ..

654
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,380
We just relax.

655
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:43,370
Fresh, fresh bread!

656
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:47,340
Does anyone have any money?
I'm really starving.

657
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,490
Get your fresh bread.

658
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:56,269
Friend, I think the game is
trying to tell us to stay ..

659
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:59,239
- We have to ..
- Stop doing that.

660
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,500
Oh my God is so good, I have
not eaten bread since 9 years.

661
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:05,360
- Are you serious?
- Do I look like kidding?

662
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,400
Let me try a bit.

663
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:13,380
Wait... what is this?

664
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,470
That is my favorite cake.

665
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:17,390
Cake?

666
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,480
But you said this was Bread.

667
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:21,470
I have not eaten until
I forget the taste.

668
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:24,259
I do not even ..

669
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,250
- Did something happen to me?
- No.

670
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:27,460
- Am I shaking?
- No.

671
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:30,450
- Am I weird?
- No.

672
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:33,400
- Am I still black?
- Yes.

673
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,420
Okay, okay buddy.

674
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,460
I'm fine, all is well.

675
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:43,460
No, no, no, I just found out I
like cake so I can not hold it.

676
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:46,280
Hey, all okay.

677
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,440
What's that?

678
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,450
As I said, you have
to be careful.

679
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:11,339
- When did you say that?
- Fresh bread.

680
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:14,400
Get out of here!

681
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:19,380
Dr. Bracer, thank God you're
here, Jumanji needs you.

682
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,370
Friend, have you heard this?

683
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:24,240
Ask him about missing part.

684
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,280
Oh right, hey, I'm Bethany.

685
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:34,290
I mean professor Sherly .. something, I'm
a map doctor and I have a missing map.

686
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:38,269
Dr. Bracer, thank God you're
here, Jumanji needs you.

687
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:39,480
Really?

688
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:43,340
We need to find
the missing part.

689
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:19,320
What you need is in the basket.

690
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:22,279
One wrong move, you die.

691
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:26,330
Mutual trust and never leave.

692
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:30,300
The missing part is not
what you think it is.

693
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,450
Oh my goodness.

694
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:35,470
- Good luck my hero, you might ..
- You might need it.

695
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:38,360
You've said a few times.

696
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:50,260
So, do you think there's a
snake in there or something?

697
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,270
Yes, it sounds quite
dangerous to me.

698
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,400
Why should it be
imprinted on me?

699
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:59,440
Since you're the hero, you
heard he said, now take it.

700
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,510
I do not want to do this!

701
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:17,430
Just do it!

702
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:40,390
Black Mamba!

703
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,410
It is a Black Mamba.

704
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:44,490
According to research the
poison is not directly killing.

705
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:50,480
But first give the sensation of numbness,
then fever then lose control of muscle.

706
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,330
How do I know all that?

707
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:53,500
- What should we do?
- You see what else in there?

708
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,420
I do not see anything, I
do not have enough time.

709
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,400
Okay, trust each other
and never blink.

710
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:02,360
I understand, I think this
is a staring contest.

711
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:03,430
- What?
- What are you talking about?

712
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:06,510
- Think! Never blink.
- Guys, I think he's right.

713
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:09,449
I think the snake should
not move too much.

714
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:13,310
I think someone should look at the
snake directly. And not blinking.

715
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:16,389
And then Spencer has to reach in
and take whatever's inside there.

716
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:18,390
- Why me again.
- Because it's your mission.

717
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:23,230
Okay, then who will look
at him and not blink?

718
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:27,339
I'm good at doing that.

719
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:29,500
This is your moment.

720
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,450
Now.

721
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:00,510
What should we do?

722
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:06,440
- You should give it that.
- What?

723
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:11,230
You must remove the poison and in the
blind spot to avoid being seen by it.

724
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:15,280
We must be careful because
he could suddenly move.

725
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:18,350
We have to break it.

726
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,290
I got this.

727
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,360
It's not a glaring contest.

728
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:32,250
Trust each other
and never blink.

729
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:36,230
You believe me and
I broke the snake.

730
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,500
I did it, I succeeded.

731
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:40,379
- Yes.
- Yeah you did it.

732
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:45,340
- Thanks.
- Oh yes, of course.

733
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:58,510
Hey buddy, this does
not look like a map.

734
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:01,470
The missing part
of the elephant?

735
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:05,299
Something is written
on this paper ..

736
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:09,260
When you see me,
start the ascent.

737
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:10,470
Start the ascent?

738
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,440
When you see an elephant?

739
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:17,310
Or elephant.

740
00:54:18,350 --> 00:54:24,350
Oh you have to find elephants I
think, for the next level of play.

741
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:30,480
Hey!

742
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,460
Run.

743
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,260
Watch out!

744
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:44,390
Stop! By Guavaberry.

745
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:47,400
Watch out! Watch out! Beware!

746
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:59,340
I have to warn you, I think
I have a strong fist.

747
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,370
Trim.

748
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:04,280
> Trim, block, block.

749
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,360
Uppercut.

750
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,460
Evade. Hit the head.

751
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:17,370
Kapow!

752
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:21,290
Evade. Block.

753
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:23,370
Flip.

754
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,460
Backward, fist.

755
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,280
Throw!

756
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:33,360
That's great.

757
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,460
Let's do this.

758
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,330
Do what?

759
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,460
Put it in my bag.

760
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:50,430
Evade. Hit the head.

761
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,310
Throw up!

762
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:20,230
Hello doctor.

763
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,430
Been a long time.

764
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:29,430
I'm sure you have
something of mine.

765
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:32,310
We just want to go home.

766
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:38,450
Come on, follow me fast.

767
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:40,420
Capture them.

768
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:47,380
Come on, come on, come!

769
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,370
Come!

770
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:56,330
Go down, let's hurry.

771
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:15,220
Find them!

772
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:17,410
Okay follow me, we'll be safe.

773
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:19,400
Let's go.

774
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:24,269
Oh my God, I'm so glad
you will not know.

775
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:25,480
- Really?
- Very strong.

776
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,390
I mean I saw you in the bazaar,
and I figured, not possible.

777
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:33,310
But I think, yes that's right,
is now close to the wall.

778
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:37,280
Oh my God.

779
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:40,440
Let's go ahead.

780
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:43,410
- Be careful.
- Who are you?

781
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:47,470
- Yeah what are you thinking about?
- Correct. Sorry okay.

782
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:49,320
Let me explain a little.

783
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:51,340
What are you waiting for the pilot?
Who flew the plane?

784
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:57,350
- Yes, it's me.
- Wait for you to be here too?

785
00:57:57,370 --> 00:58:00,500
- Step back 1 step and stop.
- Why?

786
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:09,440
Very scary.

787
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:12,380
That's terrible.

788
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,310
Wait.

789
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:24,390
Okay, let's take this board.

790
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:31,299
Follow me.

791
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,430
Be careful. That's a
terrible way to die.

792
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:40,340
That's right.

793
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,490
Come on.

794
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:50,240
I can, I can.

795
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:53,450
Cliffs, snakes, and more.

796
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,260
Okay.

797
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:10,360
Hello.

798
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,310
Yes.

799
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:20,240
Come on.

800
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:35,269
By the way, I'm Alex.

801
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:37,280
Spencer.

802
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:40,360
Martha, Fridge and Bethany.

803
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:41,490
Bethany.

804
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:44,479
- You're a girl?
- Women.

805
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,440
In real life you probably
will not listen to that.

806
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:58,270
They escaped, it looks
like they have help.

807
00:59:58,290 --> 00:59:59,470
Stupid ..

808
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:02,480
They must have fled
through the aisle.

809
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:05,380
Sorry boss.

810
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,300
That will not happen again.

811
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:13,300
I know.

812
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,270
We succeed.

813
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:30,370
Margarita, that's
one of my skills.

814
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:31,450
That and fly the plane.

815
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:35,340
Although I was shot by some
Orangutans and fighter jets.

816
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:38,420
So .. Maybe not so great right?

817
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:41,400
However, toast.

818
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:45,239
- Thanks.
- Of course.

819
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,500
- I never drank alcohol before.
- Me too.

820
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:51,410
- You know what? No problem!
- Cheers!

821
01:00:57,250 --> 01:01:00,310
- And I've had enough of that.
- This is good.

822
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,510
Can I ask again?

823
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,280
- Alex. From what is this candle?
- This?

824
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:07,240
Uh citronela, one of my
weaknesses is mosquito,

825
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:12,480
Which is a bit sad when you live
alone in the open in the forest.

826
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:15,310
You are single.

827
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:16,429
Who is this?

828
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:18,520
Who is Alan Parrish?

829
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:21,300
He's the person who
built this place.

830
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:23,290
Do you mean anyone else
is stuck here too?

831
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:26,330
Yes, I mean this is Alan Parrish's house.
I'm just riding.

832
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:31,300
So Alex told me how long
have you been in this game?

833
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:36,310
Uh hard to say. Time is not fun here.
But a few months I think.

834
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,340
- A few months?
- What?

835
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,855
Yes I do not have any
means of transportation.

836
01:01:39,865 --> 01:01:42,370
Transportation? What's that?

837
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:44,380
Next level.

838
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,350
The first time I had a
balloon fly and leave.

839
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:50,520
Then, the whole plane and so on.

840
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:54,469
And when I stay has 1 more life.

841
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:56,490
I realize I'm in trouble.

842
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:59,479
And I will not get
out of here alone.

843
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:02,390
If there is something that is
eyeing me, I can not handle it.

844
01:02:02,410 --> 01:02:04,460
You can not kill Black
Mom with a margarita.

845
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,349
Yes you can.

846
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:09,340
You need an animal
expert for that.

847
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:12,500
Alex, we can help each other.

848
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:17,310
You've been here a long time, and
among us we have a lot of power.

849
01:02:17,330 --> 01:02:21,310
Yes, that's right.

850
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:26,460
I do not know bung, if I
die once more, I lose.

851
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:31,410
It really scares me to even
think back to that transport.

852
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,379
I do not want to die in Jumanji.

853
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:36,279
We just need to stay together.

854
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:39,340
We do that and we can
win, I know that.

855
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:42,330
Oh my God.

856
01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:43,449
You are our missing part.

857
01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:45,500
You are the person
we need to find.

858
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:50,389
This does not make sense, we go to the
bazaar and find the missing pieces?

859
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:53,230
It's not an elephant.

860
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:57,460
- That's me.
- Yes.

861
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:01,390
Good.

862
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:04,310
- Let's do this.
- Yes.

863
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:08,430
Hey you gonna drink
that margarita again?

864
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:12,280
This is a nice margarita.

865
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:20,420
That's it.

866
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:22,370
Transportation place.

867
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:24,380
There is also a vehicle there.

868
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:29,330
We have to pick it up, cross the
valley, and go to the jaguar statue.

869
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,885
Okay I see the place of
transportation, I see

870
01:03:31,895 --> 01:03:34,290
the valley, but I can
not see the statue.

871
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:37,370
And that's weird, because it's the most
important thing in Jumanji, and that's big.

872
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,470
Like you.

873
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,330
You're drunk Fridge?

874
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:46,319
- No, I'm not drunk.
- He's drunk.

875
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,289
I only drank 3 margaritas.

876
01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:49,470
Well you're 3 times bigger
than your actual size.

877
01:03:49,490 --> 01:03:53,510
Whatever, whatever. - Okay Alex what
should we do? How do I get past the guard?

878
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,310
Last time I waited
for them to leave.

879
01:03:55,330 --> 01:03:58,240
- How long?
- 3 weeks.

880
01:03:58,260 --> 01:03:59,420
Oh we will die.

881
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:03,250
- Ok plan B.
- There might be another door there.

882
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:06,280
But we have to distract
the person first.

883
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:07,330
I know.

884
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:09,420
Distracting is what I do.

885
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,220
He's playing video
games, I'm distracting.

886
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,300
Bethany, I hate to
say this to you now.

887
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:18,300
But you now have no um ..
Opportunity for that.

888
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,410
Not me.

889
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:22,510
What?

890
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,470
- You have to go down and seduce them.
- No.

891
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:27,289
- And grab their attention as we enter.
- No!

892
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:31,240
I can not just go there and seduce
some strange warrior I do not know.

893
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:33,290
I know, but now we
have no other ideas.

894
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:36,490
I understand, but I
can not do that.

895
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:41,450
I can not talk to
men, I'm bad at it.

896
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:44,460
I'll give you some directives.

897
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:51,380
No sorry. We have to think of other
plans, no, I will not do that.

898
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:55,249
You just need to distract them
for a while until we get in.

899
01:04:55,250 --> 01:05:01,370
I can not Spencer, I'm not .. I'm
not a really beautiful lady.

900
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:05,260
What do you think?
You're really great.

901
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:10,230
You can do anything.

902
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:20,390
That's lovely Spencer, why do not
we make you a romantic dinner?

903
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:23,309
Or you can go from here.

904
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:26,440
Okay, show me how.

905
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:29,350
Class starts immediately.

906
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:41,380
Okay in persuasion issue, the
key is to get them to see you,

907
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,480
Without letting them know
if you know they saw you.

908
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:48,300
You're like, it's me. And when they start
talking to you, do it in 3 things.

909
01:05:48,310 --> 01:05:51,390
Decline, really interested,
or like a whore.

910
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:53,460
What you do depends on the
person you're dealing with.

911
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:56,309
This is like my dream
in my nightmare

912
01:05:56,310 --> 01:05:57,500
I will not take it personally.

913
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:02,319
Now, hair is everything.
Touch it, move it.

914
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:06,340
Play with it, move a lot.

915
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,289
Give me that beat.

916
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:10,259
Okay now keep it
behind your ears.

917
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:13,440
Now, lower your head,
open wide eyes.

918
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:15,299
- Now shine.
- Shine?

919
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:19,240
Like anime characters,
now shine.

920
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:26,430
You need practice.

921
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:34,280
You really think he likes me?

922
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:35,430
Why are we still
talking about this?

923
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:39,510
- I mean what if he tried to kiss me?
- You just have to kiss it back.

924
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:45,220
I .. What if he tried to kiss
me, like, without warning?

925
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:47,280
What are you talking about?
You never kissed someone?

926
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:49,269
Do not... You're gonna
say that to everyone?

927
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:51,480
- Hey buddy, I found the door on the edge.
- Okay I'll tell them.

928
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,330
No, no, do not tell them.

929
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:54,500
Okay let's start your way.

930
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:59,460
Slowly slowly, make it
like an elegant deer.

931
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:02,449
Or a horse, step high.
One foot on the other.

932
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:07,260
And forward, bomb, bomb, not so.

933
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:11,380
And do whatever you can to grab his
attention, something like this.

934
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:14,420
You need a very long
time to do this.

935
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:16,410
Good, that's better.

936
01:07:16,430 --> 01:07:18,450
Now smiling. You look scared.

937
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:20,450
- Oh you're so cute.
- You're so cute.

938
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:24,350
- Oh you're so cute.
- You're so cute.

939
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:26,460
- I think I already understand.
- You can.

940
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:29,230
Now keep your lips
slightly open like this.

941
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,469
No, not disgusting, just relax.

942
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:33,490
Now touch the top of your mouth
with your tongue like this.

943
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:38,410
- Like this?
- Like this.

944
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,230
Like this.

945
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:43,270
Like this?

946
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:45,450
I thought you were ready.

947
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:47,219
- Good.
- Okay.

948
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:50,489
Make love like your life is at stake.
Because it's true.

949
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:54,350
Okay that's the door, we just
need something to cut the fence.

950
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:57,420
Okay, Fridge do you have something
for that in your backpack?

951
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,299
Yes, of course.

952
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:01,460
This .. I think I have ..

953
01:08:01,470 --> 01:08:03,439
Some iron cutters.

954
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,460
Do you think that's good
for this situation?

955
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:08,240
Perfect is actually.

956
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,510
This is called the power
of the dear backpack.

957
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:14,410
Hey guys, I think it will work.

958
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:15,470
I also think so.

959
01:08:15,490 --> 01:08:19,289
He's really great, and they do
not like meeting new people.

960
01:08:19,290 --> 01:08:24,490
Great? - Well not like Cindy Crawford,
but for Jumanji, she's great.

961
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,440
- Bombs?
- Cindy Crawford?

962
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:28,360
- That's what you think?
- I just said that.

963
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:31,360
I'm sure they'll love it.

964
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,500
Alex.

965
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:40,500
What do you think is this year?

966
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,360
- What do you mean?
- Oh no.

967
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:46,320
This is 1996.

968
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:51,270
You're Alex Rigg is not it?

969
01:08:51,290 --> 01:08:52,450
Yes, that's right.

970
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:54,370
What do you mean? Like
in that strange house?

971
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:59,290
Wait what are you talking about?
How do you know me?

972
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:04,269
- Alex, I do not know how to say this ..
- You were in this game for 20 years.

973
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:06,499
That may not be how
I would say it.

974
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:08,390
What?

975
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:10,420
No, you're kidding me right?

976
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:15,279
No, Alex Rigg, everybody
knows about you.

977
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,500
You're a lost child.

978
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,279
20 years ago.

979
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,280
20 years?

980
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:25,240
20 years old.

981
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:29,389
I do not even know how to say this but ..
Cindy Crawford is now 50 years old.

982
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:33,240
- But still sexy.
- Yes.

983
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:35,290
Yes ..

984
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:42,230
That's it.

985
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:50,510
Hey.

986
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,410
We will take you home.

987
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,450
Yes.

988
01:10:17,310 --> 01:10:19,360
What happened to the butt?

989
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:21,370
Bethany what did you tell her?

990
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:26,320
- Is he sprained or maybe ..
- He can do it, just wait.

991
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:32,380
Hello little girl.

992
01:10:32,490 --> 01:10:35,460
What are you doing here alone?

993
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:38,410
Hey you guys

994
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:40,450
I'm lost.

995
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:43,370
Can you help me?

996
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:48,340
Hello little girl.

997
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:51,410
What are you doing alone here?

998
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:56,390
You are very
interesting and funny.

999
01:10:56,410 --> 01:10:57,430
What does he do?

1000
01:10:57,450 --> 01:10:59,500
There's an insect in his hair?

1001
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,510
He forgot all his training.

1002
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,490
Let's go.

1003
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:10,220
Wait. I ..

1004
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:13,340
I need to tell you about
the book I'm reading.

1005
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,390
About microbiology.

1006
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:20,460
It's related to my
secret biology.

1007
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,379
Hello little girl.

1008
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:31,370
What are you doing here alone?

1009
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:39,250
You are a great woman.

1010
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:46,260
(MUSIK)

1011
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:52,430
Do you want to dance?

1012
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:22,320
Which one, which one?

1013
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:25,430
I hate this place.

1014
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:32,270
Oh, that's a weird dancing game.

1015
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,390
Alex, what do you think?
What's the plan?

1016
01:12:34,410 --> 01:12:36,379
- What?
- What do we take? Which one?

1017
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:38,460
I do not .. I do not know, okay?
I told you ..

1018
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:43,280
- We have to fly, right? Helicopter.
- I told you, I do not know.

1019
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,350
He kicked their butt.

1020
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:56,460
That's our friend.

1021
01:12:56,470 --> 01:13:00,230
Yes, great!

1022
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:09,470
He destroyed them.

1023
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,500
You're great, man!

1024
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:49,320
Hurray!

1025
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:54,340
Yes! Yes!

1026
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:57,290
You are my hero.

1027
01:13:57,460 --> 01:13:59,370
We have to go.

1028
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:01,299
You're great in a fight,
you're a great friend.

1029
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:02,310
- Oh my God.
- You did it!

1030
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:04,360
- I did it!
- Yes, give me a hug, mate.

1031
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:08,390
Good we are hugging here, and that
makes us stupid, they've come.

1032
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:10,350
The bike rider has
arrived, we have to go.

1033
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:12,370
See, plane, we have
to fly, buddy.

1034
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:15,390
No, I can not do that, okay.

1035
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:18,379
I told you I'm not
a great pilot.

1036
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:19,500
Maybe we should take
the school bus?

1037
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,489
What? We can not keep them
away from that school bus.

1038
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:25,319
You select the plane, maybe
we should use the helicopter.

1039
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:26,480
No, I can not do it. OK?

1040
01:14:26,490 --> 01:14:29,240
I do not want to die.

1041
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:31,350
I'm a little scared.

1042
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:34,450
Okay, I'll do it.

1043
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:39,490
How difficult to fly a helicopter, you
just press the button, it will spin ..

1044
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:42,300
Okay, then I'll move ..

1045
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:45,490
The lever, that's how
you back and forth.

1046
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:48,240
Once we air, we'll all be fine.

1047
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:52,360
I just .. I just need to go up,
because this has no ladder, so ..

1048
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:55,400
Let me see, you know what,
I'll go in, be careful ..

1049
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:57,389
- No, you're drunk.
- No.

1050
01:14:57,390 --> 01:15:00,480
Fridge, you're drunk.
Give me the key.

1051
01:15:00,490 --> 01:15:04,240
And Alex. Alex .. If I
can fight those guys...

1052
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:07,240
You can fly this helicopter.
I know you can do it.

1053
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:09,320
Come on.

1054
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:13,270
Alex.

1055
01:15:13,370 --> 01:15:15,400
This is where we need you.

1056
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:19,340
Remember the missing part.

1057
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:25,330
Seaplane McDonough,
report for assignment.

1058
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:27,440
Come on, guys.

1059
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,460
Wow!

1060
01:15:48,470 --> 01:15:51,260
Wow, wow.

1061
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,330
Oh!

1062
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,280
I'm stuck.

1063
01:15:59,281 --> 01:16:01,270
- The controller is broken!
- What's your makasud?

1064
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:02,310
Hold on!

1065
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,380
Ow!

1066
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:08,520
Hold on!

1067
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:15,230
Oh God, we're gonna die!
We're going to die!

1068
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:22,500
Oh God!

1069
01:16:22,510 --> 01:16:25,360
- This does not want to go up.
- What? What do you mean?

1070
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:27,320
- The blades are damaged.
- What?

1071
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:30,490
There should be a climb up
there and fix the propeller.

1072
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:33,420
That's what makes
it up and down.

1073
01:16:40,290 --> 01:16:41,450
Hey, guys.

1074
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:43,240
That can not be great.

1075
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:45,460
It sure is bad.

1076
01:16:52,370 --> 01:16:55,300
Albino rhino!

1077
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:02,409
They are rare animals, they
are big, white, and horrible.

1078
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:05,280
No.

1079
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:09,410
- They are getting closer.
- I'm getting a little conscious.

1080
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:12,340
- Up!
- I can not ride!

1081
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:15,420
I think I'm mostly drinking.

1082
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:21,259
Hey, guys, what are we gonna do?

1083
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:22,380
I will repair the helicopter.

1084
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,260
- Yes!
- Tell me what I should do.

1085
01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:27,380
You must connect the control
cable to its rotor,

1086
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:30,390
Control cable, phonograph record,
insert into rotor. - Wait, what?

1087
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:32,290
I'll be right back.

1088
01:17:32,310 --> 01:17:33,460
Hey, where are you going?

1089
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,500
Hang on!

1090
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:38,310
- Be careful!
- He did not hear you.

1091
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:44,450
I can fix this, I'll fix it,
it's just a helicopter.

1092
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:51,360
It's a record,
it's a controller.

1093
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:03,500
Spencer! Endure!

1094
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,440
Spencer!

1095
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:17,440
Quick!

1096
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:20,360
Quick!

1097
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:29,390
We're out of the way.

1098
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,430
Pull the lever!

1099
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:43,290
What? We made it, I
think we'll die.

1100
01:18:43,310 --> 01:18:45,470
Comrades!

1101
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,280
Yes!

1102
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:49,470
Oops.

1103
01:18:49,490 --> 01:18:51,480
What?

1104
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:54,370
I dropped the permissions.

1105
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:56,480
- What?
- You dropped the eyes?

1106
01:18:56,490 --> 01:18:59,390
I lean back, I think I'll
throw up, but it does not.

1107
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,210
And it fell out of my bag.

1108
01:19:01,230 --> 01:19:02,410
We need that gem!

1109
01:19:02,430 --> 01:19:03,410
I know.

1110
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:06,269
That's the crazy part,
because I know we need it.

1111
01:19:06,270 --> 01:19:08,290
No. We're in trouble.
We're in trouble.

1112
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:09,490
Alex, spin, we have to
go back and fetch it.

1113
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:11,269
Yes, spin around.

1114
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:16,270
Let's search it, everything open
your eyes, we work as a group.

1115
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:25,320
There! I see it.

1116
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:33,420
What are they doing?

1117
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:36,369
It looks like they're
protecting it or something.

1118
01:19:36,370 --> 01:19:37,490
Okay, how are we
going to do this?

1119
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,320
I do not know.

1120
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:42,310
You're gonna take it,
do not you, buddy?

1121
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:50,400
What do you need, boomerang, maybe
scissors, iron pipe, laces ..

1122
01:19:50,410 --> 01:19:53,500
I will help you, whatever you
need, I can get it for you, okay?

1123
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:56,270
You select it.

1124
01:19:56,290 --> 01:19:57,449
- What?
- I'm sorry fella.

1125
01:19:57,450 --> 01:19:59,510
Sorry for what?

1126
01:20:20,510 --> 01:20:23,240
Alex, get ready
to turn sideways!

1127
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:25,230
What?

1128
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:29,210
As I give the
signal, turn right.

1129
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:31,310
Now!

1130
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:34,470
Oh, yes.

1131
01:20:34,490 --> 01:20:38,390
You pushed me out of the
helicopter, bastard!

1132
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:43,250
Wow.

1133
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:47,290
- You know, you're amazing.
- You're a great pilot, Alex.

1134
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:49,500
And you're also
Spencer, you're great.

1135
01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:53,360
- Oh, thanks. But he is ..
- No, no, no. You ..

1136
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:59,410
- You're doing great.
- Sorry Sorry. I am the one who sacrificed.

1137
01:20:59,420 --> 01:21:02,510
You do not know what it's like
to be on the rhino's side.

1138
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:05,280
And you do not want to know.

1139
01:21:05,290 --> 01:21:09,310
I've seen a lot of things.
I immediately felt it.

1140
01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:13,380
Things that can never be
erased from my memory.

1141
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:18,360
Oh, that's fun for you. Please laugh.
Come on.

1142
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:23,350
Comrades, I have been trying for 20
years to cross this limit, okay?

1143
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:26,370
Do you realize how big this is?

1144
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:32,370
- What's happening.
- No!

1145
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:33,330
No, no, no.

1146
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:35,380
- Geez, no.
- Alex.

1147
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:37,370
- Alex. No.
- Alex.

1148
01:21:37,390 --> 01:21:40,380
Alex, look at me. See me.

1149
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:41,400
He's dying.

1150
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:43,450
No, we can not let him die.
We're very close.

1151
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:45,380
Does anyone know how to do
artificial respiration?

1152
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:48,260
Yes, start by pressing the chest 3
times, and breathe through the mouth.

1153
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:50,510
One, two, three.

1154
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:51,470
How do you do this?

1155
01:21:51,471 --> 01:21:55,326
Okay, push his nose,
open his mouth, hold his

1156
01:21:55,336 --> 01:21:59,200
neck, one breath, two
breaths, and repeat.

1157
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:09,250
Come on Alex.

1158
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:14,310
Bethany, stop. Your tone.

1159
01:22:15,260 --> 01:22:18,250
Looks like you gave your life.

1160
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:21,290
I'm okay with that.

1161
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:22,480
What if you need to go home.

1162
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:25,490
I want Alex to go home too.

1163
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:48,470
What's happening?

1164
01:22:48,490 --> 01:22:52,329
Alex. Bethany gives
you one life.

1165
01:22:52,330 --> 01:22:53,390
Bethany are you okay?

1166
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:54,510
I think so.

1167
01:22:54,530 --> 01:22:56,410
Bethany is that correct?

1168
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:58,420
You gave me one of your lives?

1169
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:01,269
I mean yes of course.

1170
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:03,330
Thanks.

1171
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:13,400
Wow, what do you guys see?

1172
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:16,320
You have a problem.

1173
01:23:18,290 --> 01:23:21,450
Dear God, this thing is crazy!

1174
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:38,370
20 years old, huh?

1175
01:23:38,510 --> 01:23:41,410
Yes. I think so.

1176
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:49,319
You know, I keep thinking
of my poor parents.

1177
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:51,300
What they experience.

1178
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:57,230
And why, because I'm hiding in my
hideout, too afraid to finish the game.

1179
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:01,359
Sorry.

1180
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:04,360
I do not want to tell
you this, I just ..

1181
01:24:04,370 --> 01:24:06,250
You are very easy to talk to.

1182
01:24:06,270 --> 01:24:07,350
You know, I understand.

1183
01:24:07,370 --> 01:24:11,360
I mean .. sometimes, it's
easy to focus on yourself

1184
01:24:11,370 --> 01:24:15,370
so you forget that other
people have problems too.

1185
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:18,510
That's very deep.

1186
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:25,220
Thanks. I feel since I lost my phone, my
other senses are getting more sensitive.

1187
01:24:25,390 --> 01:24:29,320
Does the phone have any other
meaning in the future?

1188
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:35,280
What about you, Alex?
What do you like.

1189
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:38,290
In the real world,
what do you like.

1190
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:44,330
I have a metal band. I'm
a drummer, like my dad.

1191
01:24:58,350 --> 01:25:00,320
Hey.

1192
01:25:01,490 --> 01:25:03,289
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

1193
01:25:03,290 --> 01:25:05,490
I .. I'm filling this out.

1194
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:08,400
- Cool.
- Yes.

1195
01:25:12,270 --> 01:25:14,460
I'm glad you're here, I ..

1196
01:25:15,470 --> 01:25:17,320
There's something I
want to say to you.

1197
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:18,310
Yes?

1198
01:25:18,311 --> 01:25:24,230
And I want to tell you now. Just
in case when we talk later ..

1199
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:26,440
I no longer dare.

1200
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:30,370
I like you, Martha.

1201
01:25:30,390 --> 01:25:34,440
I like, I have a crush on you.

1202
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:37,470
Like very crush on you.

1203
01:25:37,490 --> 01:25:38,430
What?

1204
01:25:38,431 --> 01:25:40,310
Really.

1205
01:25:40,330 --> 01:25:45,450
And I've fancied since grade 7.

1206
01:25:45,470 --> 01:25:48,230
Really?

1207
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:52,270
Wow, I think this never
happened before.

1208
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:57,460
What do you mean? - I mean is .. no one
likes me, I can not believe I did this.

1209
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:01,350
I .. I never told anyone
about my feelings.

1210
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:05,450
I also have a crush
on you, Spencer.

1211
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:07,440
- Really?
- Yes.

1212
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:12,510
Yes! You're smart and
kind, and sweet.

1213
01:26:12,530 --> 01:26:16,300
Yes. I really fancy you.

1214
01:26:17,330 --> 01:26:22,450
Wait. You're sure this is
not because of... all this?

1215
01:26:22,470 --> 01:26:26,239
What? God, no. No,
that's not my type.

1216
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:27,390
I like the nerds.

1217
01:26:27,410 --> 01:26:32,310
Really? I'm a nerd!

1218
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:54,499
- That .. You never ..
- I never, I never kissed anyone.

1219
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:57,320
- That's the first time. You ever?
- I have ever. No.

1220
01:26:57,340 --> 01:26:59,239
Okay. Nice. By Guavaberry.

1221
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:01,340
Not visible right.

1222
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:06,240
Oh, come on, hey!

1223
01:27:06,250 --> 01:27:09,330
I do not want to see that. I
do not want to, not today.

1224
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:13,440
When you here confess your
love, I found the path.

1225
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:14,510
Come on.

1226
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:17,290
Dear God.

1227
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:28,420
That's it.

1228
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:30,350
That's it.

1229
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:32,500
We'd better start the path.

1230
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:57,260
I think we should go
through this path.

1231
01:27:57,530 --> 01:27:59,230
No.

1232
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:01,350
Can not be this easy.

1233
01:28:01,370 --> 01:28:04,400
The Defender.

1234
01:28:05,410 --> 01:28:07,470
What does it mean?

1235
01:28:08,310 --> 01:28:11,300
Only 1 way to find out.

1236
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:16,410
Fridge. Give me the permission.

1237
01:28:18,350 --> 01:28:21,220
Spencer.

1238
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:31,230
Oh.

1239
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:37,450
Something will happen.

1240
01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:39,460
I do not like the drum.

1241
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,430
Hey, you can not
just walk there.

1242
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:44,390
No.

1243
01:28:44,410 --> 01:28:46,410
That's what this
game wants us to do.

1244
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:49,280
Follow the path.

1245
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:51,480
This is a trap.

1246
01:28:57,260 --> 01:29:03,260
You see the elephants
start climbing.

1247
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:09,290
I will go up to the tree.

1248
01:29:09,310 --> 01:29:10,469
- Tree?
- Yes.

1249
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:13,320
- Do you think that means?
- It's certain.

1250
01:29:13,340 --> 01:29:15,360
That's the way.

1251
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:18,249
This is the last
resort of the game.

1252
01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:22,210
And I'm sure this is
what Bravestone does.

1253
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:28,450
Did he just call himself
a third person?

1254
01:29:28,460 --> 01:29:32,450
Ehm .. I think the
fourth person.

1255
01:29:37,370 --> 01:29:40,339
Oh, how can he do that?

1256
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:42,400
Climbing is one
of its strengths.

1257
01:29:42,410 --> 01:29:44,520
Ah .. I understand.

1258
01:29:44,540 --> 01:29:47,510
That means he is slow.

1259
01:30:08,430 --> 01:30:10,350
- No!
- Gosh!

1260
01:30:10,370 --> 01:30:12,269
Spencer!

1261
01:30:12,270 --> 01:30:14,330
Spencer!

1262
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:16,460
Spencer!

1263
01:30:21,410 --> 01:30:23,430
God, he's met a panther.

1264
01:30:23,450 --> 01:30:25,410
No.

1265
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:31,480
That sound cat.

1266
01:30:51,510 --> 01:30:54,239
Spencer!

1267
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:55,470
Oh God, are you okay?

1268
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:57,460
Yes, I think so.

1269
01:30:57,480 --> 01:31:00,350
You still have that gem, right?

1270
01:31:00,450 --> 01:31:02,230
- Yes.
- Thank goodness.

1271
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:03,280
Hey, what happened?

1272
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:05,410
I do not want to talk about it.

1273
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:07,419
Okay, so we need a new plan.

1274
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:08,440
- Right.
- Yes.

1275
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:12,290
So is mine. Spencer,
you got an idea?

1276
01:31:13,330 --> 01:31:16,390
Can I talk to you for a while?

1277
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:18,490
Now?

1278
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,460
What's happening?

1279
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:24,490
I can not do this.

1280
01:31:24,510 --> 01:31:28,439
- What are you talking about?
- I can not... do this.

1281
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:31,309
Who do I lie to? I'm
not an adventurer.

1282
01:31:31,310 --> 01:31:34,260
- Actually I'm not brave.
- Spencer...

1283
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:36,270
I just saw you hanging
on a helicopter.

1284
01:31:36,290 --> 01:31:39,440
It's easy to be brave if
you have a spare life.

1285
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:44,520
Much more difficult if
you only have one life.

1286
01:31:45,390 --> 01:31:49,330
We... we have only
one life, dude.

1287
01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:54,369
Okay, that's... that's all we get.
It's been like that before.

1288
01:31:54,370 --> 01:31:57,239
The question is how
we will live it.

1289
01:31:57,240 --> 01:32:01,200
Depending on you you want
to be what kind of guy.

1290
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:04,300
Did I just say some...

1291
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:06,500
Gosh, this game is a hazard,
I have to get out of here.

1292
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:10,510
Listen, we can do this, man.

1293
01:32:11,390 --> 01:32:14,250
We can do this together.

1294
01:32:16,430 --> 01:32:17,480
Together.

1295
01:32:17,490 --> 01:32:20,220
Together.

1296
01:32:21,460 --> 01:32:24,370
A good friend for adventurous.

1297
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:29,290
Okay.

1298
01:32:29,470 --> 01:32:30,440
Okay.

1299
01:32:30,441 --> 01:32:32,300
I did not know you
would be okay or not.

1300
01:32:32,310 --> 01:32:34,460
But all I know is football.

1301
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:37,390
If the line means something...

1302
01:32:37,410 --> 01:32:38,490
they are the defenders.

1303
01:32:38,510 --> 01:32:41,279
Which means that
we have to break.

1304
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,280
Everything...

1305
01:32:45,350 --> 01:32:46,340
We need to go.

1306
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:49,420
Okay, here's what we'll do.

1307
01:32:51,490 --> 01:32:53,510
We will play whatever
it is called.

1308
01:32:53,530 --> 01:32:56,360
To double the chance of winning.

1309
01:32:56,370 --> 01:32:59,269
Betty, you're on the left.

1310
01:32:59,270 --> 01:33:01,239
I'm on the right.

1311
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:04,250
Alex, you will venture deep
into the middle of the forest.

1312
01:33:04,270 --> 01:33:05,240
I'm leaving with Spencer.

1313
01:33:05,241 --> 01:33:08,370
No. There's something
else she should do.

1314
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:22,290
Are you ready to dance?

1315
01:33:37,510 --> 01:33:40,270
Hey! Over here!

1316
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:42,370
Let's get me!

1317
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:22,450
- Thanks.
- Of course.

1318
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:27,220
Go to its center. Hurry!

1319
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:59,260
Oh, dude.

1320
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:02,260
Okay, it's in action.

1321
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:04,220
Stop!

1322
01:36:08,390 --> 01:36:11,260
Are these elephants and mice?

1323
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:15,340
How are you, Mouse Finbar.

1324
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:22,460
Animal observer. Observer of
animals and men's backpack.

1325
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:42,520
Give me permission,

1326
01:36:42,530 --> 01:36:45,490
or your friend is dead.

1327
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:48,420
- Do not give it to him.
- Shut up!

1328
01:36:48,430 --> 01:36:50,420
Stop!

1329
01:36:54,540 --> 01:36:58,230
Take me instead, okay?

1330
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:08,510
Give me permission.

1331
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:10,470
I can not do that.

1332
01:37:10,490 --> 01:37:12,430
5...

1333
01:37:12,450 --> 01:37:14,389
- 4...
- I can not give you the wishes.

1334
01:37:14,390 --> 01:37:15,360
3...

1335
01:37:15,361 --> 01:37:16,370
- Spencer.
- 2...

1336
01:37:16,390 --> 01:37:18,490
Because I do not have it.

1337
01:37:26,470 --> 01:37:30,300
Animal observer, shit.

1338
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:42,380
Oh, no, no!

1339
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:56,390
Elephant.

1340
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,460
Start climbing.

1341
01:38:02,470 --> 01:38:04,350
Climb to it, and I'll get
the permission for you.

1342
01:38:04,370 --> 01:38:06,430
- Martha.
- Believe me, I'll get it for you.

1343
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:08,470
- Okay.
- Now.

1344
01:38:14,450 --> 01:38:17,280
Come on, Martha!

1345
01:39:25,450 --> 01:39:28,360
I'll take that.

1346
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:42,330
The game is over.

1347
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:54,370
I do not think so.

1348
01:39:58,490 --> 01:40:01,350
That's why I'm going to do this.

1349
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:32,420
Oh, Spencer.

1350
01:40:41,330 --> 01:40:43,300
No.

1351
01:40:53,510 --> 01:40:54,460
- Good!
- Wow!

1352
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,410
Okay!

1353
01:41:08,490 --> 01:41:10,310
Call his name!

1354
01:41:10,330 --> 01:41:11,290
Call his name!

1355
01:41:11,291 --> 01:41:13,210
Call his name, all!

1356
01:41:13,230 --> 01:41:19,330
Jumanji!

1357
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:00,420
- I think we made it.
- I think we won.

1358
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:03,230
I think we beat it.

1359
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:05,260
Friends, it's Nigel.

1360
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:07,250
Nigel.

1361
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:17,270
Excellent, trapped adventurer.

1362
01:42:17,290 --> 01:42:18,450
You removed the curse.

1363
01:42:18,460 --> 01:42:20,480
The entire population
of Jumanji thanked you.

1364
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:22,329
Your task here is done.

1365
01:42:22,330 --> 01:42:25,350
So unfortunately, this is
where we will split up.

1366
01:42:25,370 --> 01:42:26,490
Seaplane McDonough.

1367
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:29,470
I'll shake your hand.

1368
01:42:35,510 --> 01:42:37,480
Alex...

1369
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:45,280
Please Professor Oberon.

1370
01:42:50,330 --> 01:42:52,350
Let's do this.

1371
01:42:58,430 --> 01:43:02,370
- I will miss you very much...
- Hurry me out of here.

1372
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:12,440
See you, Ruby Roundhouse.

1373
01:43:13,250 --> 01:43:14,400
Wait.

1374
01:43:14,420 --> 01:43:17,280
Why should we go back?

1375
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:20,250
I just...

1376
01:43:20,490 --> 01:43:23,310
I like to be like this.

1377
01:43:23,330 --> 01:43:25,410
Along with you.

1378
01:43:25,430 --> 01:43:28,490
Then... let's keep it this way.

1379
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:31,260
Everyday.

1380
01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:34,430
Let's go home.

1381
01:43:51,450 --> 01:43:54,350
Doctor Bravestone...

1382
01:44:05,300 --> 01:44:07,250
Nigel...

1383
01:44:07,270 --> 01:44:09,420
I'm ready to go home.

1384
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:12,310
See you, my dear friend.

1385
01:44:16,410 --> 01:44:19,280
Bye, Bravestone.

1386
01:44:49,310 --> 01:44:52,340
- Gosh...
- Good, good, good...

1387
01:44:52,350 --> 01:44:53,360
I'm back, man!

1388
01:44:53,380 --> 01:44:57,249
I will never complain about my
body again forever. I'm grateful.

1389
01:44:57,250 --> 01:44:59,410
I miss you.

1390
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:07,330
Where is Alex?

1391
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:30,510
Hey, see...

1392
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:36,320
Are you afraid?

1393
01:45:39,460 --> 01:45:40,450
What do you think...

1394
01:45:40,460 --> 01:45:44,330
That means... it's possible...

1395
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:08,410
Alex?

1396
01:46:08,420 --> 01:46:10,320
Hey, Daddy, can you
come here and help me?

1397
01:46:10,330 --> 01:46:12,320
Yes.

1398
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:23,290
Hey, dad, can you
give me a minute?

1399
01:46:23,310 --> 01:46:25,470
- Oh yes, of course.
- I'll be right back.

1400
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:42,250
Bethany?

1401
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:44,480
Spencer?

1402
01:46:44,490 --> 01:46:46,480
Yeah.

1403
01:46:47,260 --> 01:46:49,420
Ruby Roundhouse?

1404
01:46:52,330 --> 01:46:55,270
And that would make you Fridge.

1405
01:46:58,340 --> 01:47:02,370
I'm surprised to see you guys.
All of you.

1406
01:47:03,350 --> 01:47:04,430
Then you get back.

1407
01:47:04,450 --> 01:47:05,460
Yes, that's right.

1408
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:09,380
This makes me startled,
when I see it, so...

1409
01:47:10,250 --> 01:47:13,420
Oh, yes, everything's
fine, buddy.

1410
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:18,380
Now you're an adult.

1411
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:20,329
You have a baby.

1412
01:47:20,330 --> 01:47:22,240
Yes, that's right.

1413
01:47:22,260 --> 01:47:23,420
This is Andy.

1414
01:47:23,430 --> 01:47:29,370
And my daughter's name... my
daughter's name is... Bethany.

1415
01:47:31,270 --> 01:47:34,370
We renamed it the name of a
woman who saved my life.

1416
01:47:40,380 --> 01:47:43,220
This makes me happy.

1417
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:04,220
Yo.

1418
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:05,500
Yo.

1419
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:22,310
Impressive.
