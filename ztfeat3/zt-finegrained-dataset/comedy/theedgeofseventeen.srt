1
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,188
Look, I don't want to take up
a ton of your time,

2
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,192
but I'm gonna kill myself.

3
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,856
I just thought that
someone should know.

4
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,976
I don't really
know how this works.

5
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,198
I'm probably gonna jump off an
overpass in front of a semi, so...

6
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,679
Or a U-Haul maybe,
just not a bus.

7
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,376
I'm not gonna be a dick
and make people watch.

8
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,549
But it has to be big.

9
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,836
It's got to be so big that it just...

10
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,871
Done. Kills me. Lights out.

11
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,837
'Cause if it just
maims me, and I'm like...

12
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,216
Well, then how's
that good for anyone?

13
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,736
Then I got to find
a nurse to smother me.

14
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,433
How am I gonna get
across smothering if I'm...

15
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,776
We don't need to get caught up
in the minutiae.

16
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,076
I just thought that an adult,
so, you, should know.

17
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,830
Wow. This is, uh,

18
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,670
a lot to take in,
Nadine. I...

19
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,758
I wish I knew what to say.

20
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,996
Well, I was actually just drafting
my own suicide note. Just now.

21
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,553
"Dear everybody.

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,399
"As some of you know,

23
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,600
"I have 32 fleeting minutes of
happiness per school day during lunch,

24
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,908
"which has been eaten up,
again and again,

25
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,115
"by the same especially
badly dressed student.

26
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,517
"And I finally thought,
'You know what?

27
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,799
"'I would rather have
the dark, empty nothingness.'

28
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,148
"I really would.

29
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,719
"It sounds

30
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,828
"relaxing.

31
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,109
"Have a nice life
without me, fuckers."

32
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,709
You are so gonna get fired
when I actually do it.

33
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,155
Well, not for sure,
but I can dream.

34
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,958
Let me start
from the beginning.

35
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,319
Around second grade,
I had a realization.

36
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,034
There are two types of
people in this world.

37
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,670
The people who radiate confidence
and naturally excel at life.

38
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,478
Yes! Yes!

39
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,632
And the people who hope all those
people die in a big explosion.

40
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,195
All right,
knock 'em dead, kiddo.

41
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,870
My brother, Darian,
was a winner from day one

42
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,439
and had about a million fans.

43
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,754
Bye.

44
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,159
His biggest one?

45
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,468
My mother.

46
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,590
Bye, sweetheart.

47
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,432
Look,
check it out. I won.

48
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,353
Okay, boss-lady.

49
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,549
See you tonight.

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,513
Nadine.

51
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,919
We're not doing this again.

52
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,594
You promised.
Now, get out of the car.

53
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,318
Well, that's it.

54
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,869
You could say my mother and
I weren't exactly peas in a pod.

55
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,877
And the only one who could
handle either of us was Dad.

56
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,195
I hate you.

57
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,275
Hey, hey,
hey, hey.

58
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,193
Dad had
a nearly impossible task.

59
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,191
Having to manage us both.

60
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,593
All right, now.

61
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,478
I know kids can be mean.

62
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,357
But if you get a chance,

63
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,071
fart into their backpacks.

64
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,118
I wish you were small.

65
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,108
Then I'd at least have
one person to have lunch with.

66
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,592
Instead, the most attention I got
at school was from these three.

67
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,029
Nobody likes you.

68
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,910
You suck and you're gonna get AIDS.

69
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,478
Over here. Come on!

70
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,711
My childhood had
become a raging dumpster fire,

71
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,756
and I couldn't
take one more second

72
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,871
of this intolerable,
unlivable nightmare of a...

73
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,279
Excuse me.

74
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,835
And then, out of the
clear blue, an angel appeared.

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,399
Can you move, please?

76
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,078
She was dressed like
a small elderly gentleman.

77
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,752
And her breath
smelled of SweeTARTS.

78
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,239
You want to hold him?

79
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,955
But don't squash him.

80
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,475
Hi, guy.

81
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,754
If you want, you could be
his other mom with me.

82
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,360
Really?

83
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,232
I'm gonna be your other mom
and take such

84
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,833
good care of you.

85
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,472
I accidentally suffocated him
two hours later in my pencil box.

86
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,198
But I had finally
made my first friend.

87
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,753
We told each other things we
never thought we'd say out loud.

88
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,913
Once, my grandpa's pajama flap
accidentally came open,

89
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,594
and I saw his wiener
and got real sad.

90
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,910
My mom has to take medicine,

91
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,560
or she'll get upset
and buy too much at the mall.

92
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,752
It's true.

93
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,816
It turned out Krista's
life wasn't perfect either.

94
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,512
Why,
this pudding is delicious!

95
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,955
I'm walking away.

96
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,075
What am I,
your mother?

97
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,176
Am I supposed
to babysit you?

98
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,430
But we got
each other through.

99
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,158
We could play with this.

100
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,879
We could play with Mr. Penguin.
Hee-hee.

101
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,272
For the next
few years,

102
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,555
everything was magic.

103
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,955
And then

104
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,349
some extremely
fucked-up shit happened.

105
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,917
Oh, my God.

106
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,914
I knew it.

107
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,469
It's really just the hair.

108
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,074
It's not that bad.
You can just grow it out.

109
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,039
Are you even up there?

110
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,037
Hey, move. I got to pee.

111
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,112
Darian, meanwhile,
just got better looking.

112
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,593
And that asshole knew it.

113
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,994
That night, I picked up some
cheeseburgers with my dad.

114
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,536
What do I have
that's any good?

115
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,896
T ell me that.
What have I ever had?

116
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,955
Hey, you have a lot.

117
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,072
You have love.
You have my love.

118
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,391
Very soon you're
gonna have cheeseburgers.

119
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,835
Oh, look!

120
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,953
Did I not tell you?
Cheeseburgers.

121
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,308
Mmm.

122
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,191
You want a fry?
Oh, yeah.

123
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,595
I told you dirty jokes...

124
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,918
Whoa, hey.
That was Billy Joel.

125
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,475
You don't turn
past Billy Joel.

126
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,753
I might
be as crazy as you say

127
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,797
If I'm crazy, then it's true

128
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,718
That it's all because of you
Mmm...

129
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,671
And you wouldn't
want me any other way

130
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,792
You may be right

131
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,230
I may be crazy

132
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,754
Dad?

133
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,235
Dad, are you okay?

134
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,635
Dad!

135
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,274
It's too late to fight

136
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,954
Dad?

137
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,549
Dad.

138
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,150
But you may be right

139
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,390
I'm not gonna
depress you with the details,

140
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,555
so let's just say the next few
years were complete shit.

141
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,236
Oh, God.

142
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,597
Well, except for one part.

143
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,954
I had Krista.

144
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,033
This was last Friday.

145
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,872
Look at me.
I was in a good mood.

146
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,229
I love spoilers.

147
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,320
No.

148
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,436
Yes, I do. That means
I don't have to watch it.

149
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,193
Then I can just know
and move on with my life.

150
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,349
I'll give you a hint.

151
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,190
I knew it! I knew it.
They get married, yes!

152
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,149
Whoa!

153
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,996
God, juvy made him so hot.

154
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,351
Oh, God, I forgot to
tell you something.

155
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,839
He works at Petland now.

156
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,708
I should go in there
and be like,

157
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,096
"Excuse me,
where are the Betta fish?

158
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,873
"And also, could you put
your penis inside me?"

159
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,837
Not you.
God.

160
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,273
What if you
actually did that?

161
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,079
What if you actually lost
your virginity in a Petland?

162
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,832
I think it'd be
kind of nice.

163
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,480
All the little tropical fish watching.
It'd be kind of spiritual.

164
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,440
Oh, my God.

165
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,040
Could you please look at that
stupid shirt my brother's wearing?

166
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,394
Oh, you can
see his nipples.

167
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,994
How does he not realize
that all that does is scream,

168
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,355
"I have a body complex
worse than a girl's"?

169
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,158
How much does he
even work out now?

170
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,753
It's OCD.

171
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,216
You should've seen him.
He had a conniption

172
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,037
'cause my mom won't buy
him creatine anymore.

173
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,951
Since it fucks up
your kidneys.

174
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,518
I was like,
"I know, Darian. I know.

175
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,696
"What, does Mom expect,
you to win

176
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,836
"people over with your
personality?"

177
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,199
Hey. So, just a heads up,

178
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,716
but yesterday, when you were giving
your lecture, you were like,

179
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,673
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, then the
North seceded from the Union,"

180
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,591
you meant to say
the South seceded.

181
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,280
You accidentally
said the exact opposite.

182
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,456
I didn't want to
raise my hand and be all,

183
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,596
"Excuse me. These kids
are pretty confusable."

184
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,272
Just thought maybe
you'd want to know.

185
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,471
Oh, hey.
Yeah?

186
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,593
Great catch.
Yeah.

187
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,639
Now, I know that it was a long lecture,
and you probably don't recall,

188
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,158
but, uh, was there any point during
it where you thought to yourself,

189
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,556
"Gosh, I wonder what it's like
to actually have a life"?

190
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,478
No.

191
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,840
No,
I was too concentrated on how

192
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,336
you were effin'
the whole thing up, so...

193
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,759
Well, I understand that,

194
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,752
but just know that I haven't
given up hope. Not yet.

195
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,389
Okay.

196
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,229
Hey.

197
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,480
Hey.

198
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,114
I like your sweatshirt today.

199
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,474
It's nice.

200
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,629
Thank you.

201
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,109
Where'd you get it?

202
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,516
The sweater.
Sweatshirt.

203
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,829
I...

204
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,276
I don't know.
I don't remember.

205
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,718
Kewlio.

206
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,952
Yup.
Yeah.

207
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,951
Don't know where
that came from. What?

208
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,235
What's his name?
Erwin Kim.

209
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,320
I don't know him.

210
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,868
Well, you would freaking love him.
He's adorable.

211
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,760
So, you gonna
hook up with him?

212
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,955
No, not like that.

213
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,080
Like pathetic adorable.

214
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,799
Like I want to carry him
around in a BabyBjörn.

215
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,469
Oh. Oh, good, good,
good, good!

216
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,949
I caught you.
I'm so glad. Oh!

217
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,919
Do you like this dress?

218
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,033
Does it look bad? I just
think it looks kind of bad.

219
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,873
You know, it's kind of poofy,
and I don't know.

220
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,473
Do my arms look bad?

221
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,315
No.

222
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,736
Yeah, you don't
sound very believable,

223
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,200
and you're making me
nervous, Nadine.

224
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,192
Your upper arms
are breathtaking.

225
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,153
Where are you going?
Well,

226
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,348
it's last minute,
but Brent called me.

227
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,759
The dentist one.

228
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,037
And he asked if I wanted to go
to Manzanita for the weekend,

229
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,513
and I thought,
"You know what?

230
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,273
"I deserve to be a little
selfish once in a while, so..."

231
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,109
Is that one of
the, uh, match.com guys?

232
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Yeah.

233
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,430
You should go for
as long as you want.

234
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,349
Very funny. I'm gonna be
back on Sunday. Okay?

235
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,237
Just in time
to surprise you.

236
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,360
Oh, I tried
to call Darian,

237
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,880
but he must be in
his AP study group.

238
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,439
I'll tell him.

239
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,639
Be good.

240
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,235
What? Huh?
Dibs. Dibs, dibs, dibs!

241
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,588
What are you even saying?

242
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,536
Oh. Mom's fucking a dentist
in Manzanita for two days,

243
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,959
so I call dibs on the house,
okay?

244
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
Ew.
Bye!

245
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,636
Dude, you are so sick
for saying it like that.

246
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,995
Mom's boobs are jangling
around a dentist's face.

247
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,120
See it, Darian.

248
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,873
See Mom's titties all up
in that dentist's face.

249
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
Ow!

250
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,875
Oh, my God, I love you.

251
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,190
I love those teeth
in your mouth.

252
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,955
That's your nose.
You just picked my nose.

253
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,518
No way. Mmm-mmm.
Do a gainer!

254
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,920
Where are you going?

255
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,439
Darian!

256
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,919
Darian!

257
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,190
You need to get all these
people out of the pool.

258
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,236
Excuse me,
all of you need to leave.

259
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,878
Bye-bye!

260
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,556
Hey,
no one's listening to you.

261
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,096
You said you weren't gonna
drink until after soccer.

262
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,076
You failed, failure!

263
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,674
Dude, I'm not drinking.
It's orange juice, genius.

264
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,795
How drunk is she?

265
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,359
I've had one drink, okay?

266
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,193
Now, you get your
friends out of the pool.

267
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,920
No.

268
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,956
Okay, then.
I'm gonna call the cops.

269
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,508
Okay, yup, you're cut off now.
We're going upstairs.

270
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,840
Excuse me,
I'm calling the cops.

271
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,677
Hey, you're retarded.

272
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,360
Beep-beep!
Beep! Beep! Beep!

273
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,994
I'm still dialing.
Hello, operator?

274
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,071
Yeah, um,
can you please help me?

275
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,160
Oh, my God.

276
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,153
My brother's hurting me
in my no-no hole!

277
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,436
Why am I so grotesque?

278
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,430
How do you even like me?
What's wrong with you?

279
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,829
Stop.

280
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,718
I don't even like me.

281
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,829
I heard my voice in
a voice mail yesterday.

282
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,196
I was like, "How could anyone
stand listening to you?"

283
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,993
You're just drunk right now, okay?
I hate my face.

284
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,192
I hate the way it looks when
I talk or when I chew gum.

285
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,555
Don't ever let me
chew gum, okay?

286
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,949
Don't let me chew gum.

287
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,798
And then I had
the worst thought.

288
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,358
I got to spend the rest
of my life with myself.

289
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
Let's go to your room.

290
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,474
Don't you want to wake up
in your bed tomorrow morning?

291
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,039
Don't you want to do that?

292
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,395
You don't want to sleep here.
Come on, Nadine.

293
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,393
Hey, is there any
more aspirin anywhere?

294
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,152
Maybe. Try...
Try that thing over there.

295
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,913
Hey, no, you don't have to.

296
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,960
No, it's... It's cool.
It'll just go faster, so...

297
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,469
All right.

298
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,074
So, what happened?
Uh...

299
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,671
Somebody let Baxter in
and he pissed.

300
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,656
Hey, can you do me
another quick favor?

301
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,040
Can you grab me
those paper towels?

302
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,829
Cool, and just clean up
all this dog urine?

303
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,194
Yeah, right.

304
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,993
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

305
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,036
What the fuck!
Oh, oh! God. Can you...

306
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,838
Just get out.
Get out of my room, man!

307
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,956
Just stop looking, man!
Just get out!

308
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,317
I don't know, I don't know.
I don't...

309
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,675
I swear I don't even
know what happened.

310
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,433
I don't even know
how it happened.

311
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,760
It was...

312
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,875
I don't know.

313
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,555
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

314
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,873
Are you okay?

315
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,518
I'm just... Just thinking.

316
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,313
Okay, I'll see you later.

317
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,709
Nadine, you can't just leave
without saying anything.

318
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,074
Nadine.

319
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,880
Look, you're my best
friend and I love you.

320
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,473
It wasn't your fault.

321
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,157
You disgust me.

322
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,429
That's nice.

323
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,514
Go grow yourself
a wispy mustache, you pervert,

324
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,113
and stay away from
my friends, okay?

325
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,195
Did you just say
"friends" plural?

326
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,552
Your head is too
big for your body.

327
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,279
It makes you look ridiculous,
and you'll never be able to fix it.

328
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,680
Mr. Bruner.

329
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,677
I didn't have a chance to do the
homework last night because...

330
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,397
Well, I don't know if you know this,
but my dad passed away.

331
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,197
It's just been really
hard to do anything.

332
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,638
Date of passing?

333
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,838
Sorry? When, uh...
When did he die?

334
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,239
Um, 2011.

335
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,189
Ooh. Hmm.

336
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,471
Yeah, I have
a one-year expiration date

337
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,591
on freebies for
the dead and dying.

338
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,560
Are you serious?

339
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,096
There'll be
other opportunities.

340
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,715
Your grandparents
can't stick around forever.

341
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,357
Have a seat.

342
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,115
Okay, class,
the Young Mr. Lincoln.

343
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,029
Uh-huh.

344
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,357
Enjoy.

345
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,119
How was your weekend?

346
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,874
Hmm?

347
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,110
It was below average.

348
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,275
Yeah.

349
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,759
Okay.

350
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,269
How was your weekend?

351
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,035
Oh, I, uh...

352
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,560
I golfed.

353
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,155
You know, like, mini.
Like mini-golf.

354
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,696
Like...

355
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,676
I don't know why I did that.
I'll pick that up.

356
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,359
Um, but, yeah. Yeah.

357
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,278
Tim's Fun Park.
Yeah.

358
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,955
I love that place.

359
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,549
We should go sometime.

360
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,959
Yeah, we should.

361
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,917
But with,
like, a group of people.

362
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,276
Like, with several people.

363
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,109
Or just us.

364
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,238
Like, just-just-just us?
Yeah. You know.

365
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,151
I think we...
Yeah, or a group.

366
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,309
Yeah.
Yeah. A group.

367
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,896
I think that would be...
I think that would be great.

368
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,536
It would be so
much more fun, right? Yeah.

369
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,391
You know.
Yeah.

370
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,976
Hey, I'm gonna catch up
with you guys, all right?

371
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
All right, man.
See you later.

372
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,793
Hey.
Hi.

373
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,788
Look, I just...
I want to say that, uh,

374
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,909
you're my sister's friend,

375
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,036
and what happened
the other night, you know...

376
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,593
Yes, thank you. Thank you.
So weird.

377
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,999
Yeah, it was just...

378
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,230
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

379
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,673
It was all me, 'cause...

380
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
Uh...

381
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,952
It was, uh...
It was, uh...

382
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,439
Anyways...
Yeah.

383
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,192
Cool. I'll see you...

384
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,349
At the house or...

385
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,351
Around.
Cool.

386
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,549
Hey, um...

387
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,872
I had a really
good time with you.

388
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,759
Me, too.

389
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,352
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

390
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,755
I'm sorry.

391
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,560
One second.

392
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,673
It's cool.

393
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,394
Continue.

394
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,473
Okay, that was weird.
That was a weird thing to do.

395
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,518
Um...

396
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,277
What do you want me
to do, Nadine?

397
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,828
I want you to think about
how shitty this is for me.

398
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,389
I know.

399
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,838
What if I did this to you?

400
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,394
What if...

401
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,832
What if...
What if I liked your dad?

402
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,958
What if I gave
your dad a hand job?

403
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,270
Oh, Louis. Wow, you look so hot with that
belt phone of yours.

404
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
Wow.
Okay. Um...

405
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,120
Oh, Krista, you're home early!
Okay.

406
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,319
Why? Why? Why?
Why do you even like him?

407
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,628
I don't know.

408
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,997
Yes, you do. Yes, you do.

409
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,117
Is it a girl thing that, like,
you hooked up with him, so now

410
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,376
you're emotionally attached?
No.

411
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,595
Are you unconsciously
mad at me, maybe,

412
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,160
and this is like
some kind of revenge?

413
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,998
Are you unconsciously
mad at yourself,

414
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,838
and this is some
kind of self-punishment?

415
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,256
'Cause if that's what it is,
then we can work...

416
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,636
Will you stop talking!
Because you're driving me insane!

417
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,949
Please!

418
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,431
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

419
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,954
He invited me to
a party on Friday.

420
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,712
And I want you
to come with us.

421
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,153
Like you're gonna go with him,
and I'm gonna tag along.

422
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,511
I'm gonna have to
see if I'm around.

423
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,600
Yeah.

424
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,680
Okay.

425
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,755
Thank you for coming.

426
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,796
What? No, no,
I'm having a great time.

427
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,598
Oh, hey. Hey, look, maybe you
guys can fuck on the lawn later.

428
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,193
Please rise above yourself,
Nadine.

429
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,390
Please suck
several dicks, Darian.

430
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,230
Oh, hey. I want you to
meet some people.

431
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,120
What's up? This is Krista.

432
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,428
Hi!
Hi.

433
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,656
I'm Shannon. You were in my
chem class last year, right?

434
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,638
Yes! Yes.
Nice to officially meet you.

435
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,995
Oh, my God. I love
your outfit. It's so cute.

436
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,798
Oh!
Thank you very much.

437
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,320
I love the lace and the necklace.
Thank you.

438
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,478
Hey, do you want
to play, uh, beer pong?

439
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,393
Yes! I would love
to play beer pong.

440
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,914
I don't really know
a lot of people here.

441
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,508
That's totally fine.
Like, you'll meet people.

442
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,272
It'll be a great icebreaker.

443
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,400
Sounds good.

444
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,590
Hi! I think I'm gonna go play
beer pong with them.

445
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,914
Come on!

446
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,994
Yeah! New player!

447
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:23,517
Drink! Drink!
Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!

448
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,316
God, just don't be so weird.

449
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,960
God, why are you so awkward?

450
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,713
God. Just have a good time.

451
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,155
Just relax. Just relax.
Have a good time.

452
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,196
Go talk to people.

453
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,118
Okay. All right, great.
Yeah, perfect. I'll do that.

454
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,275
That's two cups!

455
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,788
I don't know how I did it!
That's two cups!

456
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,829
It's cool if I sit here?

457
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,880
Yeah.

458
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,918
You having fun?

459
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,839
Feeling pretty good.

460
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,872
I respect that.

461
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,159
Hey.

462
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,878
Aren't you
Darian Franklin's sister?

463
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,509
Yep.

464
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,194
Do you watch TBS ever?

465
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,916
Sometimes.
There's this old movie

466
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,096
that's always
playing on there.

467
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,519
It's got
Arnold Schwarzenegger

468
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,239
and the little bald guy
from It's Always Sunny?

469
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,878
Yeah, they play
twin brothers.

470
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,394
Only Arnold's all
tall and buff and hot.

471
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,736
Yeah, yeah, and the other guy's
like little and funny looking.

472
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,829
Yes!
God.

473
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,598
Twins!
Yes!

474
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,711
I love that movie!
Love that movie. It's so good.

475
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,149
You and your brother
kind of remind me of that.

476
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,469
God.

477
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,240
Hi.

478
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,839
I need you to come pick me up.

479
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,915
How was it?

480
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,837
Uh, it was probably one of
the worst nights of my life.

481
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,831
God. You wouldn't
believe the night I had.

482
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,397
Sorry I look like hell.

483
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,159
What happened?

484
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,591
So, the dentist?

485
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,197
I was home tonight, having
a relaxing glass of wine,

486
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,316
and I got an email

487
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,310
from his wife.

488
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,598
I was about to call Dr. Hill, hysterical,
but then I thought, "No, Mona.

489
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,108
"You're gonna do
this on your own.

490
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,111
"You've done everything
on your own since 2011.

491
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,760
"You're gonna do
this on your own, too."

492
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,873
God, I feel like
such a loser.

493
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,960
You're not a loser.

494
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,153
I feel like one.
You're not a loser, Mom.

495
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,233
You're attractive.
You're good at decorating.

496
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,472
You're very diligent
with your eyebrows.

497
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,776
Think about if it did work out,
"Hey, did you floss today?

498
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,758
"You know, gum disease
is a silent killer, Mona."

499
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,096
You know what I'm
gonna do tonight?

500
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,120
What?

501
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,240
I want to go home.

502
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,673
Fix my hair.

503
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,469
Put on a beautiful face of
makeup and the best dress I own.

504
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,950
Then take it all off
and go to sleep.

505
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,754
Fun.

506
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,237
"Hey, Nick. I sent you a
friend request a while ago.

507
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,231
"Maybe you just
skipped over it.

508
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,915
"Or sometimes there's a glitch where
Facebook doesn't send the email.

509
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,675
"So, I just thought that I'd

510
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,148
"inform you."

511
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,559
Oh, my God.

512
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,869
You are truly pathetic.

513
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,395
Hello.

514
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,994
Hey,
it's Nadine from history.

515
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,038
Um, what are you doing right now?
Uh... Oh, uh...

516
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,833
Hi, I'm, uh...

517
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,239
Hi.
I'm just, uh...

518
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,514
Hey.
Hi.

519
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,272
Hey. You all right?
Yeah, I'm good.

520
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,753
'Cause I'm good.
I mean, you good?

521
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,757
You all right? You cool?
You all right? Great.

522
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,353
Yeah.
What's up? Sorry, I keep...

523
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,496
How are you?
Are you good? You all right?

524
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,590
Hey, so Tim's Theme
Park's open late tonight.

525
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,035
Do you want to meet there?

526
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,956
So, how come they
canceled the party?

527
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,672
Oh. By "canceled,"
I more meant I left. Ah.

528
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,994
Gotcha.
Yeah.

529
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,832
Thanks for driving,
by the way.

530
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,440
I don't have
a license 'cause I'm like,

531
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,033
"Why not just have
people drive you?"

532
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,633
People make such
a big deal about

533
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,597
being able to do
things for themselves.

534
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,669
That was a joke.
I failed the test. Oh.

535
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,509
Hello.

536
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,835
You can get that.

537
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,598
Uh, no. It's cool.

538
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,595
Um, hey, look, there's no
line at the Ferris wheel.

539
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,176
So, tell me something
I don't know about you, Erwin.

540
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,394
I, uh...

541
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,708
What are your
hopes and dreams?

542
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,637
Take me on
a tour of your psyche.

543
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,834
Gee. I don't know. I guess I'm
just your average guy, I guess.

544
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,831
Right,
but if you had to expand

545
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,911
for the two minutes
that we're on the ride?

546
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,629
Right.

547
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,456
What are your parents like?
Oh. Well, my dad...

548
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,096
Actually, wait, wait, wait.
Let's see if I can guess.

549
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,976
I want to see if I'm psychic.
Okay, here it is. Sure. Okay.

550
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,416
Your mom gets on
you about your grades

551
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,680
and practicing
your instruments.

552
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,896
She makes
a great egg sandwich

553
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,070
after years of owning
a small restaurant downtown.

554
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,997
Your dad, quiet, gruff.

555
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,594
Never really says,
"I love you." Um...

556
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,150
But with his stoic presence,
I mean, you know he cares.

557
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,616
I'm really hoping
none of that was racist,

558
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,119
but now I'm thinking
all of it was.

559
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,590
No, no. Not racist at all, you know.
You're good. Yeah.

560
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,696
Whoa! What are you... Oh, my God.
Whoa, I'm sorry.

561
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,119
Was that bad timing?

562
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,376
'Cause I thought
it was good timing

563
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,856
'cause you're on
a Ferris wheel, you're upset.

564
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,016
Okay. I'm just trying
to comfort you.

565
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,696
That was weird?
We should probably get off.

566
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,597
We should get off.
Yeah, that was...

567
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,029
Hey! Excuse me, could we be let off?
Erwin. Erwin?

568
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,789
Can we please?
Can we stop the fucking ride?

569
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,393
Can we just stop it?

570
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,394
I'm sorry for... I didn't
mean to raise my voice.

571
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,550
Oh, my God, Erwin.

572
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,719
Wait, wait, wait! Wait!

573
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,880
Oh!

574
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,194
Okay.
What!

575
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,231
You got it! That was all you.
I got it.

576
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,231
We got it. We got it.

577
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,639
Holy crap.

578
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,994
Nobody saw that.

579
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,275
We're good.
We're out of here.

580
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,835
This has been
a really fun night.

581
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,196
I'm sorry if I flipped out on you
on the Ferris wheel earlier.

582
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,670
Oh. No, my timing
was just bizarre.

583
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,216
I'm going through
a lot of shit right now.

584
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,912
It's a long story.

585
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,070
I'm sorry you're
going through stuff.

586
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,432
You're a really
great guy, Erwin.

587
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,555
Aww.

588
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,517
No, I'm serious.

589
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,639
I look at you and I just
see this really, really,

590
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,432
really old man.

591
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,835
"Old"?
I'm complimenting you.

592
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:39,473
I just see this very kind,
very gentle, very wise old man.

593
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,998
In a convalescent home.

594
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,439
In a wheelchair.

595
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,672
Hmm.

596
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,795
Thank you.

597
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,800
Hi.

598
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,435
Hi.

599
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,475
I...

600
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,976
I know you're mad at me
because you think

601
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,958
that I ditched you to
play beer pong, and...

602
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,429
I never said I was mad.

603
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,868
Okay, well,
I know that you are, and...

604
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Nadine.

605
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,832
Would you like to know an observation
that I made this weekend?

606
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,159
Sure.

607
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,275
"Oh, my God, Shannon. Your outfit,
it's so cute! I love it!"

608
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,355
Yeah, okay.

609
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,038
And you tossed me aside?

610
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,196
The person who's had your
back since second grade.

611
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,736
Who's been with you
through everything.

612
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,216
You know what? Fine.
Yeah, that's what happened.

613
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,673
Because chances are,
those pricks,

614
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,296
they're not gonna
give a shit about you

615
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,118
when Darian drops your ass
for someone hotter.

616
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,039
You don't know anything,
Nadine.

617
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,478
Look, it's really shitty to hear.
I'm sorry. It's gonna happen.

618
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,357
No, I'm sorry,
it's not gonna happen.

619
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,793
Because your brother
just asked me

620
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,155
to be his girlfriend
and to prom in May.

621
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,673
No.
Yeah, he did.

622
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,830
He just asked me that.

623
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,271
You can't.
You can't have both.

624
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,590
It's me or him. Pick.

625
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,710
No, I'm...
No, I'm not gonna pick.

626
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,279
It's me or him.
Do you want him?

627
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,696
Nadine. Nadine...
Or do you want me?

628
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,416
This isn't a choice.
Why can't you just say me?

629
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,476
Him or me, now!
No, I'm not gonna pick!

630
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,391
You know what?
Then we're done.

631
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,229
We're done.

632
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,995
Fine.

633
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,953
Nadine.

634
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,109
Nadine.
Hmm.

635
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,394
Hey, wake up.

636
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,040
You had a brain operation.
It worked.

637
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,076
They made you
pleasant and agreeable.

638
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,118
Ah, just wishful daydreaming.

639
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,633
Hey, the bell rang.
Leave, please.

640
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,153
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, you know
what, just ignore her. She's...

641
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,793
I'll call you later.

642
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,199
Bye.

643
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,759
I don't want to hear about it.

644
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,353
Work it out
between yourselves.

645
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,310
In a couple weeks,
Dad'll be dead four years.

646
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,990
When I was on my way home today,
this memory came back to me.

647
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,919
It was that night,

648
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,717
after everything happened.

649
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,840
I got up to go to the
bathroom, and I saw you

650
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,836
crying so hard.

651
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,355
I mean, so hard your
pillow was just soaked.

652
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,431
That made me so sad.

653
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:15,632
I got up and I went in my room.
I got my pillow.

654
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,790
Took the wet one for myself.

655
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,632
I wish you loved me
that much.

656
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,639
Asshole.

657
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,233
No, no.

658
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,709
Hey, you're so messed up
for bringing up that story.

659
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,153
You're so messed up!

660
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,296
I mean,
do you even realize how sick

661
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,696
in the head you are
for bringing that up?

662
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,871
Oh, I'm sorry you feel guilty for never
caring about anyone but yourself.

663
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,200
Oh, yeah.
No, that's exactly it.

664
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,838
Face it, you're
obsessed with yourself.

665
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,069
Oh, my God.

666
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,879
Your report card on the refrigerator,
like you're five years old!

667
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,678
"Hey, everybody!
Hey, everybody, look!

668
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,796
"I pooped in the big potty!"

669
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,788
God, do you even know what it feels
like to love another human being?

670
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,150
Oh, man,
you are so dramatic.

671
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,871
Okay? Hey, life isn't fair sometimes,
Nadine, okay? Get over it!

672
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,896
I swear to God. I swear to God,
I'm gonna clock you!

673
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,069
Don't touch me, man.

674
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,435
Stop saying stuff like that!
Calm down already, man!

675
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,148
Stop it!

676
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,875
What is the matter with you?

677
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,632
I...

678
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,216
I know what this is about.
No, you don't.

679
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,710
Yes, I do. Krista
and Darian are a thing.

680
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,920
You guys think I don't know
things, but I know things.

681
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,268
I'm leaving.
No, you're not.

682
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,634
Where are you going?
I'm taking a therapeutic walk.

683
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,159
Get back here!

684
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,750
Oh, God. Darian!

685
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,478
Just don't
worry about it.

686
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,792
Can I just
ask you a question?

687
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,756
Is it worth turning the house
into a war zone?

688
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,958
What am I
supposed to say to that?

689
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,911
I'm just... I'm just
asking you the question.

690
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,195
I'm not turning it
into a war zone, Mom.

691
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,157
She is.
Why don't you talk to her?

692
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,072
Because she doesn't
listen to me. You do.

693
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,110
You'll do the right thing.
I know you will.

694
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,832
I mean, look at that
drink you're making.

695
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,035
You want one?

696
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,554
Oh.

697
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,516
What did I do to
make such a perfect kid, huh?

698
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,114
Could you point me in the
direction of the cat litter?

699
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,956
Uh...
Eight, I think.

700
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,158
You go to Lakewood, right?

701
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,309
Sometimes.

702
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,873
I've seen you around.

703
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,235
We've just
never really talked.

704
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,440
Freshman.

705
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,593
Junior.

706
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,509
I don't really need
the cat litter, I just, um...

707
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,398
I don't even know why I said that.
I don't even have a cat.

708
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,696
I just know they
shit a bunch, so...

709
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,755
I like your shoes.

710
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,232
I got to go.

711
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,674
Uh... Okay.

712
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,839
Look on
the bright side, you know?

713
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,829
I mean,
"Maybe they'll get married.

714
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,878
"And then my best friend
will be part of my family."

715
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,309
Helpful, thank you.

716
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,159
It really bothers me she's not
giving you rides anymore, though.

717
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,656
I'm gonna have to
talk to her about that.

718
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,079
No, you're not!

719
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:58,959
I can't drive you
every morning.

720
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,600
It puts me on the freeway late
and adds 40 minutes.

721
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,076
If you do that, I will do something
equally terrible to you.

722
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,594
I will tell everyone on Facebook
that you pluck your nipples.

723
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,795
How about that?

724
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,896
All right. Look, just tell me what
you wanna hear, and I'll say it.

725
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,592
Mom. I want to make
you feel better.

726
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,318
What can I say to do that?

727
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,753
I don't know.

728
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,080
Here's what I do
when I'm feeling down.

729
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:38,310
I get very quiet
and very still.

730
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,317
And I say to myself,

731
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:46,558
"Everyone in the world is as
miserable and empty as I am.

732
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,197
"They're just
better at pretending."

733
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,312
Try it sometime.

734
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,756
It might bring
you some peace.

735
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,039
Hey, do you guys
know where Erwin Kim is?

736
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,872
I guess he hangs out
around here sometimes.

737
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,520
Yeah, he's working on
his project for SFF.

738
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,828
SF what?

739
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,433
The Student Film Festival.

740
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,109
Right.
Yeah.

741
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,476
SFF.

742
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,160
Hey, um, I got to talk to you
about some homework.

743
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,400
I didn't need to talk to you
about homework, I lied.

744
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,991
You enjoying my company?

745
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,318
You're a barrel of monkeys.

746
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,072
You never told me
if you have a wife.

747
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,951
You should date my mother.

748
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,000
Her last boyfriend turned out
to be an Internet perv.

749
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,433
She's very, very fragile.

750
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,954
Very "Oh, save me."

751
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,200
Men like that, right, though?

752
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:09,716
'Cause at the end of the day
they all want to be a hero.

753
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,276
Everyone just wants to
feel important in life.

754
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,936
Thing is, no matter
how important they are,

755
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,951
there's always gonna be
someone more important.

756
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,678
People get so
uptight about that.

757
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,040
"Oh, no!
They're better than me."

758
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,112
It's like, God, they don't realize
important doesn't matter.

759
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,296
It's confidence.
The most confident person

760
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,231
in the room wins
every single time.

761
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,560
It doesn't matter
if it's real.

762
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,536
Doesn't matter if they're pulling
it straight outta their ass.

763
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,630
People are dumb.
They don't know the difference.

764
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,469
You know what?

765
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,676
I'm gonna go ahead
and I'm gonna tell you

766
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,640
the real reason I'm having
lunch with you today.

767
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,154
You see, I don't really have
any friends at the moment.

768
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:59,199
And to be completely honest with
you, I'm not interested at all.

769
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,635
My entire generation
is a bunch of mouth-breathers.

770
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:04,792
They literally have a seizure if you
take their phone away for a second.

771
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,216
They can't
communicate without emojis.

772
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,959
And they actually think that the
world wants to know that they are,

773
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,918
"Eating a taco, exclamation point,
smiley face, smiley face."

774
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,439
Like we give a fuck.

775
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,116
I am an old soul.

776
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:20,357
I like old music
and old movies

777
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,670
and even old people.

778
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:26,436
Bottom line is I have nothing in
common with the people out there,

779
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,795
and they have
nothing in common with me.

780
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,788
Nadine?

781
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,400
Max?

782
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,114
Maybe

783
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,792
nobody likes you.

784
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,918
You're a dick.

785
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,596
Maybe nobody likes you, huh?

786
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,870
You know,
you're always in a shit mood.

787
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,718
You're a really
shitty teacher.

788
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,070
You put zero effort
into everything you do here,

789
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,720
and there's no way
you're proud of that.

790
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,268
Look at you. Look at,
like, you do nothing.

791
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,475
Look at your hair.

792
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:03,836
You don't do your hair 'cause you don't
have any hair. You're bald.

793
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,736
And you know what? You know
why you're not married?

794
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,876
Because bald men are gross,
and they're disgusting

795
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,992
and especially the ones
that make $45,000 a year.

796
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,469
What?

797
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,791
I've been doing this 23 years,

798
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:47,668
and you're the first person to
ever underestimate my salary.

799
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,038
That made me feel good.

800
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,190
I mean, that part.

801
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,035
What are you doing?

802
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,073
I'm giving you
half my cookie.

803
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,799
Why?

804
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,674
Make you feel better. Jesus.

805
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,279
Guess what?

806
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,718
You're my favorite student.

807
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,360
Does that help?

808
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,038
Am I really your
favorite student?

809
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,711
Felt like
the right thing to say.

810
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:59,716
I didn't mean like
completely bald, by the way.

811
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,120
It's smart what
you do there, too.

812
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,754
You kind of, you know...

813
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,274
I don't know. Do you
poof it up a little bit?

814
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,120
Give a little zhuzh?

815
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,674
Glad you circled back around
and cleaned that up.

816
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,432
Certainly made me feel better.

817
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,635
The dog's good, but our real
competition is the hypnotoad.

818
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,034
No, no.
Yeah. No, I'm serious.

819
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,111
Practice is
so totally boring.

820
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,200
Hey.

821
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,397
Hey, I heard you were
looking for me at lunch.

822
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,915
Yeah, I can't
talk right now.

823
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,474
Oh, okay.
I just got... Okay.

824
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,678
Hello?
Sorry.

825
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,478
Um, I just took
some medicine.

826
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,736
I'll call you
after it kicks in.

827
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,149
Wait, wait, what's wrong?
Are you sick?

828
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,639
No, I'm fine.
I'm not... No.

829
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,312
Medicine, like, uh,

830
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,520
an antidepressant-whatever.

831
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,835
They gave them to me
when my dad died.

832
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,640
I was only on them
for like a month, though.

833
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,016
People take them,
like, all the time.

834
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,268
It's totally normal.

835
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,188
Oh?

836
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,296
Does that make you think I'm
pathetic all of the sudden?

837
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,390
Oh, no. No. No.

838
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,550
I think
you're perfectly fine.

839
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,560
Seriously.

840
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,031
Hey,
do you have a swimming pool?

841
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,910
Yeah.
Can I come swim in it?

842
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,228
I know I could swim in mine.
I just know I wouldn't relax.

843
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,355
Yes.

844
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,238
I got towels.
We're good to go.

845
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,679
We're green. We're good.

846
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,399
Okay. Cool.
I'll text you the address.

847
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,056
Yeah, I'll see you
in a little bit, then.

848
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,080
Okay.

849
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,759
Yeah-yeah-yeah. Yes!

850
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:16,868
Hey.

851
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,600
Jeez, Erwin,
I would've been nicer to you.

852
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,788
Ah.

853
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,752
God, I wish my
bathtub got this hot.

854
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,717
Why didn't you
tell me you were rich?

855
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,870
I thought I did.
I always try to tell everyone.

856
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,154
What?

857
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,839
Well, you didn't tell me that you
were in a film festival, either.

858
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,870
You don't tell me anything,
Erwin.

859
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,118
Well, maybe it's because
I couldn't get a word in.

860
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,360
Do I really talk that much?

861
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,919
Oh, yeah.

862
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,753
I'm gonna drown myself now.
Goodbye.

863
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,319
Bye.

864
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,919
Hey.

865
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,638
Thanks for
letting me come over.

866
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,954
I'm glad you did.

867
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,511
Do you wanna
have sex right now?

868
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,440
Okay.

869
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,116
I'm just kidding.
I was just...

870
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,634
You know that I was just
playing out the movie scene.

871
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,392
You ever feel like
you have to do that?

872
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,515
I mean, come on.

873
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,016
There's a waterfall.
It's all romantic.

874
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,713
Sure. Sure. Yeah. Right.

875
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,112
I'm sorry. I just...

876
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,115
Whatever.

877
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,468
What, are you mad now?
You can't be mad.

878
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,016
You were gonna have sex
with me two seconds ago.

879
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,632
You don't say
that stuff to a man.

880
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,199
Oh, "a man," huh?

881
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,069
All right.

882
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,709
Erwin, come...
What are you doing?

883
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,597
You're gonna press a button that
sucks me into the drain, aren't you?

884
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,314
Dickhead
You're such a dickhead

885
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,833
Oh, my God.

886
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,313
And everybody knows it

887
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,152
Everyone but you

888
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,832
You're a dickhead

889
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,990
I hope you'll soon be dead

890
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:17,591
And this is payback time
for what you put me through

891
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:19,472
You're a dickhead

892
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,318
Everybody's said

893
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:25,913
I hope you like
the song so screw you

894
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,071
So, what's your
film about, anyway?

895
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,440
Still figuring it out. Uh...

896
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,471
My drawing teacher asked a few of
us to enter an animation project.

897
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:49,394
Oh, that's cool. I didn't know you draw.
What kind of stuff?

898
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,836
Look at these. Wow.

899
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,913
Damn, Erwin.

900
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,355
Yeah,
this is mostly unfinished.

901
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,396
Just doodling, mostly.

902
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,038
But not quite where I...

903
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,829
Oh, I think
I found my favorite.

904
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,434
Oh, yeah, my parents
love that one, too.

905
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,397
Do they?
No, they don't.

906
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,199
That's just... No, they're very
conservative. No. They don't.

907
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,470
Wow. They're both you, right?

908
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,632
Yeah, I'm multifaceted.

909
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,311
Rad self-portrait.

910
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,075
Man.

911
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,879
Wow.

912
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,708
Man, Erwin,
you're really good.

913
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,910
Do you, uh, you know,
want to come on Saturday?

914
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,032
To see the film?

915
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:41,158
It's early in the morning,
super inconvenient, so...

916
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,434
I mean, I hope you say yes,

917
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,136
but, you know, you can take
that and think about it.

918
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,912
I don't expect an answer,
like, right now.

919
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,399
I mean,
'cause that would be rude.

920
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,635
That's a lot of pressure.

921
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,914
So, just laying it out there.

922
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,152
Yeah, I'd love to come.

923
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,675
Oh. Okay.

924
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,319
Are your parents going?

925
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,992
I could just sit with them.

926
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:04,319
Well, my parents are in Korea
for three months.

927
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,751
So, they won't make it.
Are you serious?

928
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,475
You've had this whole place
to yourself for three months?

929
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,516
Yay.

930
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,508
No, I get it.
It's... It's a big house.

931
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,079
You're bored.

932
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,471
You know what you need?

933
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:24,791
You need someone to rob you,
so you can reenact Home Alone.

934
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,199
That is...

935
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,757
That is exactly
what I need. Thank you.

936
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,479
That's crazy.

937
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:50,548
You're so bad.

938
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,672
I can't get out.

939
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,435
Can you just go
around the block once?

940
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,200
I'm not going around
the block. We're here.

941
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,196
Look, it's an
inappropriate time. Just go.

942
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:05,397
I have to be at
work at 8:30, Nadine.

943
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,834
Oh, my God.

944
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,070
Are we really
back to this again?

945
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,357
Oh, you've got to be
kidding me.

946
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,389
Thank you. You could just
loop around up here.

947
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,629
No, no, no.

948
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,709
I'm going to work.
You're coming with me.

949
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,190
You know, my boss isn't
gonna be happy about it,

950
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,396
and you're the one that
gets to explain it to him.

951
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,758
Don't you have
something to do?

952
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:40,271
Schoolwork or something?

953
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,509
Hmm?

954
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,680
Can I have this hole punch?
Give that to me.

955
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,976
I want you to just sit there
for the next eight hours

956
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,991
and don't touch anything
and don't make any noise.

957
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,469
Can I mime?

958
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,073
You're not funny.

959
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:30,360
If my husband had any idea
what I was gonna have to deal with...

960
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,833
I love how you refer
to him as your husband.

961
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,754
He is my husband.

962
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:41,115
You can run off and
get a new husband.

963
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,838
What he is, is my dad.

964
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,110
Can't you just say
that occasionally? Fine.

965
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,797
But we're not talking about him right now.
'Cause it's just too upsetting.

966
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,632
"It's just too
hard and too sad

967
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,318
"and it gives me
a cluster headache."

968
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,799
I know.

969
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:59,115
Oh, my God.
You have no compassion.

970
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,429
Actually,
I'm just bored because I know

971
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,240
everything you're
gonna do before you do it.

972
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,950
Sure you do.
Oh, you don't believe me.

973
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,360
No, I don't.

974
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:11,752
I'm gonna write down the next
thing you're gonna say to me.

975
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:12,955
I'm not gonna play

976
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:15,120
your little games, Nadine.
Your little games, Nadine.

977
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,437
Congratulations.
Mmm.

978
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:23,039
All right, you know what?

979
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,616
Here's something
you're not gonna guess.

980
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:25,755
Hmm.

981
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:31,552
Your dad would be so disappointed
in the way you're turning out.

982
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,278
Did you just take my keys?

983
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:46,195
Nadine.

984
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,440
Don't you take that car!

985
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:00,910
I will call the police!

986
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:20,995
God.

987
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,560
"Nick, I'm just gonna say it.

988
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:46,280
"I like you.
I've liked you for months.

989
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,096
"I think about
you every second.

990
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,111
"I don't know,
maybe I even love you.

991
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,959
"You're so complicated.
But simple.

992
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,156
"And I just feel this
connection between us.

993
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:59,028
"I feel like I already know you,
and I just wanna be with you.

994
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,232
"I wanna give you head.

995
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:04,118
"I want you to put
your mouth on my tits.

996
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,316
"I wanna feel you inside me.

997
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,358
"We can do it in
the Petland stockroom.

998
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,509
"Nadine."

999
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,838
Oh, my God.

1000
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,713
Oh, my God.

1001
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,596
You sound like
a fuckin' psychopath.

1002
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,831
You can't send this.

1003
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:27,829
What? No.

1004
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,519
Oh, my God.

1005
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,511
Oh, my God, no way.
No, no, no way. No.

1006
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:36,029
Fuck!

1007
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:37,918
Oh, my God!

1008
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,713
Shit.

1009
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,557
Look, I don't want to take up
a ton of your time,

1010
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:59,872
but I'm gonna kill myself.

1011
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:07,955
"You're complicated.
And simple.

1012
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,759
"And I just feel this
connection between us.

1013
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,393
"Feel like
I already know you."

1014
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,869
This is kind of sweet. I mean,
I think you're overreacting.

1015
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:19,272
"I just wanna be with you.
I wanna give you head.

"We can do it in
the Petland stockroom."

1019
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:40,469
Say something.

1020
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:44,757
Oh, my God. Say something, please!
Help me!

1021
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:47,752
You need to watch out
for run-on sentences.

1022
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,056
But can't you
just do something?

1023
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,680
Can't you just do something?

1024
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,631
You've gotta be
able to do something.

1025
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:53,915
Come on.

1026
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:58,239
I don't know, maybe
confiscate his phone? Um...

1027
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,832
Oh, his computer.
His computer.

1028
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:03,514
You can maybe
get his address.

1029
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,496
If you get his address,
and you confiscate his phone.

1030
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:06,976
Great. Get his address.
You give it to me.

1031
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,274
I'm gonna go there, and I'm...

1032
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,356
Nadine, Nadine.

1033
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:15,957
Just take fifth period off,
all right? Try to relax.

1034
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:19,876
Listen to some music.
Have a yogurt.

1035
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:24,351
Maybe just take it easy.
Can you do that?

1036
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:30,597
And, uh, if you have any,
you know, complications,

1037
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,235
let me know.

1038
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,278
Okay?
Okay.

1039
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:40,509
Don't worry.
Thank you.

1040
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:42,878
It's gonna be okay.

1041
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,313
Thank you.

1042
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,715
Can I have some money
for the yogurt?

1043
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,238
I want change.

1044
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,496
I just want you to know

1045
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,273
I've never been more
humiliated in my entire life.

1046
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:30,351
I absolutely cannot...

1047
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,917
Okay, Nadine, so now I need
you to pick up the phone.

1048
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:38,038
I just don't
understand you, Nadine. I...

1049
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:41,752
If you think you're keeping
that phone, you are dreaming.

1050
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,035
The second you come home,
that phone is going.

1051
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,918
I am done. I am done
trying to understand you.

1052
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:58,919
Come on. Please.

1053
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,871
Please, God, help me.

1054
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,071
Why do I even bother?

1055
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:20,831
Why do I even...

1056
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,957
You've never
given me one thing.

1057
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,389
Any time I ask you for
anything, you're like,

1058
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:31,233
"You need help with something?
Let me help you.

1059
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:34,232
"I'm just playin'. I'm gonna
butt-fuck you some more."

1060
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,959
Oh, my God.

1061
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,996
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1062
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,469
What?

1063
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:24,513
Holy shit.

1064
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,032
Holy shit.
Oh, my God. Okay. Calm down.

1065
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,037
Just relax.

1066
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:31,633
Um...

1067
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,630
Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

1068
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:45,909
Thank you.

1069
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,194
Ooh.

1070
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:32,195
Oh, mother...

1071
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,108
Oh, my...

1072
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,680
How many of those
do you bet are this asshole's?

1073
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,200
Please hurry
the hell up and graduate.

1074
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:06,559
Hey, one sec.

1075
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:09,229
Oh, tell Krista about
the time when...

1076
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:15,068
What? Wait. Just slow down.
What do you mean?

1077
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,556
Okay, Mom, calm down.

1078
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,870
Man, I do my best
to big you up.

1079
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:30,035
I'm just saying,
we could've won every game.

1080
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,873
I'm gonna catch up
with you guys later.

1081
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,269
Are you kidding, man?
No, it's a long story.

1082
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:36,589
All right.
I'll see you.

1083
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,239
See you, man.

1084
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,715
Hey. Hey, what happened?
It's fine.

1085
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,233
It's not fine.

1086
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:43,880
No, you're having fun.
You should stay.

1087
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,109
I'll come with you.

1088
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,873
Thanks.
Yeah.

1089
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:02,789
Hey.

1090
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,639
You look cute.

1091
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:29,559
Thank you.

1092
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:36,348
So do you... Yeah.

1093
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:43,875
Mom?

1094
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:46,908
Hey, Mom?

1095
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:48,992
Oh.

1096
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:52,949
What are you doin'?

1097
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:56,794
It's going to Goodwill.
All of it.

1098
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,996
Everything that's
on the floor, gone!

1099
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,111
Mom, why don't you
just calm down, okay?

1100
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,633
No.
I'm done putting up with it.

1101
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:05,959
All of this?

1102
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,109
All right. Hey.

1103
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:08,640
Oh, my God!
Can you believe it?

1104
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,193
It's okay.
What is this?

1105
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,355
What is all this crap?

1106
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:12,616
Just please,
please stop for a second.

1107
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:13,959
She left her flat iron on.

1108
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:15,792
She wants to burn
the goddamn house down!

1109
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:18,480
Can you stop for a second, please?
This is going.

1110
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,391
Okay. All right.
All right. All right.

1111
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,754
Stop. Just give it to me.
Hey!

1112
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,273
Just give me the bag!
Hey!

1113
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:24,634
I am the adult here!
Not you.

1114
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,638
Then why do you
always call me?

1115
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,319
Oh, my God.

1116
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:37,157
Oh, my God. You're right.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1117
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:45,477
I just don't have anybody else.
You're the only one.

1118
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,319
What are you doing?

1119
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,478
I'm handling it.

1120
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:12,833
Wow.

1121
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,434
Look at this view,
it's amazing.

1122
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,016
Look, you know what to do.

1123
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,031
I'm not gonna be an asshole
and tell you.

1124
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:49,709
Look, you know what to do...

1125
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,153
I love this song.

1126
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:00,355
It's really good.

1127
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,834
I can't believe
this is happening.

1128
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:45,158
There's so much that I've
wanted to tell you and ask you.

1129
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:46,920
And I just can't
believe this is happening.

1130
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,358
Um...

1131
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:57,398
Oh, wow, this just keeps
going back, doesn't it?

1132
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,034
Pull this down.

1133
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:25,754
Oh, God.

1134
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:29,073
I... I don't know if...

1135
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:30,275
Yeah. Just...

1136
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,035
Hold on, I gotta...

1137
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:37,456
I don't know if I should...

1138
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:39,232
No, get off! Get off! Off!

1139
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:40,514
Get off!
Okay! Okay.

1140
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,149
What the hell?

1141
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:12,560
I, uh... I really liked that song earlier.
What was the name of it again?

1142
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:16,117
Uh, I don't remember.

1143
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,796
I can just google it.

1144
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:29,948
Anyway,

1145
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:34,473
do you maybe wanna
go for a walk or something?

1146
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:42,399
We could maybe catch a movie.

1147
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,791
Or we could sit here silently in
your Mercury Marquis all night.

1148
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:53,875
Are you serious?

1149
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:55,555
What?

1150
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,512
What, now you're
making fun of my car?

1151
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:00,148
What? No.
I was just being specific.

1152
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,840
I wasn't saying that
because it's shitty.

1153
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:03,074
All right.

1154
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:04,616
No, God, no.
Look, I love your car, okay.

1155
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,914
I don't even have a car.

1156
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,096
I'm just acting weird, and this is
just all a lot.

1157
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:10,680
And please stop.
Please don't leave.

1158
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,159
Fuck!
What?

1159
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,117
I don't understand you.
What do you... What?

1160
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:41,200
What do you want?

1161
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,416
What do you mean,
what do I want?

1162
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:43,509
What do you want!

1163
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,632
To talk. To get to know you.

1164
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:47,256
Not just do it in
the first five seconds.

1165
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,430
You wrote me a novel
about how you were dying

1166
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,033
to blow me in Petland,
you psycho.

1167
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:54,078
I'm not here to
get to know you.

1168
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:59,553
This is so stupid.
So stupid.

1169
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:01,393
Why didn't I
listen to my friends?

1170
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,514
Oh, come on. Come on.

1171
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:11,356
Now you're gonna try
to make me the bad guy?

1172
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,873
You're the one
who messaged me.

1173
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:14,791
I hope you hit a tree
in this piece of shit.

1174
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:16,717
I hope you get
fucking paralyzed!

1175
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:35,678
Let's go, lady.

1176
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:39,958
Did you get a donut
from these people?

1177
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:41,709
No.

1178
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:14,960
What the...

1179
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:16,833
Why is that baby
in your house?

1180
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:20,715
Oh, shit. How the hell'd
that thing get in here?

1181
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,200
Hello.

1182
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:27,553
This is Toby.
And this is Greer.

1183
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:30,040
Hi.
How are you?

1184
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:32,111
Good, how are you doin'?
Good.

1185
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:33,355
Nice to meet you.

1186
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:34,999
Hi, nice...

1187
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:37,719
Now, your
mother's number?

1188
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:43,234
And who's got the stinky feet?
Who's got the stinky feet?

1189
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:44,759
Let me smell. Hold on.

1190
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,591
Oh! Oh! Oh...

1191
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:51,191
Toby's
got the stinky feet.

1192
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:54,032
Don't stare.
It makes him self-conscious.

1193
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:57,108
Can I get you
something else?

1194
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:59,515
Any ice cream or anything
before I put the baby down?

1195
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:00,868
I'm good, thank you.

1196
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:03,635
No, no, I can feed
and water her from here.

1197
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:04,994
All right.

1198
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,594
All right. Come on, tiny man.
It's you and me, buddy.

1199
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,318
Big boy.
There you go.

1200
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:11,909
Yeah.

1201
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:14,549
Look, I just want to say,
I don't know the whole story,

1202
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:17,108
but, whatever it is,
it'll pass.

1203
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:19,356
I went through a rough time
not too long ago, too.

1204
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:20,953
But look
where it led me.

1205
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:23,231
This is the face
of hope.

1206
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:28,718
All right.
Good night.

1207
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,791
I'll be in, in a minute.
All right. Good night.

1208
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:32,672
Good night.
Say, "Night-night."

1209
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:34,671
Good night.
Night-night, Daddy.

1210
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,159
Night-night.

1211
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:39,872
I think that's
for you.

1212
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:43,954
Come on.

1213
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:54,032
No, that's not my mother.
Don't open the door.

1214
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:55,599
Hello there.

1215
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:08,628
What are you
doing here?

1216
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:10,035
Get in the car.
Let's go.

1217
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:12,470
No, Mom's picking me up.
No, she's not.

1218
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:13,868
Get in the car.

1219
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:18,000
Well, I don't feel like getting
in the car with you and her.

1220
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,831
Do you know what I've
been doing all night?

1221
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,797
I'll find another ride.

1222
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:27,995
Hey. Hey,
get in the car.

1223
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:29,240
Stop!

1224
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,998
No, you think
this is fun for me?

1225
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:32,758
Let go of me!
You think I like this?

1226
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:33,915
Where were you?

1227
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,918
You can't pick up
your phone even once?

1228
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,576
You don't need to pretend
to give a shit about me

1229
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:39,919
just because
people are watching.

1230
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,149
Oh, give me a break.

1231
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:42,309
Oh, face it.

1232
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,914
You can't wait to take me home
so you can be Mom's little hero.

1233
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,911
You live for that shit.

1234
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:02,829
Just let it go.

1235
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:05,913
Darian.

1236
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:08,355
Darian?

1237
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,296
Hey, I just want you to know
you're right, Nadine.

1238
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:15,920
Darian, we don't need to do this...
You're right about everything!

1239
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:22,110
I don't give
a shit about you.

1240
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:26,637
I'm only here for me,
and my life is fuckin' incredible.

1241
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:28,429
I love it.

1242
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:33,879
No, I love spending another night
talking Mom off the ledge.

1243
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:35,632
I love only applying
to schools nearby

1244
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:37,176
because who knows
what'll happen in the house

1245
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:38,428
if I'm not around
to fix it?

1246
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:39,794
And I love

1247
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:42,478
that the one person
who makes me feel

1248
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,192
like I could take
a fuckin' breath,

1249
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:51,713
I can't have without
completely destroying you.

1250
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,079
So, you're right.

1251
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:58,236
You're right.
It's a blast.

1252
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,069
I win.

1253
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,956
Hey, can you give her
a ride home, please?

1254
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:12,149
Thanks.

1255
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57,436
Look, I'm not very good
at this kind of thing. Uh...

1256
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:03,429
But I think we both know what
needs to be said right now,

1257
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,951
so I'm just gonna come
right out and say it.

1258
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:11,833
Get out of the car.

1259
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:24,156
Bye.
See you Monday.

1260
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:21,434
Hey.

1261
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:35,390
Look, I just wanted
to say that

1262
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:41,471
I'm sorry for being
a bitch tonight.

1263
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:47,074
For the past couple weeks.

1264
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:51,396
And the past 17 years
before that.

1265
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:57,275
I know this isn't
any easier for you.

1266
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:58,509
I know that.

1267
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:02,349
I think some deranged
part of me likes thinking

1268
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,994
I'm the only one
with real problems.

1269
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:08,318
Like that makes me special.

1270
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:15,236
You know, ever since
we were little,

1271
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:17,430
I would get
this feeling like...

1272
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:23,758
Like I'm floating outside of my body,
looking down on myself.

1273
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,355
And I hate what I see.

1274
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:33,789
How I'm acting,
the way I sound.

1275
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:38,908
And I don't know
how to change it.

1276
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:42,715
And I'm so scared

1277
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:46,712
that that feeling is
never gonna go away.

1278
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,558
I'm sorry.

1279
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:58,519
Really.

1280
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:01,993
Good night.

1281
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:06,109
Hey, Nadine.

1282
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:52,676
Good night.
Good night.

1283
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:19,756
Hey.
Hey.

1284
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:21,949
You're up early.

1285
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:25,709
Uh, yeah. I, um, I got...
I got a thing to go to.

1286
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,069
Yeah.

1287
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:29,516
Well,
have a good day.

1288
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:35,920
You as well.

1289
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:40,514
Have a good day,
both of you.

1290
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:41,789
Have a great day.

1291
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:43,633
Thank you.

1292
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:45,560
Um...

1293
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,033
Can I call you later?

1294
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:51,234
Okay.

1295
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:56,598
That was good.
Mmm-hmm.

1296
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:58,636
Right?
That was so good.

1297
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:00,073
I miss her.

1298
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:30,159
Nadine?

1299
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:40,791
Sit back, relax, and get
ready to enjoy the films.

1300
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:55,276
Turn off
your cell phone, please.

1301
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:02,232
Can I squeeze in? Thanks.

1302
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:05,675
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1303
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:06,553
Really somethin', wasn't it?
Let's keep things going.

1304
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:09,473
Our next entry, ladies and gentlemen,
comes from Erwin Kim of...

1305
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:10,880
Whoo!

1306
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,436
Thank you. Of Lakewood High.
Mr. Kim, would you like to come out

1307
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:17,158
and say a few words
about your film?

1308
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:23,079
Come on.

1309
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,914
Hello. Thank you
for coming. Um...

1310
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:32,954
Hope
you enjoy this, uh...

1311
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:36,595
My, uh...

1312
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:41,797
Uh...

1313
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:46,316
You can just take this.
Thanks. Thank you.

1314
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:47,400
Whoo.

1315
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:53,671
Uh, okay.
Well, here it is.

1316
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:55,757
Mr. Kim's film.

1317
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:07,196
Once upon a time on
a planet called Not Saturn

1318
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:11,868
at Alien Planet High School...

1319
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:14,599
Watch out! Watch out!
Watch out! Watch out!

1320
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:20,076
...there was an alien adolescent
who was struck by love.

1321
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:26,472
Hmm? Mmm-mmm.

1322
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:29,800
Hmm?

1323
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:30,960
Mmm-mmm.

1324
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:34,153
Mmm-mmm.
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm!

1325
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:12,840
Aww.

1326
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:16,029
Huh?

1327
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:18,349
Hmm.

1328
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:21,040
Oh.

1329
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:22,160
Aww.

1330
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:25,635
Uh-oh.

1331
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:32,991
Mmm.

1332
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:34,274
Too late!

1333
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,228
Pool party!

1334
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:51,560
Whoo!

1335
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:06,913
Erwin.

1336
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,068
That...

1337
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,400
Wow.

1338
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:13,831
Well, I mean,
I wouldn't go that far.

1339
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:16,629
It was all right.
It was amazing. Really.

1340
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:19,913
Oh, thanks!

1341
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:27,319
And I got the message,
all right? I know...

1342
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,431
I know she's me.

1343
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:32,712
But I already figured
out how great you are.

1344
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:35,519
You're so fucking great.

1345
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:38,114
You're like
the best person I know.

1346
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:43,270
What? What's wrong?

1347
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:46,478
Um, the film
wasn't about you.

1348
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:49,318
Oh, God.

1349
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:51,435
Shoot.

1350
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:55,120
Sorry, I thought
maybe because the hair

1351
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:57,270
and, like, the cool shoes that...
Oh...

1352
01:37:58,440 --> 01:38:01,113
Wow. I'm one of those people that
thinks everything is about them.

1353
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:03,712
I'm just messing
with you.

1354
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:08,438
Yeah, I'm just messing
with you. I set that up.

1355
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:10,398
You shithead.
Yes.

1356
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:12,256
Felt pretty good. You...
You being nervous for once.

1357
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:14,874
And I'm just over here, like,
just sniffin' my flowers.

1358
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:18,356
I hate you so much.

1359
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:20,149
You free to hang?

1360
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:24,713
Yeah, I am. Cleared my
whole schedule for you.

1361
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:26,392
Oh, good. Come on.

1362
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:28,636
Say hi
to some people.

1363
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:32,750
Dude, you did
such a good job.

1364
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:33,989
Insane!

1365
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:35,274
Thank you,
thank you.

1366
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:37,353
Guys, this is Nadine.

1367
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,668
Hi. How's it goin'?

1368
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:39,915
Good, how are you?

1369
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,036
I'm good. Thanks.
That was so good.

1370
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:44,918
I just can't get over it.
It was amazing.
