(SHUDDERING)

659
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,153
Is that a spider
on my back?

660
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,780
Will you quit it?

661
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,115
it’s just a leaf.
Turn around.

00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,580
Leaf. Told you.

00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:47,334
Now, come on, we need
to find a safe place
to spend the night.

664
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,543
Safe? Safe?

665
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,003
We are in the jungle.

666
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,047
You know when people say,
"it’s a jungle out there"?

667
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,965
Well, I’m pretty sure
they don't mean it
as a good thing.

668
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,675
Look, l hate to
break it to you,

669
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,053

kind naturally lives.

to me about nature.

Out here, I’m just an
hors d'oeuvre.

674
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,608
Nothing more than
a feathery spring roll.

675
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,945
That is why we stay
in the trees and
not on the ground.

more comfortable

Hey, how about
up there?

Birds. Birds
need flying.

692
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,740
Flying is. . .

693
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:05,162
it’s freedom
and not having
to rely on anyone.

694
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,415
Don't you want that?

695

It sounds a little lonely.

Look, let's just get

Yeah !

Come on, guys, let's go!

1299
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:06,730
What are we
standing around for?

Oh, yeah !

1302
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:20,952
Yep.

1303
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:23,121
l know just how you feel.

1304
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:24,956
Watching them up there

1305
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:28,293
makes you want to chase them
and grab them in your mouth

1306
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:30,670
and bite their
heads off, huh?

1307
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:33,882
(LAUGHING)

1308
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:35,675
I’m just kidding, bro.

1309
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:38,094
Yeah, chasing them
is plenty.

1310
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:52,275
JEWEL: I’m flying,
flying just like a bird!

1311
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:54,652
PEDRO: Jewel,
but you are a bird !

1312
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:01,159
Hey! Where you going?

1313
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,079
Blu?

1314
01:08:06,999 --> 01:08:08,291
Blu, what's wrong?

1315
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:11,127
Nothing.
Everything is perfect.

1316
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:12,754
You'll be off
to the rainforest,

1317
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:14,672
I’ll be back with Linda,
just like we planned.

1318
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:18,301
Hey, birds!
Stop yapping and
start flapping !

1319
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:19,511
Let's go!

1320

l guess,
l thought, maybe. . .

1321
01:08:22,389 --> 01:08:24,307
What? That you'd
come to Minnesota?

1322
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:26,267
Great, l guess
I’ll knit you a scarf.

1323
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:28,686
No, that's not
what l meant.

1324
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:30,855
Look, Jewel,
l can't spend my life

1325
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:33,316
walking around following you
wherever you're going.

1326
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:36,027
Hey, it's not my
fault you can't fly.

1327
01:08:38,322 --> 01:08:39,614
Awkward.

1328
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:40,865
Okay, okay.

1329
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:44,119
You know what?
This is good.
Just clear the air.

1330
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:46,121
Just be completely honest
with each other.

1331
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:48,915
You want honesty?
Fine, l can be honest.

1332
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,125
l don't belong here.

1333
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:53,002
In fact, l never
wanted to come here
in the first place.

1334
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:55,130
And. . . And. . .

1335
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:57,006
And you know what?

1336
01:08:57,174 --> 01:08:58,508

Hey! That's
a little too far.

1340
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:05,431
Make the mean bird
take it back.

1341
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:07,058
Yeah, l said it.

1342
01:09:07,184 --> 01:09:09,394

01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:18,194
Fine!
See you around, pet!

1347
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:19,737
No, wait, wait.
Come back!

1348
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:23,908
You belong together!
You are Juliet to his Romeo!

1349
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:26,244
Sure, they both
die in the end,

1350
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:27,912
but you get my point!

1351
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:31,416
Young love.
Always so melodramatic.

1352
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,919
All right, boys,
go after her.

1353
01:09:35,963 --> 01:09:39,090
Blu ! Come back here.
Come on !

1354
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:41,593
Yeah ! I’m ready
for Carnaval !

1355

to ride in my

fruit.

1357
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:47,932
You left without me.

the wrong direction.

Isn't Carnaval that way?

1382
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:54,249
I’m not going
to Carnaval.

1383

No, I’m going home.

1384
01:10:55,876 --> 01:10:57,252
But l thought
you loved Carnaval.

1385
01:10:57,628 --> 01:11:00,672
l do. But l love
my family much more.

1386
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:03,675
And that's a choice
l made with this.

1387

Not with this.

and then l saw
this big cockatoo!

With big ninja talons!

1391
01:11:11,016 --> 01:11:13,017
This cockatoo was ugly!
Anyway, that's not the point.

1392
01:11:13,143 --> 01:11:15,436
And then Jewel was there,
and he snatched Jewel up.

1393
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:16,938
Like, he snatched her up.
And then he was like,

1394
01:11:17,022 --> 01:11:18,690
"You're coming with me,
you little princess."

1395

"l ain't your princess,
leave me alone."

1397

And l was like, "What?"
Then he was like, "What?"

1398
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:25,154
Stop! Just tell me
what happened.

1399
01:11:25,322 --> 01:11:26,489
He got Jewel, man !

1400

And he's taking her
to the parade.
