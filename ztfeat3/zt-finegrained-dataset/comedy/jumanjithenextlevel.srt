2
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:12,358
Leaving this to come see you.

3
00:01:12,492 --> 00:01:14,959
And I can't wait.

4
00:01:34,826 --> 00:01:35,959
Whew.

5
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:47,126
Taxi! Over here.

6
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:55,926
Taxi!

7
00:01:56,059 --> 00:01:58,992
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.

8
00:01:59,126 --> 00:02:02,325
Excuse me. Excuse me.

9
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:23,826
- Gilpin!
- Ahh!

10
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:26,725
You still on the toothpaste?
Are you on your phone?

11
00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:29,592
I'm just... I'm going home
for the holidays tonight, so...

12
00:02:29,725 --> 00:02:31,193
Does it look like
tonight to you?

13
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:33,293
Because to me,
it looks like today.

14
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:36,425
- Finish the toothpaste.
- Okay. Sorry.

15
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,859
Dad, we're home!

16
00:03:48,992 --> 00:03:51,159
I'm in the kitchen!

17
00:03:51,293 --> 00:03:53,325
Jan, Spencer!

18
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,026
In the kitchen!

19
00:03:57,293 --> 00:03:59,625
Dad, are you on a ladder?

20
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:00,992
- What are you doing?
- Grandpa.

21
00:04:01,126 --> 00:04:02,458
- What's it look like?
- Get down.

22
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:03,959
I'm changing your light bulb.

23
00:04:04,092 --> 00:04:06,159
I leave for 10 minutes,
you're climbing ladders?

24
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:07,992
Don't think
you should be doing that.

25
00:04:08,126 --> 00:04:09,859
You think I can't
change a light bulb?

26
00:04:09,992 --> 00:04:12,458
- Okay.
- There.

27
00:04:12,592 --> 00:04:14,592
Ugh! No, no, no.

28
00:04:14,725 --> 00:04:16,425
- I got it. I'm fine.
- Okay.

29
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:18,458
Hey, kiddo!

30
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,625
Hey, how's New York City?

31
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,492
- It's great.
- How's school?

32
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,659
It's okay. How you doing?

33
00:04:26,792 --> 00:04:29,293
I'm terrific. I don't
even know what I'm doing here.

34
00:04:29,425 --> 00:04:30,992
You're recovering
from hip surgery.

35
00:04:31,126 --> 00:04:33,492
Meh! I'll be out
of here in no time.

36
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:34,659
It's not a prison.

37
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:36,425
I wanna get back
to my apartment.

38
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:39,592
- Is that so terrible?
- Your apartment? It's terrible.

39
00:04:39,725 --> 00:04:41,193
Is it really cold in here?

40
00:04:41,325 --> 00:04:43,159
The downstairs heater
isn't working.

41
00:04:43,293 --> 00:04:46,592
- The guy's coming in the morning.
- It's like a goddamn icebox.

42
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,992
Did you ever call Milo?

43
00:04:49,126 --> 00:04:50,425
What? No.

44
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,992
Dad. He's called five times.
Just call him back.

45
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,659
I'm not calling him back.
I don't wanna talk to him.

46
00:04:57,092 --> 00:04:59,792
Come on, I'll help you
with your bags.

47
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,525
Oh, you're staying in here.

48
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:05,525
We're roommates.

49
00:05:05,659 --> 00:05:08,492
Yeah. I could just stay
downstairs on the couch.

50
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,692
- What? Don't be ridiculous.
- If you want, yeah.

51
00:05:10,826 --> 00:05:12,792
It's a couple weeks.
It's gonna be fine.

52
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:15,026
Come on in.
Make yourself comfortable.

53
00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:18,026
- Oh! You're gonna...
- Whoa!

54
00:05:20,126 --> 00:05:22,625
- You okay?
- Don't tell your mother!

55
00:05:23,826 --> 00:05:27,226
This goes there. There.

56
00:05:27,358 --> 00:05:29,892
That's in there.

57
00:05:30,026 --> 00:05:32,026
- All right, let's try it.
- Okay, let's see.

58
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,293
All right, so there's that.

59
00:05:34,425 --> 00:05:36,159
There's this. There's this.

60
00:05:36,293 --> 00:05:39,592
The blue light, the red,
the green light.

61
00:05:41,492 --> 00:05:44,458
Oh, look at you two.
How sweet is this?

62
00:05:44,592 --> 00:05:47,826
Okay, I have to leave for work
before either of you gets up.

63
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,792
The heater guy's
coming in the morning.

64
00:05:49,926 --> 00:05:52,126
I'm gonna meet
my friends for brunch at 10.

65
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:53,959
That'll be nice.
Where are you going?

66
00:05:54,092 --> 00:05:57,792
- Um... Nora's.
- What are you going there for?

67
00:05:57,926 --> 00:05:59,392
All the restaurants
in Brantford,

68
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,492
- you gotta go to that one?
- I didn't pick.

69
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,959
What difference does it make?
It's been years.

70
00:06:04,092 --> 00:06:06,059
I love you, honey.
I'm so glad you're home.

71
00:06:06,193 --> 00:06:07,458
Love you too, Mom.

72
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:17,992
Getting old sucks. Don't let
anybody tell you any different.

73
00:06:18,126 --> 00:06:20,625
You still got
that little girlfriend?

74
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,792
No.

75
00:06:22,926 --> 00:06:24,592
We're not together anymore.

76
00:06:24,725 --> 00:06:26,659
I don't think.

77
00:06:26,792 --> 00:06:28,659
Was it her or you?

78
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:30,559
- It's complicated.
- Try me.

79
00:06:30,692 --> 00:06:33,559
We'll see
if I can understand.

80
00:06:33,692 --> 00:06:38,026
Well, when we
first got together,

81
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,392
we were...

82
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,692
sort of different people
than we are now.

83
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:48,592
I mean, last year was...

84
00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:50,458
amazing.

85
00:06:50,592 --> 00:06:52,458
I was a senior in high school.

86
00:06:52,592 --> 00:06:54,659
I had a girlfriend.

87
00:06:54,792 --> 00:06:58,659
Like, I finally figured out
who I was or something.

88
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,892
Mm.

89
00:07:01,026 --> 00:07:03,792
I wish I could just feel
like that again, I guess.

90
00:07:07,092 --> 00:07:08,226
I don't know.

91
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:10,358
Long-distance
relationships are hard.

92
00:07:10,492 --> 00:07:14,458
I mean, I know everybody says
that, but turns out it's true.

93
00:07:16,126 --> 00:07:18,759
Can I give you a little advice?
Listen to me.

94
00:07:18,892 --> 00:07:21,959
Every single day
on every single subway car,

95
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:24,659
there's lots of ladies
in New York City.

96
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:29,425
And one in five of them, I would
marry, no questions asked.

97
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:32,358
This is the best time
of your life.

98
00:07:32,492 --> 00:07:34,659
- It is?
- Yes, it is.

99
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:37,725
So pull it together! It doesn't
get any better than this.

100
00:07:37,859 --> 00:07:40,659
It's all downhill from here.

101
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,051
Bravestone.

102
00:09:59,284 --> 00:10:00,184
Hi!

103
00:10:00,317 --> 00:10:01,550
Yay, yay, yay!

104
00:10:01,683 --> 00:10:03,117
- Ooh!
- Oh, gosh, how are you?

105
00:10:03,251 --> 00:10:06,017
- Oh, my God, you look amazing.
- Thank you.

106
00:10:06,151 --> 00:10:07,550
Ho, ho, ho!

107
00:10:07,683 --> 00:10:09,351
- Fridge.
- Fridge!

108
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:10,850
- Come here.
- Ooh!

109
00:10:10,984 --> 00:10:13,451
So we were building houses
for two months,

110
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,017
and then on the way home,
we stopped in Costa Rica,

111
00:10:16,151 --> 00:10:18,451
which was also amazing.

112
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,850
That is so awesome.
I am so happy for you.

113
00:10:20,984 --> 00:10:22,550
That is so cool.

114
00:10:22,683 --> 00:10:25,683
So, "M," that's what
we're supposed to call you now?

115
00:10:25,817 --> 00:10:28,084
You don't have to.
It's just a nickname.

116
00:10:28,217 --> 00:10:30,251
One of my college friends
gave me that.

117
00:10:30,384 --> 00:10:32,184
You don't have to call me that.

118
00:10:32,317 --> 00:10:34,351
M. I love it. It's so hot.

119
00:10:34,484 --> 00:10:36,850
- Okay.
- But you and Spencer,

120
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:40,683
- you're still not...?
- Yeah. No. Um, we're...

121
00:10:40,817 --> 00:10:42,817
We're still,
like, taking a break.

122
00:10:44,117 --> 00:10:46,184
Where is he, by the way?

123
00:11:05,151 --> 00:11:07,051
Eh, Christ.

124
00:11:07,184 --> 00:11:09,451
What do you want, Milo?

125
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,284
Nice to see you too.

126
00:11:13,418 --> 00:11:17,051
Yes, I'd love to come in
for a cup of coffee.

127
00:11:17,184 --> 00:11:18,617
Thanks for asking.

128
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,884
You mind if I make some eggs?

129
00:11:26,017 --> 00:11:27,583
Do whatever you want.
I don't care.

130
00:11:27,717 --> 00:11:29,717
Just hurry up.
I don't have all day.

131
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,251
You going somewhere?

132
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,418
Have, um...?

133
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:40,317
Have you been in touch
with Spencer much?

134
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:41,683
Yeah...

135
00:11:43,451 --> 00:11:45,217
You know what?

136
00:11:45,351 --> 00:11:46,850
Not really, actually.

137
00:11:46,984 --> 00:11:50,251
I text him a lot, but
he doesn't always text me back.

138
00:11:50,384 --> 00:11:51,650
- I know.
- It's just...

139
00:11:51,784 --> 00:11:53,317
I've been crazed lately

140
00:11:53,451 --> 00:11:55,650
with, you know,
classes and practices,

141
00:11:55,784 --> 00:11:57,351
and I got games
on the weekends.

142
00:11:57,484 --> 00:12:00,518
Yeah. Totally. Totally.

143
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,418
I've just... I've been... I've
been a little worried about him.

144
00:12:07,484 --> 00:12:11,017
Okay, look, where...?
Where is this guy? For real.

145
00:12:15,017 --> 00:12:16,451
Good?

146
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:19,451
- Meh.
- What do you mean, "Meh"?

147
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,017
Meh! What do you want already?

148
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:23,617
You've been calling
and calling.

149
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,184
You show up out of the blue
after 15 years.

150
00:12:26,317 --> 00:12:28,950
Why? 'Cause you wanna
make some eggs?

151
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,950
You remember
when we first opened,

152
00:12:36,084 --> 00:12:39,750
we had that
little dishwasher, Morris?

153
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,650
Yeah, of course
I remember Morris.

154
00:12:41,784 --> 00:12:43,683
Worked the dinner shift.

155
00:12:43,817 --> 00:12:47,418
Six days a week,
2 in the morning most nights.

156
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:51,583
- The dishwasher.
- Little Morris. Mm.

157
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:54,518
He wouldn't even touch those
saucepans until he was done

158
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,151
with every single utensil
in the bin.

159
00:12:59,817 --> 00:13:02,217
Yeah, the man knew his craft.

160
00:13:03,384 --> 00:13:04,850
Little Morris.

161
00:13:08,351 --> 00:13:09,950
Well, get... Wha...

162
00:13:10,084 --> 00:13:11,884
Just get to it, would you?

163
00:13:12,017 --> 00:13:14,518
I mean, it's always
the scenic route with you.

164
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,351
I know what you want,
you want to apologize.

165
00:13:17,484 --> 00:13:19,451
And I hate to tell you,
I'm not interested.

166
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:23,051
You think I'm supposed
to apologize?

167
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,617
Oh, heater guy.

168
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,683
- Grandpa Eddie?
- Anthony?

169
00:13:30,817 --> 00:13:31,884
Yes, sir, it's me.

170
00:13:32,017 --> 00:13:33,750
Anthony!

171
00:13:33,884 --> 00:13:35,017
How are you?

172
00:13:35,151 --> 00:13:36,884
Come on in. Come on in.

173
00:13:39,884 --> 00:13:42,518
- How you doing?
- Oh, getting old sucks.

174
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,518
Don't let anybody
tell you any different.

175
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,484
Heh, heh. Oh, uh, this is
uh, Martha and-and Bethany.

176
00:13:47,617 --> 00:13:49,317
This is Spencer's
grandfather, Eddie.

177
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:51,984
Martha?
You're the little girlfriend.

178
00:13:52,117 --> 00:13:53,817
- Uh...
- Morning!

179
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,184
Morning, sir.
Sorry to barge in on you.

180
00:13:56,317 --> 00:13:58,550
You're not barging.
He's barging.

181
00:13:58,683 --> 00:14:00,518
Milo Walker.

182
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,850
Wait, Milo? Like...
Like Milo and Eddie's.

183
00:14:03,984 --> 00:14:05,683
- Pleased to meet you.
- Man, my dad said

184
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:07,351
you guys had
the best restaurant.

185
00:14:07,484 --> 00:14:10,084
We were just there.
Well, it's called Nora's now.

186
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:13,617
Pfft, Nora's.
It's barely even a restaurant.

187
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,518
It's more like
a breakfast place now.

188
00:14:17,518 --> 00:14:19,084
Were you with Spencer?

189
00:14:19,217 --> 00:14:21,850
No, we came here
looking for him, actually.

190
00:14:21,984 --> 00:14:24,084
You all hungry?
Eggs on the griddle.

191
00:14:24,217 --> 00:14:26,017
- Might have to take a look.
- Hey, man,

192
00:14:26,151 --> 00:14:27,917
you can do more
than take a look at it.

193
00:14:28,051 --> 00:14:29,850
All right, all right. My man.

194
00:14:32,184 --> 00:14:37,084
- Whoa. Do you need a hand?
- Do I look like I need a hand?

195
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:44,017
Martha?

196
00:14:47,784 --> 00:14:48,817
Hey.

197
00:14:50,683 --> 00:14:52,550
Where is he?

198
00:15:02,317 --> 00:15:04,583
- Do you hear that?
- Yes.

199
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,884
You hear something?

200
00:15:12,017 --> 00:15:13,950
It's probably the heater.
It's broken.

201
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,583
How did it
even get here?

202
00:15:20,717 --> 00:15:22,418
I don't know.

203
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,451
Maybe he...
I don't know,

204
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,850
maybe he went back for it
or something?

205
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:30,683
Is he trying
to fix it?

206
00:15:30,817 --> 00:15:33,351
Why would anyone
try to fix that thing?

207
00:15:33,484 --> 00:15:35,084
I don't know.

208
00:15:35,217 --> 00:15:38,251
I don't know. Maybe he went
to buy parts or something?

209
00:15:38,384 --> 00:15:40,251
Okay, look,
I'm calling him again.

210
00:15:40,384 --> 00:15:43,418
I'm sure everything's... fine.

211
00:16:02,884 --> 00:16:04,750
Fourteen texts
and four missed calls.

212
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,884
I don't think he went out.

213
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,683
I think...

214
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,117
I think he went back in.

215
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:19,418
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no...

216
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:20,617
- What? No. Why...?
- Come on, man!

217
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,917
Why would he do that?

218
00:16:22,051 --> 00:16:23,683
Remember what it was like?

219
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,351
- I got eaten by a fricking hippo!
- I got killed by a piece of cake!

220
00:16:26,484 --> 00:16:28,251
Guys, guys.

221
00:16:28,384 --> 00:16:31,051
How is he gonna get out?

222
00:16:31,184 --> 00:16:34,717
Uh, he's gotta take the...
The green jewel.

223
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,217
And stick it back
in the statue thing.

224
00:16:37,351 --> 00:16:38,451
By himself?

225
00:16:54,017 --> 00:16:55,151
We gotta go get him.

226
00:16:55,284 --> 00:16:56,683
Are you crazy?

227
00:16:56,817 --> 00:16:59,017
- I'm coming with you.
- Are you out of your minds?

228
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,850
We can do this. We've been
there. We know what to expect.

229
00:17:01,984 --> 00:17:03,984
I gotta stop hanging out
with white people.

230
00:17:04,117 --> 00:17:05,317
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

231
00:17:05,451 --> 00:17:07,984
She's right. We played
before and we won.

232
00:17:08,117 --> 00:17:09,550
We barely survived!

233
00:17:09,683 --> 00:17:12,418
You know
he would do it for you.

234
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,518
For any of us.

235
00:17:20,884 --> 00:17:23,518
Be careful.
It looks pretty busted.

236
00:17:28,884 --> 00:17:30,617
<i>Welcome to Jumanji.</i>

237
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,917
What...? We haven't even
picked our guys yet!

238
00:17:35,051 --> 00:17:36,850
What?

239
00:17:36,984 --> 00:17:41,251
Okay, okay. Here we go. Oh, I
hate this part. All right. Okay.

240
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,884
This is not happening!

241
00:17:53,384 --> 00:17:55,151
You guys?

242
00:17:59,017 --> 00:18:00,217
No!

243
00:18:18,984 --> 00:18:20,418
Am I...?

244
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,550
Is it...? I can't believe...

245
00:18:23,683 --> 00:18:25,351
Oh!

246
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:29,850
Oh, it's her.

247
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:30,884
I'm her.

248
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:39,550
Spencer.

249
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,884
Spencer?

250
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:49,017
What in tarnation?

251
00:18:49,151 --> 00:18:51,084
Where am I?

252
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:53,717
What the hell is this?

253
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:56,717
Oh, my God.

254
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:57,884
Eddie?

255
00:18:59,817 --> 00:19:03,384
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Milo Walker. Who are you?

256
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,518
Milo?

257
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,017
What on earth? What...?

258
00:19:08,151 --> 00:19:09,184
- What the...?
- Oh, my.

259
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:10,384
Wait a minute.

260
00:19:10,518 --> 00:19:11,984
Oh, Lord.

261
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:14,384
- This isn't happening.
- Pardon me?

262
00:19:14,518 --> 00:19:17,583
- Who are you?
- You're Spencer's grandfather.

263
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:20,850
- Yeah, no kidding.
- And you are Milo.

264
00:19:20,984 --> 00:19:22,351
I certainly am.

265
00:19:22,484 --> 00:19:24,617
I'm Martha, Spencer's...

266
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,750
You're the little girlfriend?

267
00:19:26,884 --> 00:19:28,384
- Look out!
- What?

268
00:19:29,884 --> 00:19:32,750
- Ah! Oh, oh!
- Oh, Lord.

269
00:19:32,884 --> 00:19:35,750
That hurt like a goddamn...

270
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:39,550
- Bethany?
- What? I'm not...

271
00:19:39,683 --> 00:19:41,550
No.

272
00:19:41,683 --> 00:19:45,217
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no...

273
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,451
Yo!

274
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:51,418
Oh, no, no, no.
This can't be happening!

275
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,451
Fridge?

276
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,583
Yes, I'm Fridge, goddamn it!

277
00:19:54,717 --> 00:19:56,683
The hell, man?

278
00:19:56,817 --> 00:20:00,051
Okay.
Okay, something went wrong.

279
00:20:00,184 --> 00:20:01,151
You think?

280
00:20:04,384 --> 00:20:06,484
Holy...

281
00:20:06,617 --> 00:20:08,650
Wait. If I'm...

282
00:20:08,784 --> 00:20:10,850
Then you...? Spencer?

283
00:20:10,984 --> 00:20:13,217
Why does everybody
keep calling me Spencer?

284
00:20:13,351 --> 00:20:17,884
No, that is Grandpa Eddie.
And that, heh... is Milo.

285
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,418
Pleased to meet you.

286
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,051
What?

287
00:20:21,184 --> 00:20:23,151
Then where's Bethany?
And where's Spencer?

288
00:20:23,284 --> 00:20:24,850
I don't know! Okay?

289
00:20:24,984 --> 00:20:27,251
The game, it didn't
let us pick our avatars, so...

290
00:20:27,384 --> 00:20:29,217
- Because it's busted!
- Yeah, okay.

291
00:20:29,351 --> 00:20:30,683
Are we dead?

292
00:20:30,817 --> 00:20:33,451
You know, I was just
wondering the same thing.

293
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,418
Did I die and turn into

294
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:38,884
some kind of a small,
muscular Boy Scout?

295
00:20:39,017 --> 00:20:42,017
- We're not dead.
- So then what's going on here?

296
00:20:42,151 --> 00:20:44,284
Okay, this is gonna sound
very, uh, strange,

297
00:20:44,418 --> 00:20:47,384
but we are in
a video game called <i>Jumanji,</i>

298
00:20:47,518 --> 00:20:52,017
and we are in the bodies
of video game characters, heh.

299
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:54,017
And we've been here before,
Fridge and I.

300
00:20:54,151 --> 00:20:55,850
- Last time, I was you.
- Mm.

301
00:20:55,984 --> 00:20:58,583
- Huh?
- We're in a game!

302
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:00,850
We gotta find Spencer
'cause he's in here too.

303
00:21:00,984 --> 00:21:03,051
- Spencer?
- Yes.

304
00:21:03,184 --> 00:21:04,917
- He's here?
- Yes.

305
00:21:05,051 --> 00:21:06,650
Spencer, Eddie's grandson?

306
00:21:06,784 --> 00:21:08,550
Yes. Spencer.

307
00:21:08,683 --> 00:21:10,917
- He's here too?
- Yes!

308
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:12,550
He's here,
and we gotta find him.

309
00:21:12,683 --> 00:21:15,051
So it's like
a hide-and-go-seek situation.

310
00:21:16,117 --> 00:21:17,650
I'm not "it."

311
00:21:17,784 --> 00:21:19,017
Hm...

312
00:21:22,317 --> 00:21:24,084
My hip feels
pretty good now.

313
00:21:27,084 --> 00:21:29,384
Oh, my joints
feel like butter.

314
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,084
- Oh, yeah, look at those.
- Wow.

315
00:21:33,217 --> 00:21:36,351
Look at these.
Look at what I got.

316
00:21:36,484 --> 00:21:39,850
- Uh, we have some issues here.
- You're telling me this?

317
00:21:39,984 --> 00:21:41,617
I'm the old fat dude.

318
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,884
I came back, and things
actually got worse.

319
00:21:44,017 --> 00:21:45,850
At least last time
I was still black.

320
00:21:48,884 --> 00:21:51,950
Well, look at
this little fella.

321
00:21:52,084 --> 00:21:53,617
Hello there. Heh.

322
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,917
Mr. Walker, don't get
too close to the water!

323
00:21:56,051 --> 00:21:58,917
- Get away from there!
- I'm sorry, what'd you say now?

324
00:22:03,351 --> 00:22:05,051
Hey! Ahh!

325
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,384
Get on out of here!

326
00:22:10,051 --> 00:22:11,251
What just happened?

327
00:22:11,384 --> 00:22:12,750
What the hell
was that thing?

328
00:22:15,984 --> 00:22:22,550
Well, that there
was a hippopotamus. Mm-hm.

329
00:22:22,683 --> 00:22:24,484
And they are awfully fast.

330
00:22:24,617 --> 00:22:27,351
Faster than a horse,
if you can believe that.

331
00:22:27,484 --> 00:22:30,917
And they've got
an awful ferocious bite.

332
00:22:31,051 --> 00:22:33,683
How about that?
You know, the funny thing is,

333
00:22:33,817 --> 00:22:35,950
I don't remember...

334
00:22:36,084 --> 00:22:39,550
knowing much about hippos
until right now.

335
00:22:39,683 --> 00:22:41,084
You're a zoologist.

336
00:22:41,217 --> 00:22:44,884
- I'm sorry, what now?
- Are we in Florida?

337
00:22:45,017 --> 00:22:48,750
Just listen.
This is a dangerous place.

338
00:22:48,884 --> 00:22:50,117
Crazy dangerous.

339
00:22:50,251 --> 00:22:52,217
But Martha and I,
we've been here before.

340
00:22:52,351 --> 00:22:56,583
We know what we're doing. You
gotta stay alert all the time.

341
00:22:56,717 --> 00:23:00,717
If I'm near water, I got one eye
on the water, you hear me?

342
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,251
You got to have eyes
in the back of your...

343
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,683
Oh, God.

344
00:23:09,817 --> 00:23:13,384
What in the Sam Hill
just happened to him?

345
00:23:19,151 --> 00:23:21,351
Shut the front door.

346
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:22,850
What the hell
happened to you?

347
00:23:25,017 --> 00:23:26,084
Damn!

348
00:23:29,184 --> 00:23:30,184
A plane?

349
00:23:31,217 --> 00:23:34,384
What? Come on! Follow me!

350
00:23:34,518 --> 00:23:36,418
Come on, let's go.
Let's go. Follow us.

351
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,550
Welcome to Jumanji.

352
00:23:46,683 --> 00:23:48,784
- Why is he in a plane?
- I don't know.

353
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:50,950
Well, don't just stand there.
Hop in!

354
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:57,950
Strap in.
There's no time to spare.

355
00:24:01,884 --> 00:24:04,317
Dr. Bravestone,
famed archeologist

356
00:24:04,451 --> 00:24:06,217
and international explorer,

357
00:24:06,351 --> 00:24:08,017
I'm so glad you've returned.

358
00:24:08,151 --> 00:24:10,817
I've been so anxious
for your arrival.

359
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,317
- You talking to me?
- Yes.

360
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,583
Once again, Jumanji
is in great peril,

361
00:24:14,717 --> 00:24:15,917
and only you can help.

362
00:24:16,051 --> 00:24:17,717
Nigel, we're looking
for our friend.

363
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,917
- Have you seen, like, anyone...?
- Ruby Roundhouse, killer of men,

364
00:24:21,051 --> 00:24:22,850
welcome to Jumanji.

365
00:24:22,984 --> 00:24:26,583
- "Killer of men"?
- Yeah, I, uh... I kill guys.

366
00:24:26,717 --> 00:24:28,351
I'm so glad you've returned.

367
00:24:28,484 --> 00:24:30,583
I've been so anxious
for your arrival.

368
00:24:30,717 --> 00:24:33,184
- What's with this fella?
- My dearest Mouse,

369
00:24:33,317 --> 00:24:34,617
surely you remember me.

370
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,418
Nigel Billingsly
at your service.

371
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:39,518
Hey. Nigel,
I thought that was you.

372
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,717
He's a... Uh, what is it called?

373
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:45,051
- NPC, a non-player character.
- He's not a real person.

374
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:47,784
He only has a limited
number of things he can say.

375
00:24:47,917 --> 00:24:50,418
Mm, my friend Carl
is just like that.

376
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,051
Nigel, we're looking
for someone.

377
00:24:52,184 --> 00:24:53,617
Has anyone arrived
in Jumanji...?

378
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,384
Jumanji is in great peril.

379
00:24:55,518 --> 00:24:58,284
It's all detailed in the letter
I sent you, Dr. Bravestone.

380
00:24:58,418 --> 00:25:00,683
Perhaps you should
read it aloud.

381
00:25:00,817 --> 00:25:02,284
Grandpa Eddie.

382
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:04,683
- Do you have a letter?
- Do I have a letter?

383
00:25:04,817 --> 00:25:07,184
- Check your pockets.
- Why would I have a letter?

384
00:25:07,317 --> 00:25:08,750
Nigel here
wrote you a letter.

385
00:25:08,884 --> 00:25:10,518
I didn't get a letter
from this guy.

386
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,418
But we are
in a video game, and...

387
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,418
We're in a video game?

388
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,583
We're gonna die.

389
00:25:15,717 --> 00:25:17,650
- We did die.
- Are we in hell?

390
00:25:17,784 --> 00:25:19,151
- I knew it.
- Oh, my God.

391
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,051
It's detailed
in the letter I sent you,

392
00:25:21,184 --> 00:25:23,084
Dr. Bravestone.
You should read it aloud.

393
00:25:23,217 --> 00:25:26,084
I don't have a letter! How many
times I gotta tell you that?

394
00:25:26,217 --> 00:25:28,650
Oh, no, Eddie.
It's in your hand.

395
00:25:30,284 --> 00:25:31,750
Where did this come from?

396
00:25:31,884 --> 00:25:34,984
You got to pay attention
to what's in your hand.

397
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:37,451
Perhaps you should
read it aloud.

398
00:25:40,051 --> 00:25:42,884
"Dr. Bravestone,
it is my solemn hope

399
00:25:43,017 --> 00:25:46,084
that this letter finds you,
for again..."

400
00:25:46,217 --> 00:25:49,850
<i>Jumanji is in grave danger.
We need your help at once.</i>

401
00:25:49,984 --> 00:25:51,784
<i>Whoa, what's going on here?</i>

402
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,084
<i>It's a cutscene.
It's how we find...</i>

403
00:25:54,217 --> 00:25:55,451
<i>I'll explain afterwards.</i>

404
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:57,284
<i>You see, our worst nightmare</i>

405
00:25:57,418 --> 00:25:58,784
<i>has come to pass,</i>

406
00:25:58,917 --> 00:26:01,917
<i>for Jurgen the Brutal
has returned.</i>

407
00:26:02,051 --> 00:26:05,251
<i>Indeed, that most vicious
Jumanjian conqueror is back.</i>

408
00:26:06,418 --> 00:26:07,583
<i>And he's brought with him</i>

409
00:26:07,717 --> 00:26:09,518
<i>his savage horde.</i>

410
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:13,384
<i>They descended from their
fortress atop Mount Zhatmire</i>

411
00:26:13,518 --> 00:26:17,518
<i>and made their way south
to the Avian Province,</i>

412
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:20,251
<i>home of the sacred
Falcon Jewel,</i>

413
00:26:20,384 --> 00:26:22,650
<i>worn around the neck
of the village elder.</i>

414
00:26:22,784 --> 00:26:25,051
<i>The Falcon is
the fertility jewel of Jumanji,</i>

415
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:26,917
<i>and it has been guarded
by the people</i>

416
00:26:27,051 --> 00:26:29,850
<i>of the Avian Province
for hundreds of years.</i>

417
00:26:29,984 --> 00:26:32,151
<i>So long as the jewel
can see the sun,</i>

418
00:26:32,284 --> 00:26:35,850
<i>the waters will flow
and the land will flourish.</i>

419
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,884
Yeah!

420
00:26:52,518 --> 00:26:55,351
<i>Many brave souls died that day,</i>

421
00:26:55,484 --> 00:26:57,950
<i>but Jurgen got
what he came for.</i>

422
00:26:58,084 --> 00:27:00,384
<i>He stowed the jewel
in darkness,</i>

423
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:02,184
<i>hidden from the sun.</i>

424
00:27:14,117 --> 00:27:15,717
<i>A drought befell the land.</i>

425
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,917
<i>The crops dried out and died.</i>

426
00:27:18,051 --> 00:27:20,184
<i>And if the jewel
is not returned soon,</i>

427
00:27:20,317 --> 00:27:22,051
<i>it may be too late.</i>

428
00:27:22,184 --> 00:27:23,650
<i>Which is why we called for you</i>

429
00:27:23,784 --> 00:27:25,650
<i>and your brilliant associates.</i>

430
00:27:25,784 --> 00:27:27,384
<i>I understand
the enormous weight</i>

431
00:27:27,518 --> 00:27:29,750
<i>that this must carry for you,
Dr. Bravestone,</i>

432
00:27:29,884 --> 00:27:32,550
<i>how this adventure
is like no other,</i>

433
00:27:32,683 --> 00:27:35,151
<i>since it was Jurgen the Brutal</i>

434
00:27:35,284 --> 00:27:37,484
<i>who killed your parents.</i>

435
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,117
No, no, no, no!

436
00:27:44,717 --> 00:27:46,184
- Huh?
- He killed

437
00:27:46,317 --> 00:27:48,217
- Dr. Bravestone's parents?
- Indeed, he did.

438
00:27:48,351 --> 00:27:51,683
- When the doctor was just a boy.
- Oh, well, that's terrible.

439
00:27:51,817 --> 00:27:54,717
I can't say this enough:
We're in a video game.

440
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:57,418
You must recover the jewel
from Jurgen the Brutal

441
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,017
and show it to the sun.

442
00:27:59,151 --> 00:28:01,884
He's making his way north
across the desert now.

443
00:28:02,017 --> 00:28:04,850
Jurgen the Brutal.
Is that Barbara's boy?

444
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:07,217
And remember, the goal
is to recover the loot.

445
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:09,217
To wrest it from
the hands of the brute.

446
00:28:09,351 --> 00:28:10,884
And if you wish
to leave the game,

447
00:28:11,017 --> 00:28:13,317
you must save Jumanji
and call out its name.

448
00:28:13,451 --> 00:28:16,817
Excuse me. Who is Jumanji?

449
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:20,351
Well, if I was listening
correctly, that is her sister.

450
00:28:20,484 --> 00:28:21,884
Here's your map.

451
00:28:23,617 --> 00:28:26,351
Find an oasis and follow
the flame to the desert fruit.

452
00:28:26,484 --> 00:28:28,317
- Huh?
- I can't land here,

453
00:28:28,451 --> 00:28:30,017
so you're going
to have to drop in.

454
00:28:30,151 --> 00:28:31,550
- What?
- No, no. Nigel...

455
00:28:31,683 --> 00:28:33,251
- I'll get as low as I can.
- Hold on.

456
00:28:33,384 --> 00:28:34,717
- Get ready.
- What do you mean?

457
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:35,717
We don't have parachutes.

458
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,151
Shouldn't we have...? Ahh!

459
00:28:37,284 --> 00:28:39,051
- What the hell?
- Good luck.

460
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:41,017
The future of Jumanji
is in your hands.

461
00:28:41,151 --> 00:28:43,017
Why did we take a plane
if there's nowhere to land?

462
00:28:43,151 --> 00:28:44,217
And go!

463
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:14,084
The hell, man?

464
00:29:25,317 --> 00:29:26,384
Where are we?

465
00:29:26,518 --> 00:29:28,151
Where's the jungle?

466
00:29:28,284 --> 00:29:30,051
What are we doing here?

467
00:29:30,184 --> 00:29:32,051
We've got to keep it
together, okay?

468
00:29:32,184 --> 00:29:33,518
- "Keep it together"?
- Yes.

469
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,051
This is
a whole new thing.

470
00:29:35,184 --> 00:29:37,317
Nobody said we'd have to do
a whole new thing.

471
00:29:37,451 --> 00:29:40,217
And by the way, what the hell
happened to Bethany?

472
00:30:00,683 --> 00:30:03,217
So, what part of New
Hampshire is this exactly?

473
00:30:03,351 --> 00:30:05,384
We're not
in New Hampshire, Milo.

474
00:30:05,518 --> 00:30:07,418
That's right. Exactly.
Not New Hampshire.

475
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,418
- You're starting to get it now?
- Nope.

476
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:12,017
I don't have the foggiest clue
what's going on here.

477
00:30:12,151 --> 00:30:14,184
That guy kept calling me
Dr. Braverman,

478
00:30:14,317 --> 00:30:15,950
which is the name
of my orthopedist.

479
00:30:16,084 --> 00:30:18,351
I'm thinking I just had
another hip surgery

480
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:20,017
and now I'm coming out of it.

481
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:23,084
Hey! Check this out!

482
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:31,251
Okay.
We have to find Spencer.

483
00:30:31,384 --> 00:30:34,051
To do that, I think we have
to start playing the game.

484
00:30:34,184 --> 00:30:36,817
I'm sure that's what he did.
We find him,

485
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:39,650
finish the game,
and we go home.

486
00:30:39,784 --> 00:30:42,184
Ed, you okay?

487
00:30:42,317 --> 00:30:45,084
Would you look at me?

488
00:30:45,217 --> 00:30:47,084
I'm back.

489
00:30:47,217 --> 00:30:49,084
I haven't looked
like this since...

490
00:30:49,217 --> 00:30:50,518
Never.

491
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,717
You looked like this never.

492
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,084
What? When I was younger,
I was in great shape.

493
00:30:55,217 --> 00:30:57,051
I remember you
when you were younger,

494
00:30:57,184 --> 00:31:00,384
and... this is not
what you looked like.

495
00:31:00,518 --> 00:31:02,550
I think my eyes
are a different color.

496
00:31:02,683 --> 00:31:04,917
All of you
is a different color.

497
00:31:05,051 --> 00:31:08,850
It's a good look on me,
huh? Huh?

498
00:31:08,984 --> 00:31:11,251
Okay.
They're headed north.

499
00:31:11,384 --> 00:31:13,617
- Which way is north?
- I have no idea.

500
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:17,384
- Well, you wanna check the map?
- Right. I'm the map guy now.

501
00:31:17,518 --> 00:31:21,484
"Find an oasis and follow
the flame to the desert fruit."

502
00:31:21,617 --> 00:31:24,351
Follow the flame
to the desert fruit.

503
00:31:24,484 --> 00:31:25,984
You know there's
nothing on that?

504
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:27,317
He can see it,
you can't.

505
00:31:27,451 --> 00:31:29,418
Each place on the map
is a different level,

506
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,884
and the levels
get harder as we go.

507
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:33,917
This one is called...

508
00:31:34,051 --> 00:31:36,084
"Dunes."

509
00:31:36,217 --> 00:31:37,850
No shit.

510
00:31:40,217 --> 00:31:42,384
Who the hell is that?

511
00:31:47,117 --> 00:31:49,484
Oh, that's an ostrich.

512
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:53,418
- Oh, no.
- Yes, indeed.

513
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:57,184
That is an ostrich.

514
00:31:57,317 --> 00:32:00,251
The ostrich
is a flightless bird,

515
00:32:00,384 --> 00:32:02,617
one of 60 species.

516
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:06,683
You got the penguin, you got
the emu, and you got the kiwi.

517
00:32:06,817 --> 00:32:09,717
Heh, heh, funny thing is,
I don't remember knowing...

518
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,384
You're a zoologist.

519
00:32:11,518 --> 00:32:13,550
I was a zoologist last time.
It's important.

520
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:15,850
Maybe if we could get through
this quicker.

521
00:32:15,984 --> 00:32:20,884
Well, another thing is, they can
run up to 45 miles per hour,

522
00:32:21,017 --> 00:32:24,650
which makes them the world's
fastest two-legged animal.

523
00:32:24,784 --> 00:32:27,384
Did you know that?
Fascinating.

524
00:32:29,217 --> 00:32:32,750
- What a magnificent creature.
- We should get out of here.

525
00:32:34,117 --> 00:32:36,017
What else do you know?

526
00:32:36,151 --> 00:32:37,717
Here's another
interesting fact.

527
00:32:39,217 --> 00:32:41,717
They have three stomachs.
How about that?

528
00:32:43,017 --> 00:32:46,251
Ah! Come on.
Beat it!

529
00:32:46,384 --> 00:32:48,017
Don't get so close.

530
00:32:48,151 --> 00:32:51,418
Just a bird, okay? Come on,
get moving. Get out of here.

531
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,850
- Anything else we need to know?
- Beat it, bird.

532
00:32:53,984 --> 00:32:56,251
Another interesting thing
about the ostrich...

533
00:32:56,384 --> 00:32:58,351
I said scram,
you stupid bird!

534
00:32:58,484 --> 00:33:00,518
- ...is when threatened...
- Get out of here!

535
00:33:00,683 --> 00:33:02,117
...they attack.

536
00:33:04,717 --> 00:33:06,518
Oh, my!

537
00:33:08,518 --> 00:33:10,217
- Eddie! Eddie!
- Oh!

538
00:33:10,351 --> 00:33:12,850
Where's Eddie? Is he dead?

539
00:33:12,984 --> 00:33:14,518
- Yes.
- No. Yes, he died,

540
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,384
but he's fine.

541
00:33:16,518 --> 00:33:19,418
Did I just kill Eddie...

542
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,418
by talking too slow...

543
00:33:22,984 --> 00:33:24,484
like he always said
I would?

544
00:33:35,717 --> 00:33:39,583
Why does everybody keep
dropping from the sky?

545
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:44,017
Nurse, I'm gonna need to see
Dr. Braverman right now, please.

546
00:33:44,151 --> 00:33:46,484
I'm not your nurse.
Okay, listen.

547
00:33:46,617 --> 00:33:50,817
These tattoos on our arms,
that is your life count.

548
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,251
We each have three lives.

549
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:54,850
You and Fridge
each have two left.

550
00:33:54,984 --> 00:33:56,518
If you lose all three,

551
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,284
listen to me,
it is game over.

552
00:33:59,418 --> 00:34:03,518
- That's it. You're dead.
- Dead like... "kaputski"?

553
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:04,950
Yes.

554
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,251
Kaputski.

555
00:34:11,518 --> 00:34:12,617
What the hell is that?

556
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,451
- That's not good.
- Look.

557
00:34:23,184 --> 00:34:26,484
Oh, there's one more thing
about ostriches.

558
00:34:26,617 --> 00:34:27,550
Oh, no.

559
00:34:27,683 --> 00:34:28,750
Say it!

560
00:34:28,884 --> 00:34:31,184
They travel in herds.

561
00:34:36,217 --> 00:34:37,817
We gotta get out of here!

562
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,484
- Dune buggies, let's go!
- Come on, come on! Shake a leg!

563
00:34:40,617 --> 00:34:42,117
- Hey, wait.
- Why am I so slow?

564
00:34:42,251 --> 00:34:43,717
Haul ass, girl. Let's go!

565
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,484
- Come on, come on!
- I'm coming, Eddie.

566
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:47,317
- Go.
- Do you see the key anywhere?

567
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:50,084
- Okay, how do I do this?
- I've never driven one of these!

568
00:34:54,284 --> 00:34:55,850
Maybe under the dash.

569
00:34:57,184 --> 00:34:59,184
- Green button!
- Green button. Go.

570
00:34:59,317 --> 00:35:00,184
Go, go, go!

571
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:03,950
Go, go.

572
00:35:13,384 --> 00:35:14,451
Oh, my God!

573
00:35:27,217 --> 00:35:28,317
Go.

574
00:35:28,451 --> 00:35:31,351
You are
a terrible driver.

575
00:35:31,484 --> 00:35:33,251
What are you talking about?
We're fine.

576
00:35:33,384 --> 00:35:35,583
Nobody fine. You... Oh! Oh, oh!

577
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,984
Oh, no! Ahh, ahh!

578
00:35:39,117 --> 00:35:41,351
Oh, help! Oh, oh!

579
00:35:41,484 --> 00:35:43,384
Hold on, Eddie.
Please don't let go.

580
00:35:43,518 --> 00:35:46,384
Ahh! Oh! Oh, wow!

581
00:35:46,518 --> 00:35:48,017
Oh, help. Ahh!

582
00:35:54,351 --> 00:35:57,184
Help. Eddie. Oh!

583
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,518
Beat it!

584
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:03,784
Get out of here!

585
00:36:08,184 --> 00:36:09,117
I think we lost them.

586
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:10,251
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

587
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:28,284
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

588
00:36:31,017 --> 00:36:32,251
Oh, no.

589
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:38,550
- Ahh!
- What do we do?

590
00:36:38,683 --> 00:36:40,384
I don't know!

591
00:36:44,117 --> 00:36:45,884
Get in! Hurry!

592
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,384
Ha! Suckers!

593
00:37:05,717 --> 00:37:07,117
- Eddie...
- Uh-oh.

594
00:37:09,084 --> 00:37:12,518
- Oh, my...
- Whoa, whoa!

595
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:15,518
- Oh, dude!
- Oh, dear.

596
00:37:17,884 --> 00:37:20,084
What do we do?

597
00:37:20,217 --> 00:37:21,217
What do we do?

598
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:26,784
What are you doing?

599
00:37:26,917 --> 00:37:30,184
- Birds, birds, birds!
- Birds!

600
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:40,717
- What the hell, man?
- They're flightless birds.

601
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:44,217
This is a flightless
dune buggy!

602
00:37:44,351 --> 00:37:47,051
- Oh!
- Oh, no!

603
00:37:49,217 --> 00:37:50,817
No, no, no!

604
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:53,184
- We're not going to make it.
- We're gonna make it.

605
00:37:53,317 --> 00:37:55,384
- No, we're not!
- We're not gonna make it.

606
00:37:55,518 --> 00:37:56,683
We're gonna make it.

607
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,583
We're not gonna make it.

608
00:38:15,217 --> 00:38:18,850
That was fantastic. Heh.

609
00:38:18,984 --> 00:38:20,550
- Oh, horrible driver.
- Whoo...

610
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:25,850
Yeah, you see that, birds?
You don't mess with the kid.

611
00:38:25,984 --> 00:38:27,251
Right there!

612
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,117
Did you see me?

613
00:38:33,251 --> 00:38:34,884
I was incredible.

614
00:38:35,017 --> 00:38:37,251
I mean, I saved you,
I saved you,

615
00:38:37,384 --> 00:38:41,817
I saved this guy from a bird
while I was driving a car.

616
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:44,917
I was a machine.
I was relentless.

617
00:38:45,051 --> 00:38:48,151
- I was fearless.
- Yes. Exactly. Fearless.

618
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:51,384
That's Bravestone.
Okay, check this out.

619
00:38:53,518 --> 00:38:54,884
Oh, goodness.

620
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,683
What the hell?

621
00:38:57,817 --> 00:38:59,384
It's your strengths
and weaknesses.

622
00:38:59,518 --> 00:39:00,817
I... I mean your avatar,

623
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:03,850
Dr. Bravestone's,
strengths and weaknesses.

624
00:39:03,984 --> 00:39:05,717
"Fearless," check.

625
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:08,251
"Speed. Climbing."
"Boomerang"?

626
00:39:09,518 --> 00:39:11,217
"Smoldering intensity"?

627
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:14,084
- It's this stupid face you make.
- Huh?

628
00:39:17,683 --> 00:39:18,784
There it is.

629
00:39:20,151 --> 00:39:22,950
Ew! Ew! Old man.
Get it together.

630
00:39:23,084 --> 00:39:26,051
Eddie, you okay?
You having a heart attack?

631
00:39:26,184 --> 00:39:28,950
His whole left side is shutting
down. Eddie, look at me!

632
00:39:29,084 --> 00:39:31,683
- Yeah?
- There you go. Now you're back.

633
00:39:33,184 --> 00:39:35,217
"Weakness: switchblade."

634
00:39:35,351 --> 00:39:37,717
Switchblade? Hey, that's new.

635
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,884
Bravestone didn't
have weaknesses last time.

636
00:39:40,017 --> 00:39:41,750
Yeah,
bugged the hell out of me.

637
00:39:41,884 --> 00:39:43,418
I wonder if...

638
00:39:48,217 --> 00:39:51,817
- "Nunchucks"? That's new.
- Damn, that's a good list.

639
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:54,884
Milo, push on your left,
like, chest area.

640
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,750
- I'm sorry, what?
- Come on, man.

641
00:39:57,884 --> 00:39:59,317
Hey!

642
00:39:59,451 --> 00:40:01,518
Oh, I got one too. What...?

643
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:06,051
My. "Zoology." That's what
you were talking about earlier.

644
00:40:06,184 --> 00:40:07,351
- Yes. Exactly.
- Yes.

645
00:40:07,484 --> 00:40:09,084
Your avatar is a zoologist.

646
00:40:09,217 --> 00:40:13,017
You know, my nephew Maxwell
is a veterinarian.

647
00:40:13,151 --> 00:40:15,284
- What a fascinating...
- "Linguistics"?

648
00:40:15,418 --> 00:40:18,084
- I didn't have that last time.
- The study of languages.

649
00:40:18,217 --> 00:40:20,683
Makes sense.
He studies the entire language

650
00:40:20,817 --> 00:40:22,284
on his way to the point.

651
00:40:22,418 --> 00:40:25,550
Anyway, he's 32. Or is he 35?

652
00:40:25,683 --> 00:40:26,850
Time does fly.

653
00:40:26,984 --> 00:40:28,550
Okay, let's get it over with.

654
00:40:33,017 --> 00:40:34,550
You gotta be kidding me.

655
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:37,017
Well, geometry is...

656
00:40:37,151 --> 00:40:38,550
- Is new.
- Yeah.

657
00:40:38,683 --> 00:40:40,750
Who wouldn't wanna
be better at geometry?

658
00:40:40,884 --> 00:40:43,151
And for weaknesses,
"Endurance."

659
00:40:43,284 --> 00:40:47,084
And what else? Let's see,
"Heat, sun and sand."

660
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,750
Shouldn't be a problem.
It's not like

661
00:40:51,884 --> 00:40:55,017
we're in the middle of
a goddamn desert or anything.

662
00:40:55,151 --> 00:40:57,717
What's the point of this guy?
Who even needs this guy?

663
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:59,051
He can read the map.

664
00:40:59,184 --> 00:41:01,084
Easy for you to say,
you got nunchucks!

665
00:41:01,217 --> 00:41:04,418
I've been training four hours
a day for six months.

666
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,317
Now look at me!

667
00:41:06,451 --> 00:41:08,917
Man, it is hot out here!

668
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:13,784
How is this guy a character
in an adventure game?

669
00:41:13,917 --> 00:41:15,518
Okay, okay, okay.

670
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:18,550
I gotta get this guy in shape
and build up some endurance.

671
00:41:18,683 --> 00:41:19,784
I know how to do that.

672
00:41:19,917 --> 00:41:21,518
Burpees.
Five burpees, right now.

673
00:41:21,683 --> 00:41:22,917
Get it going!

674
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:27,750
- That's one.
- One!

675
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:35,850
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah, come on!

676
00:41:38,151 --> 00:41:40,518
North is that way!

677
00:41:53,518 --> 00:41:54,850
You know, it's, uh...

678
00:41:54,984 --> 00:41:56,984
It's really good
to see you, Ed.

679
00:41:57,117 --> 00:41:58,518
I don't wanna hear it.

680
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:00,850
You don't wanna hear
that it's good to see you?

681
00:42:00,984 --> 00:42:04,550
- You sold me out, Milo.
- I did not sell you out.

682
00:42:04,683 --> 00:42:06,750
We sold our business.
It was time.

683
00:42:06,884 --> 00:42:09,750
- Yeah, time for who?
- Well, it was time for me.

684
00:42:09,884 --> 00:42:11,683
Okay? Standing on my feet,

685
00:42:11,817 --> 00:42:14,184
serving a hundred plates
a night for 35 years?

686
00:42:14,317 --> 00:42:16,117
I was done.

687
00:42:16,251 --> 00:42:18,084
I was ready, man.

688
00:42:18,217 --> 00:42:19,917
I was ready to retire.

689
00:42:20,051 --> 00:42:21,284
I'm done talking!

690
00:42:36,384 --> 00:42:37,850
"The Oasis."

691
00:42:40,418 --> 00:42:42,251
I guess
that's the next level.

692
00:42:44,484 --> 00:42:45,683
Huh?

693
00:42:46,884 --> 00:42:48,984
The next level
of the game.

694
00:42:49,117 --> 00:42:50,351
We're in
a game?

695
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,583
Oh. Yes, Grandpa Eddie,
we are in a game.

696
00:42:52,717 --> 00:42:53,984
You can't be
serious.

697
00:42:54,117 --> 00:42:55,484
Did you know
about this?

698
00:42:55,617 --> 00:42:57,550
I thought
you were done talking.

699
00:43:09,683 --> 00:43:11,583
- Bethany?
- Yep.

700
00:43:12,884 --> 00:43:15,217
- My name's Bethany too.
- Really?

701
00:43:15,351 --> 00:43:17,451
Daddy, her name's Bethany too.

702
00:43:22,418 --> 00:43:24,384
Sure is, sweetie.

703
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,617
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

704
00:43:29,917 --> 00:43:31,518
Sure, yeah. Uh, come in.

705
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:33,784
I'm sorry, I just...

706
00:43:33,917 --> 00:43:35,351
I didn't know
where else to go.

707
00:43:35,484 --> 00:43:37,184
No, no, no, it's okay.

708
00:43:37,317 --> 00:43:38,884
I'm glad you came.

709
00:43:39,017 --> 00:43:42,217
Do you think you can help me
get the machine to start?

710
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,184
That is so dangerous.

711
00:43:47,317 --> 00:43:48,418
I know.

712
00:43:50,384 --> 00:43:51,917
But I have to try.

713
00:43:54,217 --> 00:43:55,518
They're my team.

714
00:44:08,884 --> 00:44:11,151
So, what exactly
are we looking for again?

715
00:44:11,284 --> 00:44:13,151
We're looking
for my grandson, genius.

716
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:16,550
Okay, "Follow the flame
to the desert fruit."

717
00:44:19,484 --> 00:44:20,583
Look.

718
00:44:22,384 --> 00:44:23,550
They're here.

719
00:44:23,683 --> 00:44:25,251
Hyenas.

720
00:44:25,384 --> 00:44:28,051
Unusual for
their bone-crushing teeth.

721
00:44:31,984 --> 00:44:33,850
Smoke Stack.

722
00:44:33,984 --> 00:44:35,617
Where's there's smoke...

723
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:37,850
There's fire.

724
00:44:37,984 --> 00:44:39,717
- Come on.
- Mm.

725
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:42,384
- Boom!
- You call that a roll?

726
00:44:42,518 --> 00:44:43,784
Not bad at all.

727
00:44:43,917 --> 00:44:45,251
I'll bet you two more!

728
00:44:45,384 --> 00:44:48,017
Drinks! Drinks over here!

729
00:44:48,151 --> 00:44:49,184
Another round here!

730
00:44:49,317 --> 00:44:50,884
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

731
00:45:11,217 --> 00:45:12,917
I thought
you'd never come back.

732
00:45:15,717 --> 00:45:17,351
I need to talk to you.

733
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,084
Absolutely.

734
00:45:22,217 --> 00:45:24,717
Not here, not now.

735
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,451
Not around them.

736
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:33,884
Leave me alone!

737
00:45:38,717 --> 00:45:39,750
Wow.

738
00:45:41,384 --> 00:45:42,583
Fiery.

739
00:45:42,717 --> 00:45:44,683
Not a real person.

740
00:45:44,817 --> 00:45:46,884
- What'd she say?
- Well, she said she thought

741
00:45:47,017 --> 00:45:49,884
I was never gonna come back,
she wants to get together later,

742
00:45:50,017 --> 00:45:52,583
- and we all know what that means.
- Hiyo!

743
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:54,683
It means that she's got
a clue for you.

744
00:45:54,817 --> 00:45:57,151
Oh, that's a coincidence.
I got a clue for her.

745
00:45:57,284 --> 00:45:58,884
- You got a clue for her.
- Wait.

746
00:45:59,017 --> 00:46:01,917
She's your ex-girlfriend.
She's the flame.

747
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:03,817
- "Follow the flame."
- What?

748
00:46:15,217 --> 00:46:17,084
The jewel, it's here.

749
00:46:33,184 --> 00:46:35,117
Is that the guy
that killed my parents?

750
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:37,683
No. Well, yeah. Kind of.

751
00:46:40,251 --> 00:46:42,518
We lost a good man today.

752
00:46:44,017 --> 00:46:45,351
The very best of us.

753
00:46:47,251 --> 00:46:49,217
For Dagfinn...

754
00:46:49,351 --> 00:46:51,550
wasn't just my hyena master.

755
00:46:52,884 --> 00:46:54,484
He was my friend.

756
00:46:54,617 --> 00:46:56,984
I loved him like a brother.

757
00:46:58,184 --> 00:47:01,217
And now he's gone.

758
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:04,017
And his beloved hyenas
are left...

759
00:47:04,151 --> 00:47:05,683
without their master.

760
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:11,317
Long live Dagfinn.

761
00:47:11,451 --> 00:47:14,317
Long live Dagfinn!

762
00:47:14,451 --> 00:47:16,717
Why did he have to die?

763
00:47:19,217 --> 00:47:21,418
He died because...

764
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:23,650
he made a mistake.

765
00:47:23,784 --> 00:47:27,184
He tried to steal something
quite precious from me.

766
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:31,017
He left me no choice.

767
00:47:31,151 --> 00:47:33,051
And now...

768
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:37,217
I feed him
to his beloved hyenas.

769
00:47:41,184 --> 00:47:42,917
- That's messed up.
- Oh!

770
00:47:43,051 --> 00:47:45,117
I loved Dagfinn!

771
00:47:46,917 --> 00:47:49,251
There's none among you
I love as much.

772
00:47:50,518 --> 00:47:51,950
And so...

773
00:47:57,017 --> 00:47:58,583
The key!

774
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:01,418
It's gone.

775
00:48:02,484 --> 00:48:04,650
Thief!

776
00:48:04,784 --> 00:48:07,317
I got her. I got the thief.

777
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,084
Wait.

778
00:48:09,217 --> 00:48:11,550
- Are you guys...? Wha...?
- Come here.

779
00:48:11,683 --> 00:48:14,184
- Catch her!
- Don't let her get away.

780
00:48:17,518 --> 00:48:19,984
Trying to steal
the key to my chest?

781
00:48:21,284 --> 00:48:23,051
Nope.

782
00:48:23,184 --> 00:48:24,217
Shake her down.

783
00:48:27,217 --> 00:48:28,917
I'm sorry, I did it.
It was my fault.

784
00:48:29,051 --> 00:48:30,583
I, uh...

785
00:48:32,017 --> 00:48:34,583
I just... I don't...

786
00:48:34,717 --> 00:48:37,750
I don't know what I was...
Oy vey.

787
00:48:37,884 --> 00:48:42,284
Uh, it's like, um...
It's like I'm hyperventilating.

788
00:48:42,418 --> 00:48:44,617
Does anyone have,
like, a eucalyptus inhaler?

789
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:46,451
Or a brown paper bag?

790
00:48:46,583 --> 00:48:47,518
Spencer?

791
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:49,017
Is it really hot in here?

792
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,583
You mean...?

793
00:48:50,717 --> 00:48:53,084
- That's him. Right there.
- What?

794
00:48:53,217 --> 00:48:56,251
That ain't Spencer.
Look, I know my grandson.

795
00:48:56,384 --> 00:48:57,484
My grandson's a guy.

796
00:48:59,017 --> 00:49:00,518
Did he change his hair?

797
00:49:01,683 --> 00:49:03,650
- Cut off her head.
- Yeah!

798
00:49:03,784 --> 00:49:05,717
- Cut off her head!
- Wait, wait, wait.

799
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:09,084
I just think, uh, maybe
don't cut off my head?

800
00:49:09,217 --> 00:49:10,084
- Oh!
- Spencer!

801
00:49:10,217 --> 00:49:11,518
- Oh, my.
- Did he just...?

802
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:12,583
Oh, Lord.

803
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:15,884
That's my Life Alert.

804
00:49:16,017 --> 00:49:17,484
I gotta take my pill.

805
00:49:24,284 --> 00:49:25,583
Come on!

806
00:49:27,451 --> 00:49:28,418
Spencer!

807
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:30,284
Oh, my God, you're alive.

808
00:49:30,418 --> 00:49:32,284
What are you guys doing here?

809
00:49:32,418 --> 00:49:35,117
What are we doing here?
We came to get you, fool!

810
00:49:35,251 --> 00:49:38,251
- Bethany?
- Not Bethany. Fridge, goddamn it!

811
00:49:38,384 --> 00:49:39,950
What? So, um...

812
00:49:40,084 --> 00:49:42,418
Milo Walker, darling.

813
00:49:44,484 --> 00:49:45,917
Milo?

814
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,717
- Spencer? Is that you, kiddo?
- Grandpa?

815
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:53,117
Guys, I found Spencer.
Here's Spencer right here.

816
00:49:53,251 --> 00:49:55,583
What are you stealing for?

817
00:49:55,717 --> 00:49:58,351
- I'm still me.
- Oh.

818
00:49:58,484 --> 00:49:59,418
Hey.

819
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:02,251
- Hey.
- Hey.

820
00:50:06,784 --> 00:50:07,750
Come on.

821
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:13,717
Let's go.

822
00:50:23,451 --> 00:50:26,217
Damn it, I was so close.
I had the key in my hand.

823
00:50:26,351 --> 00:50:28,550
- Why'd you stop me?
- Huh? Someone yelled "thief,"

824
00:50:28,683 --> 00:50:30,317
so I grabbed you.
What do you want?

825
00:50:30,451 --> 00:50:32,784
You shouldn't have come.
I had it under control.

826
00:50:32,917 --> 00:50:35,351
Did you? It looked like
you just got murdered.

827
00:50:35,484 --> 00:50:38,117
I mean, what the hell, Spencer?
Why are you even here?

828
00:50:38,251 --> 00:50:39,717
Why did you have the game?

829
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:43,184
We destroyed it
so that this would never happen!

830
00:50:43,317 --> 00:50:45,051
I went back and got it, okay?

831
00:50:45,184 --> 00:50:48,384
I don't know
why I did it, but I did.

832
00:50:48,518 --> 00:50:51,184
And then last night...

833
00:50:51,317 --> 00:50:52,884
I've been in kind
of a weird place,

834
00:50:53,017 --> 00:50:54,850
and something
came over me, okay?

835
00:50:54,984 --> 00:50:57,184
And now we're all
stuck here again!

836
00:50:57,317 --> 00:51:01,984
I thought that I would be him.
Bravestone!

837
00:51:02,117 --> 00:51:04,217
I wanted to feel
like that again.

838
00:51:06,284 --> 00:51:09,184
Like... I could do anything.

839
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:14,084
But instead, I'm, um...

840
00:51:14,217 --> 00:51:16,051
Ming Fleetfoot.

841
00:51:18,017 --> 00:51:20,583
"Cat burglar,
pickpocket, safecracker."

842
00:51:20,717 --> 00:51:22,384
Another better character.

843
00:51:22,518 --> 00:51:24,750
- "Weakness: pollen."
- Yeah.

844
00:51:24,884 --> 00:51:27,084
She's small and crafty
and has allergies.

845
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:28,317
She's basically me.

846
00:51:29,518 --> 00:51:31,484
I swear, man, if we survive,

847
00:51:31,617 --> 00:51:33,784
I am gonna kill you.

848
00:51:33,917 --> 00:51:36,617
I just can't believe
you came back here on purpose.

849
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:38,683
I'm sorry. Okay?

850
00:51:40,917 --> 00:51:42,451
I'm sorry.

851
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:44,950
Wait!

852
00:51:45,084 --> 00:51:46,518
Oh, there she is.

853
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:49,017
- Who?
- My ex.

854
00:51:49,151 --> 00:51:50,617
Okay.

855
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,017
Hi.

856
00:51:53,418 --> 00:51:56,251
If my husband knew
I was talking to you,

857
00:51:56,384 --> 00:51:58,518
you'd be dead by morning.

858
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:01,217
Uh, don't tell him?

859
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:03,683
Listen to me,
Jurgen and his army

860
00:52:03,817 --> 00:52:05,683
are returning to his fortress.

861
00:52:05,817 --> 00:52:09,017
There, they will meet
the Brothers Kababik.

862
00:52:09,151 --> 00:52:12,583
He will trade the Falcon Jewel,
and an alliance will be formed.

863
00:52:12,717 --> 00:52:16,217
You must get the jewel
before that happens.

864
00:52:16,351 --> 00:52:17,817
You're our only hope,

865
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:19,984
so you must hurry.

866
00:52:22,051 --> 00:52:23,217
Oh, my.

867
00:52:26,051 --> 00:52:27,650
- Now you must go.
- Gotta go.

868
00:52:27,784 --> 00:52:29,184
They're gonna meet
the Brothers who?

869
00:52:29,317 --> 00:52:30,683
The Brothers Kababik.

870
00:52:30,817 --> 00:52:32,750
- The Brothers Bababik.
- Shh!

871
00:52:32,884 --> 00:52:35,184
- Kababik?
- You must get the jewel

872
00:52:35,317 --> 00:52:36,583
before that happens.

873
00:52:36,717 --> 00:52:40,117
You are our only hope,
so you must hurry.

874
00:52:47,984 --> 00:52:50,451
I think you should explain it
to us one more time.

875
00:52:50,583 --> 00:52:52,117
- Wait a second.
- Oh!

876
00:52:52,251 --> 00:52:53,583
What about the desert fruit?

877
00:52:53,717 --> 00:52:54,917
Aren't you gonna
lead us to that?

878
00:52:55,051 --> 00:52:56,917
Now I must go...

879
00:52:57,051 --> 00:52:59,217
before Switchblade
realizes I'm gone.

880
00:53:00,917 --> 00:53:02,984
What? Switchblade?

881
00:53:03,117 --> 00:53:04,084
That's his weakness.

882
00:53:05,583 --> 00:53:08,051
I love you, Dr. Bravestone.

883
00:53:09,317 --> 00:53:11,418
And I always will.

884
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:13,351
That...

885
00:53:13,484 --> 00:53:15,550
is my curse.

886
00:53:19,117 --> 00:53:20,484
I love you too!

887
00:53:22,217 --> 00:53:24,351
Well, she seems
like a nice girl.

888
00:53:29,017 --> 00:53:31,051
We need camels.

889
00:53:31,184 --> 00:53:34,583
Okay, if we're gonna catch up
with Jurgen, we need camels.

890
00:53:34,717 --> 00:53:37,917
And we need to find the desert
fruit, whatever that is.

891
00:53:38,051 --> 00:53:40,518
"Follow the flame."
I guess we have to follow her.

892
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:43,184
You guys follow her,
we'll go steal some camels.

893
00:54:02,984 --> 00:54:04,217
Whoa.

894
00:54:30,817 --> 00:54:32,583
"Jumanji Berry Tree."

895
00:54:32,717 --> 00:54:34,583
Jumanji berry?

896
00:54:34,717 --> 00:54:37,151
That's a desert fruit?

897
00:54:37,284 --> 00:54:39,351
I guess.

898
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:43,451
"In the moment of need,
remember the seed."

899
00:54:43,583 --> 00:54:45,518
A little bit
of Jumanji wisdom there.

900
00:54:51,151 --> 00:54:52,284
There it is.

901
00:54:57,151 --> 00:54:59,351
Milo and I will break in
and get the camels.

902
00:54:59,484 --> 00:55:02,184
Grandpa, you stay here on
lookout. Keep a low profile.

903
00:55:02,317 --> 00:55:04,583
Got it? Low profile.

904
00:55:04,717 --> 00:55:06,550
If anyone tries
to enter the livery,

905
00:55:06,683 --> 00:55:09,217
just, I don't know,
whistle or something.

906
00:55:09,351 --> 00:55:10,717
Sure thing.

907
00:55:15,017 --> 00:55:16,451
That's not when you smolder.

908
00:55:16,583 --> 00:55:19,017
It's not the moment for it.
Forget it.

909
00:55:19,151 --> 00:55:20,717
I did it.
I don't know what it was.

910
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:22,984
Look like your stomach
is upset.

911
00:55:23,117 --> 00:55:24,750
Like you ate something bad.

912
00:55:27,351 --> 00:55:28,717
Oh, man.

913
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:31,351
I'm sweating. I'm sweating.

914
00:55:31,484 --> 00:55:33,184
Stealing makes me
very uncomfortable,

915
00:55:33,317 --> 00:55:36,518
which is not ideal
for a burglar.

916
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:00,917
So the fruit
is in the tree.

917
00:56:01,051 --> 00:56:02,251
But you can't get to it

918
00:56:02,384 --> 00:56:03,850
without going through
the water

919
00:56:03,984 --> 00:56:05,451
or whatever that is.

920
00:56:05,583 --> 00:56:08,418
Get boiled or eaten by piranhas
or something.

921
00:56:12,251 --> 00:56:13,683
"Follow the flame."

922
00:56:15,184 --> 00:56:17,418
I think that's how we get there.

923
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:20,683
But I don't know how
I'm supposed to make that jump.

924
00:56:20,817 --> 00:56:23,251
I mean, it's doable...

925
00:56:23,384 --> 00:56:25,750
but I don't have
my usual explosiveness.

926
00:56:26,817 --> 00:56:29,650
- Ugh!
- Wh... Ho! Yo!

927
00:56:29,784 --> 00:56:31,984
Ho, ho, ho! Wow!

928
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:41,850
Yes!

929
00:56:45,317 --> 00:56:47,583
Martha! Ho!

930
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:52,518
Martha!

931
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:53,850
Oh...

932
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:00,184
- Martha!
- Oh, it's really heavy.

933
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:04,251
Ugh! You okay?
Give me your hand.

934
00:57:04,384 --> 00:57:05,550
There you go.

935
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:15,583
Ow. Oh...

936
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:20,251
Wait a second.

937
00:57:20,384 --> 00:57:22,418
- What...?
- The hell, man?

938
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:24,384
Oh, my God!

939
00:57:24,518 --> 00:57:26,518
- The hell, man?
- Oh, my God.

940
00:57:29,217 --> 00:57:31,251
- Fridge?
- Yeah.

941
00:57:31,384 --> 00:57:33,151
Martha?

942
00:57:33,284 --> 00:57:34,583
Yeah.

943
00:57:40,683 --> 00:57:43,717
Hey, move along.
Nothing to see here.

944
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:44,917
What'd you say?

945
00:57:45,051 --> 00:57:46,550
I said, keep walking, pal.

946
00:57:46,683 --> 00:57:49,251
Nothing to see here. Beat it.

947
00:57:49,384 --> 00:57:53,518
- What'd you say?
- Beat it, get out of here.

948
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:54,917
What'd you say?

949
00:58:05,884 --> 00:58:07,017
I said, scram!

950
00:58:14,984 --> 00:58:19,051
You want a piece of me?
Yeah, come on, come on.

951
00:58:19,184 --> 00:58:21,484
What do you got?
What do you got? Come on!

952
00:58:22,717 --> 00:58:24,850
Come and get it. Yeah!

953
00:58:28,351 --> 00:58:30,317
Come on, you bastards!

954
00:58:31,384 --> 00:58:34,151
Ha, wow! Ha, ha!

955
00:58:34,284 --> 00:58:36,084
Here, camel, camel.

956
00:58:37,217 --> 00:58:38,583
Come on, let's go.

957
00:58:40,317 --> 00:58:43,351
They are proud and majestic
animals, aren't they?

958
00:58:47,451 --> 00:58:49,750
Oh, you're welcome. Heh.

959
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:55,850
Did you...? Were you
just talking to them?

960
00:58:55,984 --> 00:58:58,617
Um, press your menu.
Uh, it's right here.

961
00:59:01,317 --> 00:59:02,683
"Linguistics."

962
00:59:02,817 --> 00:59:04,451
You can talk to animals.

963
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:05,583
Yes.

964
00:59:05,717 --> 00:59:08,117
It appears that I speak camel.

965
00:59:08,251 --> 00:59:09,884
Can you ask them to
come with us and...?

966
00:59:11,317 --> 00:59:12,617
Excuse me.

967
00:59:14,351 --> 00:59:15,850
They're willing to talk.

968
00:59:15,984 --> 00:59:17,884
Uh, they wanna know
what's in it for them

969
00:59:18,017 --> 00:59:20,351
and how much luggage we have.

970
00:59:20,484 --> 00:59:23,884
Will you look at me? Oh!

971
00:59:24,017 --> 00:59:26,518
I mean, what am I supposed
to do with this?

972
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:28,084
You read the map.

973
00:59:28,217 --> 00:59:30,583
I don't wanna read the map.
I'm supposed to be her.

974
00:59:30,717 --> 00:59:33,650
Instead, there's actual hair
growing out of my face!

975
00:59:33,784 --> 00:59:38,084
Sorry. All bodies are beautiful,
even this one.

976
00:59:38,217 --> 00:59:39,817
Wait a second.

977
00:59:45,117 --> 00:59:49,084
- Oh, this is amazing!
- Careful.

978
00:59:49,217 --> 00:59:50,384
Fridge...

979
00:59:53,184 --> 00:59:56,117
Yo, this thing is insane!

980
00:59:56,251 --> 00:59:57,950
Be careful.
That body is not a toy.

981
00:59:58,084 --> 00:59:59,683
No, it's a machine.

982
00:59:59,817 --> 01:00:02,217
And on top of that...

983
01:00:02,351 --> 01:00:03,884
boobs.

984
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:05,884
Touch my boobs,
and I will murder you.

985
01:00:06,017 --> 01:00:08,351
Too late. It was literally
the first thing I did.

986
01:00:08,484 --> 01:00:09,750
Ew!

987
01:00:11,583 --> 01:00:14,184
Hey, hey, don't do that.

988
01:00:14,317 --> 01:00:16,084
Let's take this berry
and go meet them.

989
01:00:16,217 --> 01:00:17,750
Relax, girl.

990
01:00:17,884 --> 01:00:20,017
I'm trying that flying
acrobat thing you did.

991
01:00:20,151 --> 01:00:21,717
- Don't. We have the berry.
- Check this out.

992
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:23,384
- It's not necessary.
- Omaha, Omaha!

993
01:00:23,518 --> 01:00:25,084
- Hut, hut, hike!
- Wait.

994
01:00:27,717 --> 01:00:30,583
Fridge, be careful! I am telling
you, that body's a weapon.

995
01:00:30,717 --> 01:00:32,084
You don't know
what it's capable of.

996
01:00:32,217 --> 01:00:33,251
This is amazing!

997
01:00:33,384 --> 01:00:35,084
That body's a loaded gun!

998
01:00:35,217 --> 01:00:38,217
Yeah! And this gun's
about to go off!

999
01:00:38,351 --> 01:00:40,084
Whoo... Oh!

1000
01:00:40,217 --> 01:00:41,984
Oh, my God!

1001
01:00:42,117 --> 01:00:43,750
Fridge!

1002
01:00:43,884 --> 01:00:45,251
- Come here.
- Ugh!

1003
01:00:45,384 --> 01:00:48,084
Oh, my God.
Goddamn it!

1004
01:00:48,217 --> 01:00:50,484
- Here, I got you. I got ya.
- Ugh!

1005
01:01:02,084 --> 01:01:04,917
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no!

1006
01:01:05,051 --> 01:01:07,117
Oh, my God, that was awful.

1007
01:01:07,251 --> 01:01:09,184
I hate being the map guy!

1008
01:01:12,384 --> 01:01:13,850
Let's get out of here.

1009
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:21,850
Switchblade! There he is.

1010
01:01:23,284 --> 01:01:24,583
Bravestone!

1011
01:01:24,717 --> 01:01:27,084
I told you to stay
the hell away from my wife!

1012
01:01:31,117 --> 01:01:34,384
- We got company.
- What did you do?

1013
01:01:34,518 --> 01:01:37,051
All right, guys, this is
the moment. We need you now.

1014
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:44,717
Uh, they said that we can
get away out the back door.

1015
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:47,650
- Are you talking to that camel?
- Yes.

1016
01:01:47,784 --> 01:01:49,518
That's Lucille and Hank.

1017
01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:51,317
And Jeffrey's in the back.

1018
01:01:59,017 --> 01:02:00,617
- Hey!
- Hey.

1019
01:02:03,184 --> 01:02:04,950
- We should get going.
- What happened?

1020
01:02:05,084 --> 01:02:06,750
My grandpa beat up
45 strangers.

1021
01:02:06,884 --> 01:02:08,884
That woman's husband
is trying to kill him.

1022
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:10,351
Mm.

1023
01:02:10,484 --> 01:02:11,884
Is that the desert fruit?

1024
01:02:12,017 --> 01:02:13,518
Yeah. It's a Jumanji berry,

1025
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:15,850
and it weighs like 100 pounds.

1026
01:02:15,984 --> 01:02:17,084
My grandpa will carry it.

1027
01:02:20,418 --> 01:02:21,617
We should get out of here.

1028
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:23,583
Come on, Grandpa.
Let's go.

1029
01:02:23,717 --> 01:02:25,418
- I could take them.
- What?

1030
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:26,750
What? We escaped.

1031
01:02:26,884 --> 01:02:29,184
- I said, I could take them.
- Oh, Eddie.

1032
01:02:29,317 --> 01:02:31,317
No, Grandpa Eddie,
that's Switchblade!

1033
01:02:31,451 --> 01:02:33,518
I'm telling you,
there's a time when you run.

1034
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:35,917
Then there's a time in life,
like now, where you stay...

1035
01:02:41,717 --> 01:02:44,351
Yeah! Yeah!

1036
01:02:44,484 --> 01:02:45,750
<i>Switchblade! Switchblade!</i>

1037
01:02:45,884 --> 01:02:47,550
Nice shot, Switchblade!

1038
01:03:25,967 --> 01:03:27,034
- Oh!
- Phew.

1039
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:35,733
What?

1040
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:51,434
We should see
Mount Zhatmire pretty soon.

1041
01:03:53,867 --> 01:03:57,700
You know, Gladys and I took
a road trip before she passed.

1042
01:03:57,833 --> 01:04:00,167
We went on a ceramics tour

1043
01:04:00,301 --> 01:04:01,800
through the Southwest.

1044
01:04:01,934 --> 01:04:04,401
I lost my restaurant
so you could drive around

1045
01:04:04,534 --> 01:04:06,634
- and look at ashtrays?
- Yes, Ed.

1046
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,167
That's what you do
when you retire.

1047
01:04:09,301 --> 01:04:11,534
You explore your interests.

1048
01:04:11,668 --> 01:04:13,301
I don't have interests.

1049
01:04:13,434 --> 01:04:16,067
Guys like me, we don't retire!

1050
01:04:16,201 --> 01:04:18,201
We work,
and then we keep working,

1051
01:04:18,334 --> 01:04:20,034
and then, eventually, we die.

1052
01:04:20,167 --> 01:04:23,034
But you retired me.
You retired me.

1053
01:04:23,167 --> 01:04:25,568
It's a wonder I lasted
as long as I did.

1054
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:27,800
- What?
- You're a difficult man, Ed.

1055
01:04:27,934 --> 01:04:30,034
You don't abandon
your best friend, Milo.

1056
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:33,601
When I lost the restaurant,
I lost everything!

1057
01:04:33,733 --> 01:04:34,767
You...?

1058
01:04:35,967 --> 01:04:37,833
Yes. Yes, I know he is.

1059
01:04:37,967 --> 01:04:41,067
- Are you talking to my camel?
- Yes, I'm talking to the camel.

1060
01:04:41,201 --> 01:04:44,668
And he can tell
that you're a pain in the ass.

1061
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,100
My camel's taking your side?

1062
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:50,668
And he's not your camel.

1063
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,733
He's just giving you a ride.

1064
01:04:52,867 --> 01:04:56,833
Oh! Well, how about the both
of you go screw yourselves?

1065
01:04:56,967 --> 01:04:59,034
- What did you just say?
- Guys!

1066
01:04:59,167 --> 01:05:02,467
You and me, we gonna settle
this right here, right now!

1067
01:05:04,034 --> 01:05:05,700
- I'll show you.
- What are you doing?

1068
01:05:05,833 --> 01:05:08,733
- Don't worry about it.
- Milo, what are you doing?

1069
01:05:08,867 --> 01:05:11,467
Hold on. Wait, wait.
Here we go.

1070
01:05:15,668 --> 01:05:19,134
You want a piece of me, huh?
That's what you want?

1071
01:05:19,267 --> 01:05:21,800
You do not want a piece of him,
Milo, I'm telling you.

1072
01:05:21,934 --> 01:05:24,301
Oh, that's where
you're wrong, young man.

1073
01:05:24,434 --> 01:05:26,467
'Cause I do want a piece.

1074
01:05:26,601 --> 01:05:28,668
I want a big piece.

1075
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:33,833
See, Eddie, what you don't know
is that for the last 15 years,

1076
01:05:33,967 --> 01:05:36,267
I've been studying tai chi.

1077
01:05:36,401 --> 01:05:37,767
And right now,

1078
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,167
I am harnessing my chi.

1079
01:05:40,301 --> 01:05:43,367
And when I'm done,
I'm gonna whup your ass.

1080
01:05:43,501 --> 01:05:46,501
Milo, I am telling you,
this is not a good idea.

1081
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,234
No!

1082
01:05:58,201 --> 01:06:00,733
Oh, dude!

1083
01:06:00,867 --> 01:06:03,034
You gotta stop
killing everybody.

1084
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,668
All right, then.

1085
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,534
Well, I guess that's settled.

1086
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:29,967
The camels just stopped.

1087
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,833
This is as far as they go.

1088
01:06:35,967 --> 01:06:38,267
To get to Jurgen's fortress,
they said that we can

1089
01:06:38,401 --> 01:06:40,867
head down this path here
and make a right.

1090
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,501
Then we're in his territory.

1091
01:06:42,634 --> 01:06:44,000
And they don't wanna
go there

1092
01:06:44,134 --> 01:06:47,067
because they
don't want to die.

1093
01:06:47,201 --> 01:06:49,267
We don't wanna die either.

1094
01:06:54,134 --> 01:06:56,601
He's the worst Bravestone
of all time.

1095
01:07:31,334 --> 01:07:34,000
So we have to get
across... this.

1096
01:07:37,568 --> 01:07:40,267
Okay, we can do this.
We can do this.

1097
01:07:40,401 --> 01:07:42,733
We have to take our time,
make careful decisions.

1098
01:07:42,867 --> 01:07:44,733
What are you talking about?
It's obvious.

1099
01:07:44,867 --> 01:07:46,234
We start on that bridge there,

1100
01:07:46,367 --> 01:07:48,568
then jump to that one
that heads to the right,

1101
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:51,201
and then those look
like two sides of a trapezoid...

1102
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:56,000
Geometry.
That's what it's for!

1103
01:07:56,134 --> 01:07:58,334
Maybe this character's
not totally worthless.

1104
01:07:59,668 --> 01:08:01,434
- I'll go first.
- Really?

1105
01:08:06,534 --> 01:08:08,301
You see? It's no big deal.

1106
01:08:10,334 --> 01:08:11,501
Oh.
What's going on?

1107
01:08:11,634 --> 01:08:13,534
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Oh, no.

1108
01:08:16,167 --> 01:08:17,367
- No.
- Grandpa!

1109
01:08:21,034 --> 01:08:22,467
Ah, crap.

1110
01:08:23,867 --> 01:08:25,000
Ah, geez.

1111
01:08:26,634 --> 01:08:28,134
What the hell?

1112
01:08:31,534 --> 01:08:33,568
- It's okay. We can do this.
- Yeah?

1113
01:08:33,733 --> 01:08:35,401
It's about finding
the right timing.

1114
01:08:35,534 --> 01:08:37,301
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Follow me.

1115
01:08:42,467 --> 01:08:44,201
Come on!

1116
01:08:44,334 --> 01:08:46,034
Come on, Milo, come on!

1117
01:08:48,167 --> 01:08:51,267
Ah! Whoa! Whoa!

1118
01:08:51,401 --> 01:08:53,434
- Oh! Oh, Lord.
- Here.

1119
01:08:53,568 --> 01:08:55,067
Oh, okay.

1120
01:09:00,833 --> 01:09:02,067
Hey, you guys.

1121
01:09:02,201 --> 01:09:04,234
Is that rock... moving?

1122
01:09:09,634 --> 01:09:11,800
- Oh, no.
- What?

1123
01:09:11,934 --> 01:09:14,134
Well, now, this is a problem.

1124
01:09:14,267 --> 01:09:16,401
- Come on, what is it?
- Oh, my.

1125
01:09:16,534 --> 01:09:18,568
- Spit it out!
- What is it?

1126
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:21,700
- Tell us!
- Tell us! Milo!

1127
01:09:26,134 --> 01:09:27,800
Those are mandrills.

1128
01:09:27,934 --> 01:09:30,067
- We should go. Go, go!
- Go!

1129
01:09:34,167 --> 01:09:36,201
That one! Obtuse angle!

1130
01:09:38,301 --> 01:09:40,367
Note the distinctive
and colorful pigment

1131
01:09:40,501 --> 01:09:42,501
around their face and buttocks.

1132
01:09:46,234 --> 01:09:48,900
Mandrills are the heaviest
of all monkeys.

1133
01:09:49,034 --> 01:09:53,401
Even heavier than baboons, with
which they are often confused.

1134
01:09:56,067 --> 01:09:57,867
And now head for the rhombus!

1135
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,934
Come on. Hurry up.

1136
01:10:00,067 --> 01:10:01,334
- Rhombus! Rhombus!
- Come on.

1137
01:10:10,634 --> 01:10:12,167
No, Martha!

1138
01:10:12,301 --> 01:10:14,301
- You're on the wrong bridge!
- What?

1139
01:10:14,434 --> 01:10:15,867
The perpendicular one!

1140
01:10:23,134 --> 01:10:24,301
Martha!

1141
01:10:30,668 --> 01:10:31,634
Martha!

1142
01:10:34,833 --> 01:10:36,568
No!

1143
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:39,668
No!

1144
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,167
Spencer, behind you!

1145
01:10:44,501 --> 01:10:46,167
Jump!

1146
01:10:46,301 --> 01:10:48,601
Come on, I got you!

1147
01:10:50,067 --> 01:10:52,234
Spencer!

1148
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:01,234
Oh, no! Ow! Ow!

1149
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:13,767
Oh, no! No! Ow! Ow!

1150
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:14,934
Get off!

1151
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:23,467
Come on.

1152
01:11:28,467 --> 01:11:30,201
All right, bring it on.

1153
01:11:32,367 --> 01:11:35,301
Come on, come here. Ha, ha!

1154
01:11:37,334 --> 01:11:38,800
- Grandpa!
- Ow!

1155
01:11:38,934 --> 01:11:40,967
Grandpa! Enough!

1156
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:42,501
- Grandpa, stop!
- Yeah!

1157
01:11:42,634 --> 01:11:43,501
They're gone!

1158
01:11:45,934 --> 01:11:47,501
- Whoa!
- Yeah!

1159
01:11:55,067 --> 01:11:56,434
Come on!

1160
01:12:02,334 --> 01:12:03,501
Give me your hand!

1161
01:12:03,634 --> 01:12:05,034
- What?
- Trust me!

1162
01:12:26,167 --> 01:12:27,568
Oh! Go.

1163
01:12:29,201 --> 01:12:32,034
Last one. Aim for
the center of the parabola!

1164
01:12:35,134 --> 01:12:38,301
Oh, damn. Ugh! Son of a...

1165
01:12:40,034 --> 01:12:41,668
Ow!

1166
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,634
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1167
01:12:46,767 --> 01:12:48,900
- Eddie?
- Milo!

1168
01:12:49,034 --> 01:12:51,601
Eddie!
Hey, Eddie, where you going?

1169
01:12:52,733 --> 01:12:54,234
I need your help, Eddie.

1170
01:12:56,668 --> 01:12:57,833
Eddie!

1171
01:13:00,034 --> 01:13:01,000
Oh!

1172
01:13:03,634 --> 01:13:08,034
- Oh!
- Ugh.

1173
01:13:10,568 --> 01:13:12,601
Eddie! Milo!

1174
01:13:19,967 --> 01:13:21,334
Oh!

1175
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,034
- Seriously?
- Later.

1176
01:13:37,434 --> 01:13:38,800
- Run!
- Run!

1177
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,034
Hyah!

1178
01:14:12,867 --> 01:14:14,534
Hey, guys.

1179
01:14:14,668 --> 01:14:15,900
Who the hell's this?

1180
01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:18,334
Alex, what are you doing here?

1181
01:14:18,467 --> 01:14:20,534
Bethany thought
you might need some help.

1182
01:14:20,668 --> 01:14:23,134
- Where is Bethany?
- She's right here.

1183
01:14:24,167 --> 01:14:25,301
You mean...?

1184
01:14:31,534 --> 01:14:33,733
"Oh, my God, right?

1185
01:14:33,867 --> 01:14:36,201
Like, I'm a total horse.

1186
01:14:36,334 --> 01:14:39,167
I can't believe
that we found you guys.

1187
01:14:39,301 --> 01:14:41,000
Hi."

1188
01:14:41,134 --> 01:14:43,967
Yep, that's Bethany.
Ha-ha-ha. What's up, girl?

1189
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:45,167
Hey.

1190
01:14:45,301 --> 01:14:47,134
Oh, we brought you
some clothes.

1191
01:14:47,267 --> 01:14:48,534
You must be freezing.

1192
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:57,401
So, uh, this horse
is a character in the game?

1193
01:14:57,534 --> 01:14:59,434
Yeah. Cyclone's his name.

1194
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,534
- How's that feel?
- I don't know.

1195
01:15:03,668 --> 01:15:05,534
I sprained it pretty good.

1196
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:07,067
Where'd you get these clothes?

1197
01:15:07,201 --> 01:15:09,267
When I realized how far
north we were going,

1198
01:15:09,401 --> 01:15:11,034
- we stopped to go shopping.
- Ah.

1199
01:15:11,167 --> 01:15:13,201
You can shop here?
How did you know that?

1200
01:15:13,334 --> 01:15:15,534
I was here for 20 years, kiddo.

1201
01:15:15,668 --> 01:15:17,601
At least I got rid
of that stupid hat.

1202
01:15:17,733 --> 01:15:19,501
Now I got this stupid hat.

1203
01:15:35,767 --> 01:15:37,367
It's something,
isn't it?

1204
01:15:38,833 --> 01:15:40,467
Yeah,
it's something.

1205
01:15:43,301 --> 01:15:45,534
You know, Eddie...

1206
01:15:45,668 --> 01:15:50,367
you didn't lose everything
when you lost the restaurant.

1207
01:15:50,501 --> 01:15:52,301
You still got a lot, man.

1208
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,267
I lost my friend.

1209
01:16:01,367 --> 01:16:02,601
So did I.

1210
01:16:16,668 --> 01:16:18,034
I'm sorry, Milo.

1211
01:16:25,234 --> 01:16:28,067
Hey, I'm sorry too, Eddie.

1212
01:16:28,201 --> 01:16:30,668
I should have tracked you down
a long time ago.

1213
01:16:32,934 --> 01:16:35,467
I'm glad you came over
for coffee.

1214
01:16:38,833 --> 01:16:40,700
What made you do it, huh?

1215
01:16:42,467 --> 01:16:44,034
I mean, why now?

1216
01:16:47,201 --> 01:16:48,501
Milo, what's going on?

1217
01:16:54,534 --> 01:16:55,668
You're sick.

1218
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
How bad?

1219
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:04,833
I don't have much time left.

1220
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,201
Son of a bitch.

1221
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:12,900
But I count myself lucky,
Eddie.

1222
01:17:13,034 --> 01:17:16,000
I was married
to a wonderful woman.

1223
01:17:16,134 --> 01:17:18,833
I got to live a wonderful life.

1224
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:21,501
And not everybody
can say that.

1225
01:17:21,634 --> 01:17:24,867
That's why I wanted
to make things better with you.

1226
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,334
And now that they are...

1227
01:17:27,467 --> 01:17:29,501
well, I'm...

1228
01:17:29,634 --> 01:17:31,301
I'm happy about that too.

1229
01:17:45,301 --> 01:17:48,833
Grandpa, Milo.
Come on, we gotta go.

1230
01:17:55,934 --> 01:17:57,301
"The Fortress."

1231
01:17:57,434 --> 01:17:59,534
Looks like
the last level.

1232
01:17:59,668 --> 01:18:02,000
Okay, so we, uh,
climb that mountain

1233
01:18:02,134 --> 01:18:03,434
and then we sneak in somehow.

1234
01:18:03,568 --> 01:18:05,067
Yeah,
and then we steal the jewel

1235
01:18:05,201 --> 01:18:06,934
before the Brothers Kababik
get there.

1236
01:18:07,067 --> 01:18:09,767
- And then show it to the sun?
- Sounds like a plan.

1237
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:11,501
What?

1238
01:18:11,634 --> 01:18:14,934
I'm sorry, I think I missed
the "plan" part of the plan.

1239
01:18:15,067 --> 01:18:18,267
That last level almost killed
us all. I can barely walk.

1240
01:18:18,401 --> 01:18:20,668
Your grandpa beats the hell
out of the wrong guy

1241
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,668
or we get attacked by a bear,
what am I supposed to do?

1242
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,267
I'm not gonna beat up
the wrong guy.

1243
01:18:25,401 --> 01:18:27,067
You are gonna beat up
the wrong guy!

1244
01:18:27,201 --> 01:18:28,867
You're not a good Bravestone!

1245
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,568
You're too stubborn
and pissed off.

1246
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:32,067
You keep getting us killed.

1247
01:18:32,201 --> 01:18:33,767
What the hell
you talking about?

1248
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:35,401
And Milo...

1249
01:18:35,534 --> 01:18:37,501
And I say this
with all due respect, sir.

1250
01:18:37,634 --> 01:18:39,900
...is not a good person
to be the zoologist.

1251
01:18:40,034 --> 01:18:42,100
He talks too slow,
and by the time

1252
01:18:42,234 --> 01:18:43,867
he gets to the point,
you're dead!

1253
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,334
Once again, no offense.

1254
01:18:45,467 --> 01:18:46,334
None taken.

1255
01:18:46,467 --> 01:18:48,034
And let me tell you why.

1256
01:18:48,167 --> 01:18:50,900
- Because my friend Bernard...
- You see?

1257
01:18:51,034 --> 01:18:53,100
You're a thief who's
too neurotic to steal,

1258
01:18:53,234 --> 01:18:54,900
Bethany's a horse...

1259
01:18:56,634 --> 01:18:58,900
All I know is,
we are stuck here again,

1260
01:18:59,034 --> 01:19:03,134
we are running out of lives,
and my ankle is killing me! Ahh!

1261
01:19:03,267 --> 01:19:05,134
- Oh, my God!
- Fridge!

1262
01:19:05,267 --> 01:19:07,501
Fridge! Are you okay?

1263
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:11,167
Yo, you guys gotta see this!

1264
01:19:24,367 --> 01:19:27,301
That's what the water
looked like at the tree.

1265
01:19:27,434 --> 01:19:28,700
When we...

1266
01:19:28,833 --> 01:19:30,800
Switched bodies.

1267
01:20:12,401 --> 01:20:14,601
- Goddamn, that is cold!
- Oh!

1268
01:20:14,733 --> 01:20:18,668
Oh! Oh, man! It's freezing!

1269
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:19,934
What the hell, man?

1270
01:20:21,867 --> 01:20:23,234
Yes!

1271
01:20:23,367 --> 01:20:24,601
I missed you so much.

1272
01:20:24,733 --> 01:20:26,601
Oh, my God, you guys, hi.

1273
01:20:26,733 --> 01:20:29,434
Ahem, Spencer?

1274
01:20:30,733 --> 01:20:32,867
- Hey.
- Hey.

1275
01:20:36,733 --> 01:20:39,034
- Grandpa?
- Yeah, what?

1276
01:20:41,467 --> 01:20:42,334
Milo?

1277
01:20:45,301 --> 01:20:46,767
You should see
the size of your...

1278
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:50,034
Phew. Damn.

1279
01:20:50,167 --> 01:20:52,201
I never thought I'd be
this happy to shrink.

1280
01:20:53,367 --> 01:20:54,568
I have never seen anything

1281
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:55,767
quite like that before.

1282
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:57,234
Oh, my God, it's so good

1283
01:20:57,367 --> 01:20:59,568
to be able to talk again
with words.

1284
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:02,367
- Spencer, hi!
- Hey, Bethany.

1285
01:21:02,501 --> 01:21:04,034
We have so much
catching up to do.

1286
01:21:04,167 --> 01:21:05,534
I wanna hear about New York.

1287
01:21:05,668 --> 01:21:08,634
But it feels like this
isn't the perfect moment.

1288
01:21:08,767 --> 01:21:10,800
Right. Like, later.

1289
01:21:10,934 --> 01:21:12,067
Later.

1290
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:16,501
- Better?
- Yeah.

1291
01:21:16,634 --> 01:21:18,167
Much.

1292
01:21:22,301 --> 01:21:24,467
I got hair! Heh, heh!

1293
01:21:24,601 --> 01:21:27,367
For the first time in 40 years.
I gotta go tell Milo.

1294
01:21:27,501 --> 01:21:29,534
- Be careful out there, Grandpa.
- Yeah.

1295
01:21:29,668 --> 01:21:31,034
- How's your ankle?
- Hm?

1296
01:21:31,167 --> 01:21:33,067
- Your ankle.
- It's a little sore.

1297
01:21:33,201 --> 01:21:35,134
Not as bad
as you were making it seem.

1298
01:21:35,267 --> 01:21:37,000
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

1299
01:21:37,134 --> 01:21:39,867
You were making a big deal
of it. It's not that bad.

1300
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,700
Hey! Get the hell away
from that horse!

1301
01:21:47,833 --> 01:21:49,334
Freeze!

1302
01:21:49,467 --> 01:21:51,000
Milo! Hey!

1303
01:21:51,134 --> 01:21:52,634
Wait, which ankle was it?

1304
01:21:52,767 --> 01:21:53,934
- Hold it.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1305
01:21:54,067 --> 01:21:55,534
Get your hands off of me!

1306
01:21:55,668 --> 01:21:57,833
Hey! I'm with you, Milo.

1307
01:21:57,967 --> 01:21:59,167
I'm right here.

1308
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:04,568
Guys, guys.

1309
01:22:05,634 --> 01:22:07,134
Eddie and Milo.

1310
01:22:07,267 --> 01:22:08,201
They got them.

1311
01:22:15,634 --> 01:22:17,201
There's ice everywhere,

1312
01:22:17,334 --> 01:22:19,568
and there's only one road in.

1313
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:23,167
It's covered with guards.
I don't know how we'll get in.

1314
01:22:23,301 --> 01:22:25,167
Hm. Whoa!

1315
01:22:25,301 --> 01:22:27,934
Oh, okay. I see a dungeon

1316
01:22:28,067 --> 01:22:29,401
at the top of this ice wall.

1317
01:22:29,534 --> 01:22:31,767
That must be where
they're keeping your grandpa.

1318
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:34,367
And Milo is probably
in this, like, barn thing

1319
01:22:34,501 --> 01:22:36,501
all the way
on the other side of the place.

1320
01:22:36,634 --> 01:22:38,733
Okay. We gotta split up.

1321
01:22:38,867 --> 01:22:41,434
One team goes to get Milo,
the other busts out Grandpa.

1322
01:22:41,568 --> 01:22:43,501
But how do we get in?

1323
01:22:43,634 --> 01:22:45,000
Fridge, do you have

1324
01:22:45,134 --> 01:22:47,668
any ice-climbing equipment
in your backpack?

1325
01:22:49,733 --> 01:22:51,700
You mean something like this?

1326
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:54,367
- Just like that.
- See?

1327
01:22:54,501 --> 01:22:56,568
That's why
I'm the backpack guy.

1328
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:58,534
- That's why.
- Yeah. You're great at that.

1329
01:22:58,668 --> 01:23:00,201
Yeah, I know.

1330
01:23:00,334 --> 01:23:03,034
Martha,
will you come with me?

1331
01:23:03,167 --> 01:23:04,867
Of course.

1332
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,900
I forgot
what this part feels like.

1333
01:23:18,034 --> 01:23:19,733
It's scary.

1334
01:23:20,934 --> 01:23:23,167
- Yeah.
- Hey.

1335
01:23:23,301 --> 01:23:26,134
We can do it.
This team can do anything.

1336
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:29,201
Nobody knows that
better than me.

1337
01:23:29,334 --> 01:23:32,967
- Yeah.
- Come on, you guys.

1338
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:34,301
Bring it in.

1339
01:23:38,167 --> 01:23:39,700
<i>Be aggressive.</i>

1340
01:23:39,833 --> 01:23:41,234
<i>Be, be aggressive.</i>

1341
01:23:41,367 --> 01:23:42,668
<i>Be aggressive.</i>

1342
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:45,167
<i>Be, be aggressive.</i>
Come on, guys.

1343
01:23:45,301 --> 01:23:47,134
That's not what
I thought this was. No.

1344
01:23:47,267 --> 01:23:48,201
We should just go.

1345
01:23:48,334 --> 01:23:50,733
Okay, just... Go, team.

1346
01:24:06,501 --> 01:24:07,534
Okay.

1347
01:24:07,668 --> 01:24:09,401
I'm gonna try
to sneak in with them.

1348
01:24:09,534 --> 01:24:12,467
In this outfit, I might be able
to pass. You guys stay here...

1349
01:24:12,601 --> 01:24:14,267
What? No way.

1350
01:24:14,401 --> 01:24:15,767
Now's the moment. Stay here.

1351
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:18,234
- Alex, no!
- Go. Good luck, Alex.

1352
01:24:21,401 --> 01:24:22,700
Come on.

1353
01:24:22,833 --> 01:24:25,034
What are you talking about,
"Come on"? Bethany.

1354
01:24:25,167 --> 01:24:26,334
Bethany!

1355
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:31,668
Turn right.

1356
01:24:48,201 --> 01:24:50,700
You there. Stay where you are.

1357
01:24:50,833 --> 01:24:52,167
Who, us?

1358
01:24:52,301 --> 01:24:55,201
Are you the Brothers Kababik?

1359
01:24:55,334 --> 01:24:59,000
- Are we the who?
- Are you the Brothers Kababik?

1360
01:24:59,134 --> 01:25:00,733
Yes.

1361
01:25:00,867 --> 01:25:03,067
We are them. It is we. Us.

1362
01:25:03,201 --> 01:25:07,100
We are the Brothers Cadabra...
Kadabrik.

1363
01:25:07,234 --> 01:25:09,067
He is one brother,

1364
01:25:09,201 --> 01:25:12,867
and I am the other brother.

1365
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,934
We... We got different mothers.

1366
01:25:16,067 --> 01:25:20,367
But we, uh... We came to get
the thing that we came to get.

1367
01:25:22,833 --> 01:25:24,134
Brothers Kababik,

1368
01:25:24,267 --> 01:25:26,034
on behalf of Jurgen the Brutal,

1369
01:25:26,167 --> 01:25:28,467
welcome to Zhatmire Stronghold.

1370
01:25:28,601 --> 01:25:30,501
Ah, thank you.

1371
01:25:49,334 --> 01:25:52,334
There's something
I have to ask you.

1372
01:25:52,467 --> 01:25:53,833
Okay.

1373
01:25:53,967 --> 01:25:56,800
Why didn't you come visit
when you were supposed to?

1374
01:25:56,934 --> 01:25:58,634
You canceled the first time,

1375
01:25:58,767 --> 01:26:01,467
then you were gonna come
for Halloween. You cancel again.

1376
01:26:01,601 --> 01:26:03,167
Then the next time
I hear from you,

1377
01:26:03,301 --> 01:26:05,167
you tell me
we should take a break?

1378
01:26:08,501 --> 01:26:11,668
It's just... I saw all
your pictures on Instagram,

1379
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,700
and you looked like you
were having so much fun, and...

1380
01:26:14,833 --> 01:26:18,267
I just got really insecure
or something.

1381
01:26:18,401 --> 01:26:21,634
Like I wasn't the guy
I thought I was.

1382
01:26:21,767 --> 01:26:24,401
Or I wasn't the guy
you thought I was.

1383
01:26:24,534 --> 01:26:26,833
Which would be even worse.

1384
01:26:26,967 --> 01:26:30,167
Spencer,
do you think I'm not...

1385
01:26:30,301 --> 01:26:33,201
totally terrified
all the time?

1386
01:26:33,334 --> 01:26:35,201
I got to school,
and suddenly,

1387
01:26:35,334 --> 01:26:39,267
for the first time ever,
people really liked me.

1388
01:26:39,401 --> 01:26:41,367
But I'm always thinking that...

1389
01:26:41,501 --> 01:26:43,700
I don't know, like it's...

1390
01:26:43,833 --> 01:26:45,334
Like it's just a matter of time

1391
01:26:45,467 --> 01:26:48,534
before somebody figures out
who I really am.

1392
01:26:48,668 --> 01:26:49,900
But then I see you.

1393
01:26:51,967 --> 01:26:54,767
And you're the person
who makes me feel good...

1394
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:56,367
about who I really am.

1395
01:26:57,733 --> 01:27:00,934
When you're, like,
scared and insecure,

1396
01:27:01,067 --> 01:27:03,900
that's when you need
your people the most.

1397
01:27:14,967 --> 01:27:15,867
Hey, Mr. Walker.

1398
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:19,234
Why the long face?

1399
01:27:21,367 --> 01:27:23,967
Dad joke. Sorry.
Can't help it.

1400
01:27:25,601 --> 01:27:28,401
Let's get you out of here.

1401
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:57,900
Okay.

1402
01:27:58,034 --> 01:28:00,367
It's just an obstacle course.

1403
01:28:00,501 --> 01:28:02,067
You were good at those.

1404
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:20,301
All right,
all right, get a room.

1405
01:28:24,134 --> 01:28:26,867
Grandpa...
let's get you out of there.

1406
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,034
Here.

1407
01:28:29,167 --> 01:28:32,000
- Unh!
- Whoa.

1408
01:28:32,134 --> 01:28:34,000
Let's blow this joint, huh?

1409
01:28:34,134 --> 01:28:35,900
We still have
to find the jewel.

1410
01:28:36,034 --> 01:28:38,501
It must be in a vault
or treasure room or something.

1411
01:28:38,634 --> 01:28:40,601
Yeah, that's how
it works in these games.

1412
01:28:40,733 --> 01:28:42,767
I passed a vault
on the way up to this dump.

1413
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:45,201
Single access,
3-foot-thick steel door.

1414
01:28:45,334 --> 01:28:47,867
Only way in is through
a grate in the ceiling.

1415
01:28:56,234 --> 01:28:59,700
Hoo... Oh. Huh.

1416
01:28:59,833 --> 01:29:01,534
I think I got it now.

1417
01:29:03,867 --> 01:29:06,700
Just stay on...

1418
01:29:06,833 --> 01:29:08,034
the raised ones.

1419
01:29:31,134 --> 01:29:33,568
Jurgen the Brutal awaits.

1420
01:29:35,833 --> 01:29:39,867
So, tell me,
which brother is which?

1421
01:29:42,367 --> 01:29:44,334
Um, how do you mean?

1422
01:29:44,467 --> 01:29:47,334
Which brother is which?

1423
01:29:47,467 --> 01:29:50,700
Which of you is Augustus
and which is Tomatoli?

1424
01:29:52,201 --> 01:29:55,967
Um... I am Augustus.

1425
01:29:57,267 --> 01:29:59,234
And I'm Tomatolik.

1426
01:30:00,601 --> 01:30:03,367
Augustus Kababik.

1427
01:30:03,501 --> 01:30:05,700
The cleverest man
in all of Jumanji.

1428
01:30:07,267 --> 01:30:09,167
Yes, I'm totally that man.

1429
01:30:09,301 --> 01:30:12,034
- And Tomatoli Kababik.
- That's me.

1430
01:30:12,167 --> 01:30:14,634
The bravest eunuch.

1431
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,867
- Wait a minute, what?
- Did you say, "Eunuch"?

1432
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,668
Tomatoli Kababik,
everyone knows the tale

1433
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,301
of your great
and generous sacrifice.

1434
01:30:23,434 --> 01:30:25,534
How you gave your testicles

1435
01:30:25,668 --> 01:30:28,501
in order to save the region
from the floods.

1436
01:30:28,634 --> 01:30:30,034
There might be
a little confusion.

1437
01:30:30,167 --> 01:30:31,767
Of course.
Everybody knows the story

1438
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:35,334
about my little brother
and his famous testicles.

1439
01:30:35,467 --> 01:30:38,733
- Wherever they may be.
- Wherever they may be.

1440
01:30:38,867 --> 01:30:41,434
All right, let's back up.
Let's go back a little bit.

1441
01:30:41,568 --> 01:30:43,700
- Let's clear some stuff up.
- He's super brave.

1442
01:30:43,833 --> 01:30:45,867
I've always been
the super clever one,

1443
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,100
and he's always been
super brave.

1444
01:30:48,234 --> 01:30:50,367
- And super ball-less.
- Stop saying that!

1445
01:30:50,501 --> 01:30:52,867
- Both of my balls are right here!
- In spirit.

1446
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,867
- Hey...
- They're here in spirit.

1447
01:30:57,067 --> 01:30:58,234
Always.

1448
01:30:59,301 --> 01:31:00,234
Of course.

1449
01:31:01,301 --> 01:31:02,267
Right, bro?

1450
01:31:07,534 --> 01:31:09,534
Right.

1451
01:31:09,668 --> 01:31:12,434
I got no balls.

1452
01:31:18,134 --> 01:31:20,234
There's the chest.

1453
01:31:20,367 --> 01:31:22,301
Okay. You're up, Grandpa.

1454
01:31:22,434 --> 01:31:25,067
- Who, me?
- Yes. You're the cat burglar.

1455
01:31:25,201 --> 01:31:27,434
- Huh?
- Your character, Ming.

1456
01:31:27,568 --> 01:31:29,267
- Ming?
- Yes, Ming.

1457
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:30,800
Your avatar.
That's her name.

1458
01:31:30,934 --> 01:31:32,568
In your satchel,
you have lockpicks.

1459
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:35,334
Lockpicks?
Why would I have lockpicks?

1460
01:31:35,467 --> 01:31:37,733
Because Ming's the cat burglar.

1461
01:31:37,867 --> 01:31:39,833
Don't you think one
of you should do this?

1462
01:31:39,967 --> 01:31:42,201
- You have the skills.
- I have the skills?

1463
01:31:42,334 --> 01:31:44,900
Not you. Ming.

1464
01:31:45,034 --> 01:31:46,967
Right. Ming.

1465
01:31:48,634 --> 01:31:50,700
Please don't ask who Ming is.

1466
01:32:01,034 --> 01:32:02,534
Not bad, huh?

1467
01:32:04,367 --> 01:32:07,367
Now we just gotta figure out
how to get you out of here.

1468
01:32:18,167 --> 01:32:19,401
Shall we?

1469
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,534
Huh.

1470
01:32:23,668 --> 01:32:25,034
Now, that's cool.

1471
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:32,668
Welcome. May I offer you
a piece of cake?

1472
01:32:33,733 --> 01:32:35,034
No! No!

1473
01:32:35,167 --> 01:32:36,668
No!

1474
01:32:40,467 --> 01:32:41,833
No, thank you.

1475
01:32:52,467 --> 01:32:53,767
Steady.

1476
01:33:07,134 --> 01:33:10,934
Ha! I'd like to see
your friend Ming do that!

1477
01:33:16,234 --> 01:33:18,034
We got an issue here.

1478
01:33:20,467 --> 01:33:22,234
Oh, thank you.

1479
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,601
Thank you.

1480
01:33:34,733 --> 01:33:38,301
Brothers Kababik,
I present Jurgen the Brutal.

1481
01:33:48,201 --> 01:33:49,568
At last,

1482
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:53,167
we meet on this historic day.

1483
01:33:53,301 --> 01:33:57,467
Yes, it is so great
to meet you.

1484
01:33:57,601 --> 01:34:01,000
Your Honor, if that be
the Falcon Jewel

1485
01:34:01,134 --> 01:34:05,167
upon your thick and meaty neck,

1486
01:34:05,301 --> 01:34:07,467
perhaps we should...

1487
01:34:07,601 --> 01:34:09,134
take it.

1488
01:34:09,267 --> 01:34:13,534
Today we forge
an unbreakable alliance.

1489
01:34:13,668 --> 01:34:16,134
Your family will join me,

1490
01:34:16,267 --> 01:34:20,900
and land by land,
we'll take the world.

1491
01:34:21,034 --> 01:34:24,401
So I ask, on this historic day,

1492
01:34:24,534 --> 01:34:26,067
where is she?

1493
01:34:27,634 --> 01:34:30,067
- Uh, where's who?
- Who you talking about?

1494
01:34:30,201 --> 01:34:32,000
Your sister.

1495
01:34:32,134 --> 01:34:33,800
Soon to be my bride.

1496
01:34:37,234 --> 01:34:42,100
You know what? I think that
there's been a misunderstanding.

1497
01:34:42,234 --> 01:34:44,034
Where is your sister?

1498
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,434
Which sister were
we talking about?

1499
01:34:49,568 --> 01:34:53,334
Debbie or... Brooke?

1500
01:34:53,467 --> 01:34:55,401
Or Sierra?

1501
01:34:55,534 --> 01:34:59,201
Where is your sister?

1502
01:35:01,301 --> 01:35:03,700
She's getting ready,
back at the hotel.

1503
01:35:03,833 --> 01:35:06,201
She's doing what brides do
on their wedding day.

1504
01:35:06,334 --> 01:35:10,234
Hanging with the girls, getting
her hair done, mani-pedi.

1505
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:15,601
If you come here
without your sister...

1506
01:35:18,367 --> 01:35:20,434
I just might have
to cut off your heads.

1507
01:35:20,568 --> 01:35:22,733
- Oh, no! No, no, no. Don't.
- Hey. Hey. Hey!

1508
01:35:22,867 --> 01:35:24,367
- God, no.
- Hey, get off!

1509
01:35:24,501 --> 01:35:28,034
- No. No.
- So I'll ask one last time:

1510
01:35:28,167 --> 01:35:31,367
- Getting a mani-pedi!
- Where is your sister?

1511
01:35:31,501 --> 01:35:33,267
I'm right here.

1512
01:35:41,334 --> 01:35:44,501
Gwendolyn Hortencia
Lewelda Kababik?

1513
01:35:44,634 --> 01:35:45,634
Is that you?

1514
01:35:45,767 --> 01:35:48,234
Um, yes.

1515
01:35:48,367 --> 01:35:49,501
That is me.

1516
01:35:50,767 --> 01:35:52,134
Now, please,

1517
01:35:52,267 --> 01:35:55,900
O Brutal One,
release my brothers.

1518
01:35:59,134 --> 01:36:01,401
And is it your
intention, on this day,

1519
01:36:01,534 --> 01:36:05,467
at this hour, to wed
Jurgen the Brutal of Zhatmire?

1520
01:36:07,134 --> 01:36:09,301
Yep. That's my plan.

1521
01:36:09,434 --> 01:36:12,167
And is it your intention
to mother his children

1522
01:36:12,301 --> 01:36:15,301
and forge in blood
this union with your family?

1523
01:36:17,367 --> 01:36:18,401
Yes.

1524
01:36:18,534 --> 01:36:20,534
Gwendolyn Kababik...

1525
01:36:20,668 --> 01:36:22,534
known throughout the world

1526
01:36:22,668 --> 01:36:25,367
for your beauty and cunning.

1527
01:36:25,501 --> 01:36:29,000
And now you're mine.

1528
01:36:32,167 --> 01:36:36,568
Um... May I hold
the Falcon Jewel?

1529
01:36:38,034 --> 01:36:40,733
Of course, my bride.

1530
01:36:40,867 --> 01:36:42,534
Thank you.

1531
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:44,934
Get it.

1532
01:36:48,067 --> 01:36:49,833
Jurgen the Brutal!

1533
01:36:49,967 --> 01:36:54,501
The Brothers Kababik
have been delayed in Gorek.

1534
01:36:54,634 --> 01:36:56,833
These are impostors!

1535
01:36:56,967 --> 01:36:58,668
- Impostors?
- Seize them!

1536
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,601
No, no, no.
Oh, no. We can explain.

1537
01:37:00,733 --> 01:37:01,767
Oh, no, no, no.

1538
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:03,867
I forgot to tell you one thing.

1539
01:37:06,034 --> 01:37:07,434
I have a boyfriend.

1540
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:21,167
Get back.
Stay back.

1541
01:37:21,301 --> 01:37:23,100
- Stay away.
- Get back!

1542
01:37:23,234 --> 01:37:25,201
Get back!

1543
01:37:43,867 --> 01:37:47,700
- Get out of here!
- I will torch you, bitches.

1544
01:37:47,833 --> 01:37:49,900
I will literally
burn your face.

1545
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,201
I'll meet the brothers
in Gorek.

1546
01:38:14,334 --> 01:38:15,367
Kill them all!

1547
01:38:17,867 --> 01:38:19,301
Go get him!

1548
01:38:19,434 --> 01:38:20,467
Go get the jewel!

1549
01:38:20,601 --> 01:38:22,668
Don't worry about us. Just go!

1550
01:38:24,833 --> 01:38:26,000
Backpack.

1551
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:31,668
Get away! I know geometry.

1552
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:34,900
I'm not messing around,
you guys. Get away!

1553
01:38:35,034 --> 01:38:37,067
Fridge, we're gonna die!

1554
01:38:48,201 --> 01:38:50,167
Anybody wanna dance
with the bride?

1555
01:39:56,434 --> 01:39:59,501
You want a piece?
Come on!

1556
01:40:05,467 --> 01:40:06,800
Nunchucks.

1557
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:20,800
Awesome

1558
01:40:26,367 --> 01:40:27,733
We did it.

1559
01:40:27,867 --> 01:40:29,301
Let's go!

1560
01:40:38,634 --> 01:40:40,367
- Come on, come on!
- Hurry!

1561
01:40:53,534 --> 01:40:56,067
Whoa! Unh! Whoa!

1562
01:41:02,034 --> 01:41:03,568
Look!

1563
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:06,568
- Is that Spencer?
- Oh, my God.

1564
01:41:57,201 --> 01:41:58,700
No!

1565
01:42:04,434 --> 01:42:05,334
Spencer!

1566
01:42:05,467 --> 01:42:06,800
- Oh!
- Oh!

1567
01:42:14,201 --> 01:42:16,501
Who are you?

1568
01:42:22,201 --> 01:42:24,301
I'm Dr. Smolder Bravestone.

1569
01:42:49,634 --> 01:42:51,967
Spencer!

1570
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,367
- He says to get on his back.
- Who, me?

1571
01:43:29,067 --> 01:43:31,034
Oh, no. Milo!

1572
01:43:31,167 --> 01:43:32,434
- Oh, my God.
- What's he doing?

1573
01:43:32,568 --> 01:43:33,601
Wait.

1574
01:43:34,867 --> 01:43:36,401
Milo!

1575
01:43:45,234 --> 01:43:46,668
Yeah, Milo!

1576
01:43:48,301 --> 01:43:49,534
Go!

1577
01:43:52,201 --> 01:43:53,934
We're coming, Spencer!

1578
01:43:57,867 --> 01:43:59,700
"Show it to the sun."

1579
01:43:59,833 --> 01:44:01,134
Grandpa, the jewel!

1580
01:44:01,267 --> 01:44:04,301
You gotta show it
to the sun! Get ready!

1581
01:44:10,833 --> 01:44:13,067
Come on, Milo!

1582
01:44:13,201 --> 01:44:15,334
- Go!
- Come on, come on!

1583
01:44:29,634 --> 01:44:31,234
Yeah!

1584
01:44:41,634 --> 01:44:43,634
- Call out its name.
- Call out its name.

1585
01:44:43,767 --> 01:44:45,301
Call out its name!

1586
01:44:45,434 --> 01:44:48,134
Jumanji!

1587
01:44:48,267 --> 01:44:51,367
Jumanji!

1588
01:44:51,501 --> 01:44:52,467
What'd they say?

1589
01:44:54,767 --> 01:44:55,900
Jumanji?

1590
01:45:01,034 --> 01:45:02,234
Oh!

1591
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:27,833
- Oh!
- Yes!

1592
01:45:27,967 --> 01:45:29,767
Ha, ha, we won!

1593
01:45:29,900 --> 01:45:31,568
- We did it!
- Hey.

1594
01:45:32,867 --> 01:45:34,934
Put me down.

1595
01:45:35,067 --> 01:45:36,733
- Put me down, goddamn it. Stop!
- Okay.

1596
01:45:36,867 --> 01:45:39,534
Is this what you were
looking for? This little thing?

1597
01:45:39,668 --> 01:45:41,267
Grandpa, you guys
were incredible.

1598
01:45:41,401 --> 01:45:45,000
Yeah, that's the thing about
Milo. He's got a lot of skills.

1599
01:45:45,134 --> 01:45:46,401
Milo and Eddie.

1600
01:45:48,034 --> 01:45:49,367
Milo and Eddie.

1601
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,434
Uh, what are we doing
here now?

1602
01:46:05,467 --> 01:46:06,967
Whoa!

1603
01:46:09,034 --> 01:46:10,900
Well done,
intrepid adventurers.

1604
01:46:11,034 --> 01:46:13,668
You have saved Jumanji.
Again.

1605
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,467
And now,
with your permission,

1606
01:46:16,601 --> 01:46:19,501
Dr. Bravestone,
I will take the jewel from here.

1607
01:46:19,634 --> 01:46:22,367
I will protect it with my life
and return it to the care

1608
01:46:22,501 --> 01:46:24,833
of the elder
at the Avian Province.

1609
01:46:24,967 --> 01:46:27,134
And so your work here is done.

1610
01:46:27,267 --> 01:46:31,067
All of Jumanji thanks you. And,
sadly, this is where we part.

1611
01:46:31,201 --> 01:46:32,700
I don't know
what's sad about it.

1612
01:46:32,833 --> 01:46:34,733
I'm ready to get
the hell out of here.

1613
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:40,134
What?

1614
01:46:41,967 --> 01:46:43,634
Really?

1615
01:46:45,833 --> 01:46:47,833
Hey, guys, you're not gonna
believe this.

1616
01:46:47,967 --> 01:46:50,467
What'd he say?

1617
01:46:50,601 --> 01:46:52,833
- He says that he...
- He wants to stay.

1618
01:46:54,767 --> 01:46:58,800
He says somebody's gotta stay
and look after this place.

1619
01:46:58,934 --> 01:47:01,900
And that he's 75 years old
and he just learned how to fly.

1620
01:47:05,201 --> 01:47:07,601
But he won't be able
to get out.

1621
01:47:08,967 --> 01:47:10,167
He knows.

1622
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,833
Oh, Milo.

1623
01:47:19,234 --> 01:47:22,201
I feel like I, uh,
just got you back.

1624
01:47:22,334 --> 01:47:24,034
Now I'm losing you for good.

1625
01:47:26,401 --> 01:47:29,900
"You're not losing me, buddy.
I'll always be with you."

1626
01:47:36,401 --> 01:47:38,534
Being your partner...

1627
01:47:38,668 --> 01:47:42,267
is one of the best things
I ever got to be.

1628
01:47:44,833 --> 01:47:46,401
He says, "Thank you."

1629
01:47:46,534 --> 01:47:48,334
No, no.

1630
01:47:48,467 --> 01:47:50,367
Thank you, Milo.

1631
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:20,401
Yes!

1632
01:48:20,534 --> 01:48:22,334
- Take care, Milo!
- Bye!

1633
01:48:22,467 --> 01:48:23,700
- Go, Milo!
- So long, Milo!

1634
01:48:23,833 --> 01:48:25,501
Bye-bye, Mr. Walker!

1635
01:48:28,833 --> 01:48:30,967
That's my partner right there.

1636
01:48:36,867 --> 01:48:40,167
Everybody should be so lucky
to have a friend like Milo.

1637
01:48:56,034 --> 01:48:58,833
Come on, Grandpa. Let's go home.

1638
01:49:03,367 --> 01:49:04,634
Hey, guys.

1639
01:49:07,100 --> 01:49:09,167
Thanks for coming to get me.

1640
01:49:14,134 --> 01:49:16,900
You do it again, your ass
is gonna be stuck here, Spencer!

1641
01:49:17,034 --> 01:49:18,367
'Cause I'm not coming back!

1642
01:49:41,401 --> 01:49:42,767
Everybody okay?

1643
01:49:44,367 --> 01:49:45,934
Yeah.

1644
01:49:46,067 --> 01:49:47,568
Grandpa,
you okay?

1645
01:49:49,201 --> 01:49:50,934
Yeah, I'm good.

1646
01:49:52,867 --> 01:49:54,934
Holy shit.

1647
01:50:08,668 --> 01:50:10,634
Strike. Square one.
Counterstrike.

1648
01:50:10,767 --> 01:50:12,234
The fat one on the bottom?

1649
01:50:12,367 --> 01:50:14,634
The fat...
No, the fat one above the R.

1650
01:50:14,767 --> 01:50:15,934
- Okay.
- Atop number two.

1651
01:50:16,067 --> 01:50:18,501
- Yeah. Yeah.
- So strike, strike.

1652
01:50:18,634 --> 01:50:20,700
- Yeah.
- Counterstrike.

1653
01:50:20,833 --> 01:50:23,501
Then kick me. O.

1654
01:50:27,700 --> 01:50:29,034
Let me tell you something.

1655
01:50:29,167 --> 01:50:32,367
- Getting old...
- I know. Getting old sucks.

1656
01:50:34,301 --> 01:50:35,700
Getting old...

1657
01:50:38,833 --> 01:50:40,234
...is a gift.

1658
01:50:42,668 --> 01:50:45,000
I forget that
sometimes.

1659
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:47,534
But it is.

1660
01:50:51,833 --> 01:50:54,234
What more
could a guy possibly want?

1661
01:51:00,334 --> 01:51:02,234
Hey, guys.

1662
01:51:02,367 --> 01:51:04,234
How was your day?

1663
01:51:04,367 --> 01:51:06,733
It was really great.

1664
01:51:06,867 --> 01:51:08,534
Yeah.

1665
01:51:08,668 --> 01:51:11,634
Spencer taught me
how to play a video game.

1666
01:51:26,134 --> 01:51:27,501
Oh, hell, no.

1667
01:51:39,201 --> 01:51:40,767
You okay, Grandpa?

1668
01:51:43,568 --> 01:51:44,833
Yeah.

1669
01:51:44,967 --> 01:51:47,067
A lot of good memories here.

1670
01:51:58,668 --> 01:51:59,733
Eddie.

1671
01:51:59,867 --> 01:52:01,568
Eddie, is that you?

1672
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:03,100
Nora.

1673
01:52:03,234 --> 01:52:05,000
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

1674
01:52:05,134 --> 01:52:06,000
Hey, guys.

1675
01:52:06,134 --> 01:52:07,334
- Hi.
- Hi.

1676
01:52:08,833 --> 01:52:10,234
What's up, bro?

1677
01:52:10,367 --> 01:52:12,934
So how's business?

1678
01:52:13,067 --> 01:52:14,534
Oh, you know how it is.

1679
01:52:14,668 --> 01:52:17,800
My manager quit six months
ago, moved to Philly.

1680
01:52:17,934 --> 01:52:20,501
Place has been kind of
a mess ever since.

1681
01:52:20,634 --> 01:52:24,167
It's hard to find people
who really know how to do this.

1682
01:52:24,301 --> 01:52:26,467
Oh, well...

1683
01:52:26,601 --> 01:52:28,534
I don't have to tell you this.

1684
01:52:28,668 --> 01:52:30,534
Mm.

1685
01:52:32,034 --> 01:52:33,800
So you need some help
around here?

1686
01:52:35,367 --> 01:52:36,733
You mean it?

1687
01:52:36,867 --> 01:52:38,900
I mean, I...

1688
01:52:39,034 --> 01:52:40,467
I'd be honored.

1689
01:52:40,601 --> 01:52:42,000
Well...

1690
01:52:44,167 --> 01:52:46,000
It's really good
to see you, Eddie.

1691
01:52:47,267 --> 01:52:48,534
Likewise.

1692
01:52:53,201 --> 01:52:54,568
Um...

1693
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:01,900
Um, I'm... I'm gonna take this

1694
01:53:02,034 --> 01:53:04,900
where I was going and...

1695
01:53:05,034 --> 01:53:07,167
I'll be right back.

1696
01:53:07,301 --> 01:53:09,733
You guys gotta come
to New York too.

1697
01:53:09,867 --> 01:53:12,301
Yeah, I can't wait.

1698
01:53:12,434 --> 01:53:14,967
This team, forever.

1699
01:53:15,100 --> 01:53:16,367
Forever.

1700
01:53:16,501 --> 01:53:18,267
Always.

1701
01:53:18,401 --> 01:53:20,900
Uh, always and forever?

1702
01:53:22,534 --> 01:53:25,401
- Yeah, let's keep close though.
- Of course, yeah.

1703
01:53:25,534 --> 01:53:27,034
One thing.

1704
01:53:27,167 --> 01:53:28,700
Can we all agree?

1705
01:53:28,833 --> 01:53:30,601
Let's never go back there.

1706
01:53:30,733 --> 01:53:32,700
- We already agreed on that.
- That's fine.

1707
01:54:14,092 --> 01:54:15,492
Sorry it's so late.

1708
01:54:15,625 --> 01:54:17,059
Yeah, it's that time of year.

1709
01:54:17,192 --> 01:54:19,558
- Everyone's heaters are broken.
- Oh, it's no problem.

1710
01:54:19,692 --> 01:54:21,226
I'm just glad you made it.

1711
01:54:21,359 --> 01:54:23,126
The furnace
is right over here.

1712
01:54:28,226 --> 01:54:30,625
Is that
an old video game console?

1713
01:54:30,759 --> 01:54:32,525
Hm?

1714
01:54:32,659 --> 01:54:34,592
Oh, yeah, probably.

1715
01:54:34,725 --> 01:54:36,926
It belongs to my son.

1716
01:54:37,059 --> 01:54:38,525
Hm.

1717
01:54:38,659 --> 01:54:41,126
Yeah, I'm a big gamer.

1718
01:54:41,259 --> 01:54:43,092
I've never seen
anything like it.

1719
01:54:48,259 --> 01:54:50,092
Well, it looks like
it's broken.

1720
01:54:51,492 --> 01:54:54,192
Maybe you shouldn't
touch it.

1721
01:55:15,026 --> 01:55:17,960
