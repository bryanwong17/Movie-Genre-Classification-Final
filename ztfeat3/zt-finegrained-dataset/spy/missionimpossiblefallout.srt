1
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:44,162
Do you, Ethan, take Julia
to be your lawful wedded wife?

2
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:45,253
I do.

3
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:50,206
To have, to hold,
to love, Cherish, honor, and protect?

4
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,756
I do.

5
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:55,961
To shield from terrors known
and unknown?

6
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,139
To lie, to deceive...
What?

7
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:03,219
To live a double life,
to fail to prevent her abduction,

8
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:06,931
erase her identity,
force her into hiding,

9
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,481
take away all she has known...

10
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,569
Stop.

11
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,214
In a selfish, futile,
fleeting attempt...

12
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,318
Stop.

13
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,943
To escape your own true self?

14
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,068
Please, stop.

15
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,491
And, Julia, do you choose to accept?

16
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,579
Don't.

17
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,120
I do.
No.

18
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,706
You should have killed me, Ethan.

19
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,780
Fate whispers to the warrior...

20
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,274
A storm is coming.

21
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,611
And the warrior whispers back...

22
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,621
I am the storm.

23
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,858
Good evening, Mr. hunt.

24
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,160
The anarchist Solomon Lane.

25
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,200
Since you captured him 2 years ago,

26
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:50,375
his absence from the world stage
has had unintended consequences.

27
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,123
His syndicate of rogue covert operatives

28
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,956
continues to wreak havoc
around the globe.

29
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,915
The CIA's special activities division

30
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,127
has relentlessly hunted Lane's
elite network of hosliles.

31
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,554
But many remain unknown and at large.

32
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,764
The remnants of this
extremist splinter cell

33
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,263
refer to themselves as "the apostles.

34
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,430
they have since adopted
a policy of terror-for-hire,

35
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,766
making them an even greater threat.

36
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,192
They are responsible for
the recent smallpox outbreak

37
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,610
in Indian-controlled kashmir,

38
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,984
along the borders of China and Pakistan,

39
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,441
threatening one-third
of the world's population.

40
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,527
The epidemic is being contained,

41
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,077
but intelligence would indicate

42
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:30,533
that a new client has hired the apostles
for a more ambitious operation.

43
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,367
They have been contacted by this man,

44
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:36,171
an unidentified extremist
known only by the code name John lark,

45
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,340
author of this apocalyptic manifesto

46
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:41,840
calling for the destruction
of the current world order.

47
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,717
It is believed lark is responsible
for the disappearance

48
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,971
of Norwegian nuclear weapons
specialist nils delbruuk.

49
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,143
Dr. delbruuk's security
clearance was revoked

50
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,142
after he expressed
fiercely anti-religious views.

51
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,224
Meanwhile, the apostles
have been in contact

52
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,559
with elements of
the eastern European underworld,

53
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,020
who are in possession
of three plutonium cores

54
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:02,857
stolen from a missile base
in eastern Russia.

55
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,776
This would indicate that
John lark and the apostles

56
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:09,705
are working together
to acquire functioning nuclear weapons.

57
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,574
Nest estimates that a man
with delbruuk"s knowledge,

58
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,954
using the materials in play,

59
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:18,414
could complete three nuclear weapons
in as little as 72 hours.

60
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,214
These devices would be man-portable

61
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,793
and deployable anywhere
on earth overnight.

62
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,379
In the hands of John lark
and the apostles,

63
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,760
these weapons represent
an unprecedented threat

64
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,557
to countless millions.

65
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,347
Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

66
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,021
is to prevent the apostles
from acquiring plutonium

67
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,599
using any means at your disposal.

68
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:41,441
If you or any members of your imf team
are caught or killed,

69
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,568
the secretary will disavow
any knowledge of your actions.

70
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,739
Good luck, Ethan.

71
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,944
This message will
self-destruct in five seconds.

72
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,426
He's late.

73
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:08,547
He's never late.
He'll be here.

74
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,007
I don't like it.

75
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,677
Something about this guy
just really gives me the creeps.

76
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,763
Okay, just relax.

77
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,188
I'm relaxed.

78
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,355
You don't sound relaxed.

79
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,837
Luther, does he sound relaxed to you?

80
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,817
He sounds terrified.

81
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,442
Please, I'm not terrified.
I just have a bad feeling is all.

82
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,273
I thought you said
you were relaxed.

83
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,860
It's entirely possible to be relaxed
and extremely uneasy at the same time.

84
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,786
No, it's not.
You do it all the time.

85
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,454
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.

86
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,657
No, he doesn't.

87
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,687
I'm supposed to believe that
you are perfectly relaxed,

88
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,121
right here, now...
Beniji.

89
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,357
In a dark alleyway, waiting to buy

90
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,542
black-market plutonium
from a psychopath.

91
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,294
Benji, I won't let anything
happen to you.

92
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,795
Okay.
See, Benji,

93
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,217
you're perfectly safe.

94
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,169
That's easy for you to say,
you're in the Van.

95
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,076
Well, you wanted to be
in the field, tough guy.

96
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,136
And tonight, Luther,
I would like to be in the Van!

97
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,763
He's here.

98
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,390
Oh, god.

99
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,118
Have that money ready, Luther.

100
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,452
Copy.

101
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,542
Ethan, do you copy?

102
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,203
Do you copy?

103
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,142
Are we finally gonna
do this or not?

104
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:46,319
I have survived in this business
with the help of a voice in my head.

105
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,483
This voice is never wrong.
And whenever I meet you,

106
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,781
it tells me the same thing.

107
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,831
What's that?

108
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,081
Nothing.

109
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:06,627
I'm here to do business.
Tell the voice to flip a coin.

110
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,413
What's that?

111
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,784
This is a beryllium rod,
which is causing

112
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,790
a reaction with the plutonium
inside the core.

113
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,013
That's them.

114
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,016
The money?

115
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,686
The money.

116
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:05,857
Bring the money.

117
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,030
Luther, bring the money.

118
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,708
We're gonna need
that money, Luther.

119
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,629
Kill them.

120
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,223
I got it!

121
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,471
Luther, do you copy?

122
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,691
Luther!

123
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,190
Luther, come in.

124
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,100
Luther's not here right now.

125
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,528
What can the apostles
do for you, hunt?

126
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,901
What do you want?
You're boxed in, hunt.

127
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:58,489
Give us the plutonium
and walk away.

128
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,616
Benji, get the car.

129
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,288
I don't think I can do that.
Beniji.

130
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,081
Get the car.

131
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,308
We'll make you a deal, hunt.

132
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,233
Give us the plutonium
and we won't kill your friend.

133
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,734
Don't you do it, Ethan! Not for me!

134
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,457
I'm gonna count to three.

135
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,341
One.

136
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,755
Two.
Luther...

137
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,927
'M sorry.
Three.

138
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,403
I'm sorry.
I didn't know what else to do.

139
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,855
We're good.

140
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,573
You okay?
I should be dead.

141
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,575
We should all be dead.

142
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,907
Why aren't we?

143
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,951
Where's the plutonium?

144
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,598
It's gone.

145
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,432
If you're just joining us,

146
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:53,813
three massive explosions
have gone off simultaneously

147
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,777
this image is live in Rome,
looking toward the Vatican

148
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,200
and is as close as our cameras can get.

149
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:05,404
It is believed that
the pope was in residence

150
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,738
at the time of the blast.

151
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,917
Also live, we're looking at Jerusalem
from just outside the city.

152
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,290
Also live, the holy city of mecca

153
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,918
from the USS Ronald Reagan
in the red sea

154
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,125
off the coast of Saudi Arabia.

155
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,210
Radiation has been detected,

156
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:23,342
indicating that
nuclear weapons were used

157
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,219
in these unspeakable attacks.

158
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,471
Ethan, it's time.

159
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:28,998
No word on casualties yet,
but we can assume

160
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,683
the death toll is catastrophic.

161
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,098
Early reports suggest
the weapons used

162
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,684
would require
highly specialized knowledge

163
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,393
that very few people possess.

164
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:42,653
The question now is who would attack
all three of these holy sites? And why?

165
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,160
The attacks occurred
at precisely the same moment,

166
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,407
just over an hour ago,

167
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,322
at 4:00 A.M. eastern time.

168
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,907
Within minutes of the attack...

169
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,368
Congress ordered
an emergency recess

170
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,124
and the capitol building
was evacuated.

171
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,002
The president left Washington
on air force one.

172
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,378
The white house has declared
a state of emergency,

173
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,756
placing the military on highest alert.

174
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,963
Would you excuse us, please?

175
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,261
Dr. delbruuk.

176
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,306
We know who you are.

177
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,184
We read the manifesto,
we found your lab.

178
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,075
"There has never been peace

179
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,153
"without first a great suffering.

180
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,614
"The greater the suffering,
the greater the peace."

181
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,036
See, this will unite them, hmm?

182
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,794
When they read this manifesto,
they'll all understand.

183
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,588
Nobody's gonna read
that manifesto, ever.

184
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,541
I can promise you that.

185
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:42,967
What day is it?

186
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,627
How long have I been here?

187
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,342
What's the last thing you remember?

188
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,474
I was driving.

189
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,479
Someone hit me.

190
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,224
That was two weeks ago.

191
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,230
Two weeks?
Two weeks.

192
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,148
This is yours, isn't it?

193
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,644
It's how lark communicated with you.

194
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,195
Lark?
John lark.

195
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,524
We know all about him.
You know nothing.

196
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,234
There's information in this
phone that could lead us to him.

197
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,035
And you have the passcode.

198
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,409
You think lark is the enemy, hmm?

199
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,832
But you,

200
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,956
well, whoever you are,
you are the enemy.

201
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,628
You're why the system survives.

202
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,669
Why the suffering goes on.
Shut up!

203
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,172
We don't care about you.
We want lark.

204
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,503
What if we make a deal?

205
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,882
No, there's no deal, Luther.

206
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,926
Step outside.

207
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,346
Give me five minutes with this guy.

208
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,928
Ethan, I can't let you do that.
That's not who we are.

209
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,560
Then maybe we need to reconsider that.

210
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,982
What if they read
the manifesto on the air?

211
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,069
What? You can do that?

212
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,735
We can do it with a phone call.

213
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,651
Well, if he reads
lark's manifesto...

214
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:47,743
No.

215
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,533
I'll give you the passcode.

216
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,611
Ethan! Ethan!

217
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,409
Think, Ethan.

218
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,285
Think of the greater good, please.

219
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,158
Yeah, you do that.

220
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:05,837
Hmm?

221
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:11,933
Sir.

222
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,179
No, he won't cooperate.

223
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,021
Yes, sir. If we read the manifesto

224
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,560
on the air.

225
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,560
I'm sorry, sir.

226
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,655
Trading and global markets plummeted.

227
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:39,664
Stand by. I'm told we're about
fo get some additional information.

228
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:44,251
I've just been handed a document
from nils delbruuk,

229
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,298
a nuclear weapons specialist

230
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,423
who claims to have built the weapons
used in these attacks.

231
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:53,640
I've been asked to read
this manifesto in its entirety.

232
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,720
"There has never been peace

233
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,473
"without first a great suffering.

234
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,805
"The greater the suffering,
the greater the peace.

235
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,937
"As mankind is drawn
to his self-destruction

236
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,768
"like a moth to the candle,

237
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,728
"the so-called defenders of peace,

238
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,657
"the church, the government, the law,

239
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,735
"work tirelessly
to save humanity from itself."

240
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,366
it's not gonna help you now.

241
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,242
"But by averting disaster,

242
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,948
"they serve to delay a peace..."

243
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,249
what's done is done.

244
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,419
"That can only come through
an inevitable baptism of fire.

245
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,714
"The suffering I bring you
is not the beginning of the end.

246
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:27,881
"It is the beginning

247
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,321
"of a greater mutual understanding..."

248
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,676
did we get it?

249
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,087
“It is the first step

250
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,618
"toward the ultimate
brotherhood of man."

251
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,757
we got it.

252
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,342
"The suffering I bring you

253
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,973
"is the bridge to ultimate peace."

254
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,730
Go.

255
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,031
Did we get it?

256
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,703
Of course we got it.

257
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,463
I told you we'd get it.

258
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,878
I... I don't understand.

259
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,134
The attacks didn't happen?

260
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,930
The car accident you were in,
that was an hour ago.

261
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,803
I was driving the other car.

262
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,059
What's done is done,

263
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,886
when we say it's done.

264
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,013
Sir.

265
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,135
That phone you unlocked led us
to a server in Iceland

266
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,091
where we managed to
decrypt a communiqué

267
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,768
between John lark
and this woman:

268
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,312
Alana mitsopolis,
activist and philanthropist,

269
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,515
whose charity work

270
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,045
has earned her
the nickname the white widow.

271
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,687
It's all a front for her real trade:
Arms dealing, money laundering.

272
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,318
Extensive political connections
provide her with protection.

273
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,844
Lark and the widow
are meeting tonight

274
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,951
to negotiate delivery
of an unspecified package,

275
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,905
which we can only assume
is our missing plutonium.

276
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,992
They'll make contact in a private lounge
at the grand palais in Paris

277
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,576
during her annual
fundraising event.

278
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:09,877
The details are in the file.

279
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,191
If lark isn't there by midnight,

280
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,171
the widow will leave

281
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,939
and sell the package
to the highest bidder.

282
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:18,507
Which gives you
two hours from now to find lark.

283
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,930
Sir, I think there's something
you need to know.

284
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,632
I'm gonna stop you right there.

285
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,469
You had a terrible choice
to make in Berlin:

286
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,269
Recover the plutonium or save your team.

287
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,316
You chose your team,
and now the world is at risk.

288
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,146
Some flaw deep in your core being

289
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,650
simply won't allow you to choose
between one life and millions.

290
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,356
You see that as a sign of weakness.

291
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,067
To me, that's your greatest strength.

292
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,904
It also tells me I can count on you
to cover my ass.

293
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,434
Because coming over here from the CIA

294
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,164
was a lateral move,
some say a step down.

295
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,661
But I did it

296
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,663
because of you.

297
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,829
Don't make me regret it.

298
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,433
Make the call.

299
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,392
Shut 'em down.

300
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,388
What do you think you're doing, Erika?

301
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,902
It may be your mission,

302
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,079
but this is the CIA's plane.

303
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,872
It doesn't take off without my say-so.

304
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,199
We don't have time for this.

305
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,159
I have a team in Paris
ready to grab lark

306
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,790
as soon as he leaves the palais.

307
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,748
A g5 standing by
to rendition him to gitmo,

308
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,042
where a waterboard is waiting.

309
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:41,586
Spend 24 hours we don't have
to pull a confession we can't trust

310
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,844
from a man we haven't
positively identified? No.

311
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,596
We need reliable intelligence,
and we need it now.

312
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,349
This scenario is precisely
why the imf exists!

313
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,805
The imf is Halloween, Alan.

314
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,609
A bunch of grown men in rubber masks
playing trick-or-treat.

315
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,153
And if he had held on to
the plutonium in Berlin,

316
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,276
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

317
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,652
And his team would be dead.

318
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,699
Yes. They would.

319
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,118
That's the job.

320
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,697
And that's why I want
one of my own men on the scene

321
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,828
to appraise the situation.

322
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,494
Agent Walker,
special activities.

323
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,000
His reputation precedes.

324
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:18,797
You use a scalpel.

325
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,466
I prefer a hammer.

326
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,714
The answer is no.

327
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,512
I have operational authority here,
direct from the president.

328
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,868
You have a problem with that,
you take it up with him.

329
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,476
I have already, and he agrees
with me. My man goes

330
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,599
or no one goes.

331
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,647
No one comes between
you and that plutonium.

332
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,779
Not hunt, not his team, not anyone.

333
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:07,134
The white widow has spies
at every level of government.

334
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,636
This plane is posing
as a commercial airliner

335
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,888
so we can jump into France undetected.

336
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:15,055
The widow's meeting lark
in the vip lounge at midnight.

337
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:18,141
No one will be admitted without
a pre-issued electronic I.D. Band.

338
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,605
We have acquired
the unique rfid number

339
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,687
for lark's band,
allowing us to locate it

340
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,738
with these.

341
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,316
Find that I.D. Band, you find lark.

342
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:29,493
Then what?

343
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,490
Then...

344
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:37,786
I assume his identity
and make contact with the widow.

345
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,290
She takes us to the package.

346
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,461
People actually fall for this shit?

347
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,793
How do you intend
to make lark cooperate?

348
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,551
I bump him in the crowd.

349
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,633
In ten seconds he'll look like
any other drunk at the party,

350
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,559
incoherent and completely pliable.

351
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,186
After I borrow his face,

352
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:59,153
you walk him out the front door and
hand him to Sloane's extraction team.

353
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,226
You're not getting rid of me
that easily, hunt.

354
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,981
That's not what this is about.

355
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,778
Sure itis.

356
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,652
I know you don't want me
on this detail.

357
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,324
But let's face it:

358
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,242
If you'd made
the hard choice in Berlin,

359
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,740
I wouldn't be here.

360
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,163
And if you hadn't gunned down

361
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,332
every syndicate agent
they sent you to find,

362
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:17,958
I wouldn't be here.

363
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,327
That's right, I know all about you.

364
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,414
You're why we don't have a living
witness who can identify John lark

365
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,215
or the apostles.

366
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,839
If you have a problem
with my methods,

367
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,886
you can always stay behind.

368
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:33,466
"Your mission, should you
choose to accept it."

369
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,347
Isn't that the thing?

370
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,554
Two minutes to decompression.

371
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:42,642
Suit up. The widow is meeting lark
in 30 minutes.

372
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,410
Ten seconds to decompression.

373
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,873
Is your oxygen on?

374
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,385
There is no atmosphere
at this altitude.

375
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,258
I don't need you
blacking out on me.

376
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,889
Hey, your heads-up display has
a built-in guidance system.

377
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,021
Open your chute when the system says,

378
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,769
not before and definitely not after,

379
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,546
or the last thing that
goes through your mind

380
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,356
will be your kneecaps. Is that clear?

381
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:27,527
Crystal.

382
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,840
We got to talk. We need to rethink this.

383
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,216
Out of my way, hunt.

384
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:55,243
Walker, we've got a problem.
There's a storm. We need to...

385
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,223
Enough talk.

386
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:58,972
I'll see you in Paris.

387
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:07,477
Come on, come on, come on.

388
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:23,042
Altitude: 25,000 feet.

389
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:29,676
Walker?

390
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,048
What's the matter, hunt?
You afraid of a little lightning?

391
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:44,601
Altitude: 20,000 feet.

392
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:46,273
Son of a bitch.

393
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,442
Walker?

394
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,274
Do you copy?

395
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:55,032
Walker?

396
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,280
Walker?

397
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:08,416
Come on.

398
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,214
Altitude: 15,000 feet.

399
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:15,798
Walker.

400
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:17,884
Walker!

401
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,062
Walker!

402
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,231
Walker!

403
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:35,064
Altitude: 10,000 feet.

404
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,610
9,000.

405
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:40,990
Oh, shit.

406
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,740
8,000.

407
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:49,245
7,000.

408
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,170
6,000.

409
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,837
5,000.

410
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:02,929
4,000.

411
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,270
Walker!

412
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:05,765
Walker!

413
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:07,687
3,000.

414
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,182
Deploy. Deploy. Deploy.

415
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,563
Deploy. Deploy. Deploy.

416
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,770
Deploy. Deploy.

417
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,251
Oh, god.

418
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,228
Looks like you lost your oxygen.

419
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,298
That's where the widow is meeting lark.

420
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:01,262
Ethan.

421
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,379
Walker.
Ethan, if you can hear me,

422
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,473
I've got him.

423
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,303
Say again. Where?

424
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,264
He's headed for the bathroom.

425
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:06,502
Where's the needle?
Didn't need it.

426
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,837
Get him up.

427
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,959
Hey, hey.

428
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:00,727
Don't be shy, the more the merrier.

429
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:01,859
Come on, we re not mean.

430
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:02,891
Can we join you?

431
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:05,110
Can we join you? We won't bite, guys.

432
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,219
Shit.

433
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:24,537
Can you still make a mask?
I need a face to make a mask.

434
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:27,916
Sorry. I was aiming for his chest.

435
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:31,673
What are you doing here?
It's good to see you, too.

436
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,297
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
You are...

437
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:37,796
An old friend.

438
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,856
Cancel extraction.
We're code blue.

439
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,313
Send sanitation.

440
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,490
North men's room.

441
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:02,325
You didn't answer my question.
What are you doing here?

442
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,375
That's it. Just take it easy.
That's it.

443
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,422
Just keep your head back
until the bleeding stops.

444
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:10,586
What is it, eh?

445
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,956
You want some, too?

446
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,964
You're not here
by accident. Who sent you?

447
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,553
I can't tell you that.

448
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,640
What are you doing?

449
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,952
I have a date with the white widow.

450
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,467
He had a date with the widow.
You look nothing like him.

451
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:26,178
And now we have to hope
they never met.

452
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:29,106
Hope is not a strategy!
Oh, you must be new.

453
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:30,526
I have no other choice.

454
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,191
The white widow's our only lead.

455
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,714
I got to be this guy for five minutes.

456
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,524
Don't do it.
What?

457
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,611
What is it?
What aren't you telling me?

458
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,388
You don't understand
what you're involved in.

459
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,027
I don't understand
what I'm involved in.

460
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,867
I don't understand
what I'm involved in?

461
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,825
What am I involved in?

462
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,753
If you're meeting the widow,
she leaves in three minutes.

463
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,706
Ethan!
I'll make it work.

464
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,507
Ethan!
I'll make it work.

465
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,428
The name's Walker.

466
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,631
Yeah? You're welcome.

467
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,014
What do you think you're doing?

468
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,640
I'm going with you.
Like hell you are.

469
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,808
People have been sent here to kill lark.

470
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:26,832
No shit.

471
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,032
No, not me. Contractors. Paid assassins.

472
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:30,861
They don't know what he looks like,

473
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,607
they only know he's meeting
the widow at midnight.

474
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:33,871
If you go through with this,

475
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,277
they're gonna believe you're lark
and they're gonna kill you.

476
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,666
How do you know all this?

477
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,086
I can't tell you that.

478
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,719
You should've stayed out of the game.

479
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,640
You should've come with me.

480
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:01,565
This charity was started
in honor of my mother.

481
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:05,076
Those of you who knew her
understood her strength,

482
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,075
her tenacity, her resourcefulness.

483
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,992
But there was another side to her,

484
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,078
a side most people never saw.

485
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,880
It is that part of her spirit
that has brought us

486
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,753
all together tonight.

487
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,420
Max was something of a paradox.

488
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,182
She had a fascination for paradoxes,

489
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:31,770
a fascination she passed on to me.

490
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:37,775
Max had no illusions about
the world we live in today.

491
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,693
But she had dreams
of a very different future.

492
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:46,201
One in which her unique talents
were no longer required.

493
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,529
All she earned from the way the world is

494
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:53,621
went ultimately to making it
what it could someday be.

495
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,620
That future isn't here yet.

496
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:02,585
Tonight, your contributions
have brought it just a little closer.

497
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,089
Thank you all for coming.

498
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,765
Enjoy the party.

499
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,365
You can't possibly be John lark.

500
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:38,544
I'm not, actually.

501
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,043
It's an alias.

502
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,797
I suppose it's better than John Doe.

503
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,199
Is there another name you prefer?

504
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,963
Is there somewhere
we could talk privately?

505
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,299
In fact I like "lark."
It does have a certain ring.

506
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:52,496
We don't have a lot of time.

507
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,056
'Cause I'll be honest.

508
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:56,479
A man of your reputation,
I was expecting someone

509
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,143
uglier.

510
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:01,651
Don't let looks deceive.
I'm as ugly as they come.

511
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,483
And I'll be honest with you.
Your life is in danger.

512
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,323
Don't you touch her.

513
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,401
Relax. It's my brother.

514
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,278
You're being rude to our guest, zola.

515
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,163
It's time to go.

516
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,662
Don't turn this into a scene.

517
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,377
You don't want to be with this one.

518
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,717
You were saying?
Your life is in danger.

519
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:31,510
And who would want to kill me?

520
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:33,057
The Americans, for starters.

521
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,718
If that were true, I would know it.

522
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:37,478
You think you're the only one
with spies in the government?

523
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,899
There are people here
who don't want this meeting to happen.

524
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:42,567
Don't believe me?

525
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:44,569
Look around.

526
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,199
I know what you're thinking.

527
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,667
Maybe they're not here for you.

528
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,791
Maybe they're just here for me.

529
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,293
Are you willing to take that chance?

530
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,126
You have something I want.

531
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,678
Right now, that makes me
the only person you can trust

532
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,630
to get you out of here alive.

533
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:15,308
Or would you rather leave that
to your brother?

534
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:23,141
I think I'd like
to go home now, Mr. lark.

535
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,912
The French government took receipt
of the asset at noon today.

536
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,365
Delivery will be via air
to the finance ministry

537
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,659
at 8:00 A.M. tomorrow morning.

538
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,167
An armored motorcade
under heavy police escort

539
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,166
will transport him via this route.

540
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:52,507
We'll create a diversion
at this intersection, here.

541
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:56,553
The motorcade will automatically take
the preplanned alternate route here,

542
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,214
where we'll extract the asset.

543
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,307
Extract the asset?

544
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:14,737
The asset.

545
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:19,693
We paid a great deal of money
for this information.

546
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,369
They gave us everything
but this man's name.

547
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:24,994
You don't happen to know
who he is, do you?

548
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:27,867
His name is Solomon Lane.

549
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,624
British special agent turned anarchist.

550
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,668
He used rogue covert operatives

551
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,046
to create a terror network
called the syndicate.

552
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,963
Sabotage, assassination, mass murder.

553
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:42,299
As ugly as they come.

554
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:46,307
He was captured
by American agents two years ago.

555
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:49,605
Since then, he's been in
a never-ending interrogation,

556
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,899
passed around from
one government to another

557
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,398
to answer for his crimes.

558
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,732
You seem displeased, lark.

559
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:03,407
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.

560
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,747
I came to Paris for plutonium.

561
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,576
Well, there must be a misunderstanding.

562
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,581
I'm just a broker.

563
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,754
I connect a buyer and a seller.

564
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:18,168
My seller's not interested in cash,
so if you want the plutonium...

565
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,503
Extract Lane

566
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,846
and make a trade.

567
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:24,511
That's right.

568
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,272
How do I know
the seller has what I want?

569
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,793
A down payment in good faith.

570
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,464
A courier will deliver
two more within 48 hours

571
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:59,292
in exchange for him.

572
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:08,728
All right.

573
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:11,687
What happens after the diversion?

574
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,694
Kill everyone?

575
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,401
That's your plan?

576
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,744
There will be no withesses.

577
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:53,743
What's my guarantee that Lane
walks out of this thing alive?

578
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,286
He's in an armored box.

579
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:57,998
We'll pull him out when it's safe.

580
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:00,004
You want your plutonium,

581
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,248
this is the price.

582
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,714
Or do you draw the line at killing cops?

583
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:09,013
That's John lark you're talking to.

584
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:15,349
I murder women and children
with smallpox.

585
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,390
I have no line.

586
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,729
Right.

587
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:28,108
Sleep well, everyone. Busy day tomorrow.

588
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,213
You have got to be kidding me.

589
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:53,049
If you want Lane out of prison,
this is how it gets done.

590
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:56,223
I wanted lark to break him out,
not Ethan hunt.

591
00:46:56,314 --> 00:47:00,148
I wanted lark at the exchange,
not Ethan hunt.

592
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:03,351
I wanted lark to lead us
to the plutonium

593
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:05,232
and the apostles.

594
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:06,523
You may still get your chance.

595
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,760
Have you forgotten about
the corpse we pulled

596
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,220
out of the men's room
at the grand palais?

597
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,030
I'm guessing that wasn't lark.

598
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:13,531
More likely one of lark's recruits.

599
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,829
Not according to our intelligence.

600
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,119
Intelligence gathered by whom?

601
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:21,752
Hunt.

602
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:26,048
You've long held suspicions that lark
was an American agent.

603
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:27,750
Someone who knew our every move.

604
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,052
Someone who could
come and go like a ghost.

605
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,090
You're suggesting hunt is John lark.

606
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:39,304
You're reaching, Walker.
Trying to save your ass.

607
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,138
It won't work.

608
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:44,559
Think about it.
Would a man as careful as lark

609
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,689
really stick his neck out like that?

610
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,772
For a face-to-face with the white widow?

611
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,573
He'd send a proxy.
A decoy.

612
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,442
And if he was really smart,

613
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,153
he'd have his lady friend
kill that decoy

614
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,159
in front of a reliable witness.

615
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,250
Me.

616
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:02,706
The dragnet is closing in
on his terrorist alter ego.

617
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:05,709
So he pays a man
to play the part of lark

618
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,960
and has him killed.

619
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:10,214
And under the guise
of serving his country...

620
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,886
Assumes his own secret identity.

621
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,550
Free to operate at will

622
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:16,402
with the full support
of the U.S. government.

623
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:17,641
Why?

624
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,976
Why would hunt turn?

625
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:23,306
Why did Lane do it?
Why did any of his apostles?

626
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:26,810
They were believers in a cause.

627
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,395
And when that cause
turned out to be a lie,

628
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:32,277
they turned
against their masters.

629
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:35,576
How many times has hunt's
government betrayed him,

630
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:37,403
disavowed him, cast him aside?

631
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:40,494
And how long before
a man like that

632
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,366
has had enough?

633
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:45,665
That 1s a serious accusation.

634
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:48,831
Can you prove it?

635
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,382
This is the phone
we pulled off the dead body

636
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:55,838
at the grand palais.

637
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,642
I'm guessing
it has all the proof you need.

638
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:10,728
Is it true Lane gassed
a village of 2,000 people?

639
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:14,237
Yes.

640
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,778
Is it true he brought down
an entire passenger plane

641
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:17,865
just to kill one man?

642
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:20,611
Yes.

643
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:23,740
Is it true that he...
Hey, Walker.

644
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:26,910
Whatever you heard,
if it makes your skin crawl,

645
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,582
it's probably true.

646
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:36,082
Holy shit.

647
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,002
You're the guy
that caught him, aren't you?

648
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:42,929
How long do you think

649
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:44,507
he's gonna keep that to himself?

650
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:50,813
We'll burn that bridge
when we get to it.

651
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,372
What the hell is he doing?

652
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,680
Hunt? Where are you?

653
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:37,507
Don't wait for me!

654
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:40,185
What is it? What's wrong?

655
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:41,682
I'll meet you at the garage.

656
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:52,989
Benji, do you copy?

657
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:54,820
We copy. Go.

658
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:58,029
Change of plan. I'm blown.
Need extraction.

659
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,704
We're on our way.

660
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:18,132
He's heading from notre dame to the
St. Louis bridge. Units are in pursuit...

661
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:40,779
Stop.

662
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:42,737
Stay where you are.

663
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:44,742
Get in the car.

664
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:46,869
Nobody move.

665
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:51,457
Show me your hands.

666
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:54,916
Walk away...

667
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:55,579
Walk away... please.

668
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:56,292
Everyone...

669
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:57,536
Everyone... show me your hands.

670
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,384
Just walk away...

671
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:06,503
Just walk away... please.

672
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:17,143
Zola wants a word with you.

673
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:22,523
What about her?

674
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:23,989
Finish her.

675
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,018
You'll be all right.

676
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:05,479
We got to go.

677
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:08,572
I'm so sorry.

678
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:09,576
Come on.

679
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:47,645
The name's Walker, by the way.

680
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,065
Was the little car your idea?

681
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:01,455
Jesus Christ!

682
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:04,000
What the hell was that?

683
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,262
Everybody out.
Go, go, go!

684
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:50,795
That was Ilsa.

685
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:52,839
Shut up.

686
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:54,924
Very interesting.

687
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:00,721
It's good to see you again, Ethan.

688
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:40,387
Oh, look who's still alive.

689
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:45,971
There's a microwave tracker in his neck.

690
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:47,677
Got it. You know what to do.

691
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:49,979
Let me just assure you, this won't hurt

692
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:51,431
enough.

693
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:56,107
Ninety seconds.

694
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:58,117
You and your apostles think
we're gonna trade you

695
01:07:58,157 --> 01:07:59,863
for the missing plutonium.

696
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:02,567
I'm here to tell you
that's never gonna happen.

697
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:06,029
"Your mission, should you
choose to accept it."

698
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,872
I wonder, Ethan,

699
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,450
did you ever choose not to?

700
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:12,793
Did you ever stop and ask yourself

701
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,713
who it was giving you the orders or why?

702
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:18,249
While every day the master you serve

703
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:20,505
moves one step closer
to ending the world.

704
01:08:20,972 --> 01:08:23,088
Strange accusation
coming from a terrorist.

705
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:24,297
Sixty seconds.

706
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:26,428
Terrorists are schoolboys
desperate for attention,

707
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:30,228
hoping to shape
public opinion through fear.

708
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:33,557
I don't care in the least
what people think or feel.

709
01:08:33,985 --> 01:08:36,351
In my experience,
they don't do either for very long.

710
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:38,528
Oh, and I suppose that
justifies bombing factories

711
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:40,151
or bringing down civilian aircraft.

712
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:42,774
Or strapping me
into an explosive vest!

713
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:45,952
Consider it unfinished business,
my funny little friend.

714
01:08:46,164 --> 01:08:47,950
Luther?
Almost there.

715
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:50,157
You see the end
as clearly as I do, Ethan.

716
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:52,993
Governments the world over
are descending into madness.

717
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:57,206
The syndicate was created
to tear them down, brick by brick.

718
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,291
The syndicate was
a pack of murdering cowards.

719
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:03,048
The syndicate
was civilization's last hope!

720
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:06,552
A chance to smash the old world order.

721
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:08,925
That hope is gone now
because of you

722
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:11,640
and your pathetic morality.

723
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:15,477
You should have killed me, Ethan.

724
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:20,061
The end you've always feared

725
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:22,029
is coming.

726
01:09:24,452 --> 01:09:26,113
It's coming!

727
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:30,867
And the blood will be on your hands.

728
01:09:33,211 --> 01:09:34,792
The fallout

729
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:38,538
of all your good intentions.

730
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:46,762
Time.
Got it.

731
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:12,705
Get him up.

732
01:10:15,503 --> 01:10:16,868
You're mine now.

733
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:28,171
You're just
full of surprises, lark.

734
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:30,598
Your brother's plan
was bad from the word go.

735
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:32,846
You'd have lost all your men

736
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:34,777
and Lane would've been killed
in the crossfire.

737
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:37,059
I had to improvise.

738
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:40,190
Well, why not say that
in the first place?

739
01:10:40,278 --> 01:10:42,064
Because I don't
trust your people.

740
01:10:42,155 --> 01:10:44,441
Especially not your brother.

741
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:51,027
Family. What can you do?

742
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,991
So, where's Lane?

743
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:58,326
Certainly not at the bottom
of the seine.

744
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:00,161
I have him. He's safe.

745
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,671
Where do I meet the courier?

746
01:11:04,302 --> 01:11:05,633
Let's talk about the woman.

747
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:09,132
Woman?

748
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:10,675
She was with you at the palais.

749
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:12,132
Zola saw her again today.

750
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:13,967
She tried to kill Lane.

751
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:16,143
She had the chance to kill you,
but she didn't.

752
01:11:16,564 --> 01:11:17,564
Why?

753
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:23,150
We have a past.

754
01:11:24,489 --> 01:11:25,820
It's complicated.

755
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,282
Well, I'll make it
more complicated for you.

756
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:32,778
My price just went up.

757
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:35,033
Someone killed four of my men today.

758
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:36,705
I'm assuming it was her.

759
01:11:43,049 --> 01:11:44,960
I want her, lark.

760
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:47,542
And you're gonna bring her to me.

761
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:50,419
Otherwise, you don't meet the courier

762
01:11:50,515 --> 01:11:52,881
and the plutonium goes
to the highest bidder.

763
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:56,600
I'd hate for her
to come between us.

764
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:02,148
She's yours.

765
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:05,484
At the meeting. Not before.

766
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:19,290
Go to London.

767
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:22,209
Instructions will follow.

768
01:14:03,731 --> 01:14:06,598
I knew if I followed her,
you'd show up eventually.

769
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:08,232
Are you okay?

770
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:11,860
Lisa, I never wanted to hurt you.

771
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:14,030
I know you have your reasons.

772
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:15,735
I know.

773
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,533
You need to walk away.

774
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:22,955
I can't do that.

775
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:27,206
You weren't at the palais to kill lark.

776
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:28,411
No.

777
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:31,793
You were there to protect him.

778
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:33,503
Yes.

779
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:35,380
And you killed him to protect me.

780
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:40,139
You wanted lark to break Lane out.

781
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:45,011
No. You needed him to break Lane out.

782
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:47,931
Because you have to kill Lane.

783
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,274
Who's making you do this?

784
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:54,486
Mig.

785
01:14:57,118 --> 01:14:58,118
Why?

786
01:14:58,369 --> 01:15:00,200
After we captured him in London,

787
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:03,575
they tried to bring Lane home
through diplomatic channels.

788
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:06,328
But too many countries
want their pound of flesh.

789
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:08,330
A man like that, what he's seen,

790
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:09,982
what he knows
about British intelligence,

791
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:13,373
they can't have him talking
to a foreign government ever.

792
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:15,128
That's not what I'm asking.

793
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,426
Why did they send you?

794
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,926
This is how I prove my loyalty.

795
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:23,132
This is how I come home.

796
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:25,013
But you were out.

797
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:26,514
You were free.

798
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:28,345
We are never free.

799
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:31,983
I spent two years undercover with Lane.

800
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:34,776
To them, I'm as much
of a threat as he is.

801
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:39,323
I kill him, or I never stop running.

802
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:44,032
Now tell me where he is.

803
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:50,534
I can't help you.

804
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:53,336
I will get to him one way or another.

805
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:56,916
Please don't make me go through you.

806
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:54,098
Yes.

807
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:55,979
Are you here in London?

808
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:57,355
I am.

809
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:59,437
Are you ready to meet the courier?

810
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:02,277
Yes. Where do I go?

811
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:04,324
Where would you like to meet?

812
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:43,491
Mr. secretary.

813
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,742
I prayed to god that it wasn't true.

814
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,410
Well, in his defense, sir,

815
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:49,953
if Ethan hadn't intervened,

816
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,434
a great many people
would have been killed.

817
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:53,699
Yes, Dunn, I'm sure that
the good people of Paris

818
01:17:53,794 --> 01:17:56,957
and the nation of France as a whole
will take that into account.

819
01:17:58,090 --> 01:17:59,751
So what the hell happened?

820
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:21,485
At which point, we were
told to come to London

821
01:18:22,156 --> 01:18:23,646
and await further instructions.

822
01:18:23,908 --> 01:18:25,239
And what happens now?

823
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:27,115
Now,

824
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:29,743
we meet the widow in 20 minutes.

825
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:31,320
She'll take us to a courier

826
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:34,498
who'll hand over our missing plutonium
in exchange for Solomon Lane.

827
01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:36,166
Or, in our scenario,

828
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:38,619
Benji.

829
01:18:39,048 --> 01:18:40,163
Jesus.

830
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:41,584
I'm sorry, what?

831
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:43,278
Luther and I are gonna
take you to the courier.

832
01:18:43,302 --> 01:18:44,982
Walker stays here
and guards the real Lane.

833
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:46,134
Absolutely not.

834
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:47,574
Wait, wait.
Why do I have to be Lane?

835
01:18:47,598 --> 01:18:48,598
Benji.

836
01:18:48,682 --> 01:18:51,515
Our mission, my mission,
is to recover that plutonium,

837
01:18:51,602 --> 01:18:53,684
and I will do so at any cost.

838
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:55,432
Even if I have to trade Lane.

839
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:56,932
The real Lane.

840
01:18:57,024 --> 01:18:59,060
And I will never let him go.

841
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:02,143
When the apostles realize
that you're playing games,

842
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:04,524
you'll lose the plutonium. Again.

843
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:06,613
You let us worry about the apostles.

844
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:09,112
As it stands, we have a bigger problem.

845
01:19:09,203 --> 01:19:10,659
A bigger problem?

846
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:12,903
Ilsa.
Lisa?

847
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:14,534
Our Lisa? Ilsa faust Lisa?

848
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:15,810
How is she mixed up in all of this?

849
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:18,166
She's been ordered
to kill Lane. Direct from MI6.

850
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:21,667
Look, wait. So that was her
in Paris? On the bike.

851
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:22,792
Yeah.

852
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:24,089
Ethan, she tried to kill us!

853
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:25,382
No, not us. Not us.
Yeah.

854
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:27,710
Lane. She tried to kill Lane.
She has no choice.

855
01:19:27,805 --> 01:19:28,840
And she will kill me!

856
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:30,116
I'm not gonna let that happen.

857
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:32,220
Ethan, how exactly are you
not gonna let that happen?

858
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:35,934
I'm working on it.
Oh, he's working on it.

859
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:37,457
Right now,
we don't have a lot of time.

860
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:39,000
We have to get ready for this meeting.

861
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:40,480
The meeting is a trap.

862
01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:43,776
The white widow is working with the CIA.

863
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:45,398
She has been since the beginning.

864
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:49,319
Bargaining for immunity
is her stock-in-trade.

865
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:51,947
Capturing the plutonium,
and the apostles, and John lark

866
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:54,494
buys her a lot of goodwill
with the Americans.

867
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:57,448
But if Sloane knew the meeting was
a trap, why didn't she just tell us?

868
01:19:57,543 --> 01:19:59,579
Because, in her mind,
anybody could be John lark,

869
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:01,410
including one of us.

870
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,667
And now her suspicions are confirmed.

871
01:20:07,177 --> 01:20:08,587
According to that dossier,

872
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:11,136
a trail of electronic evidence
connects hunt

873
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:14,385
to the theft of smallpox from the CDC.

874
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:16,842
It also links him
to a lengthy correspondence

875
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:18,973
ending with the recruitment
of Dr. delbruuk.

876
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:21,396
And, of course,
hunt handed over the plutonium

877
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:23,314
to the apostles himself.

878
01:20:23,402 --> 01:20:25,358
Now, those facts, coupled with

879
01:20:25,446 --> 01:20:28,153
a long and incriminating
history of rogue behavior,

880
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:30,776
corroborate a CIA narrative

881
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,658
that hunt has snapped.

882
01:20:34,163 --> 01:20:36,279
And that his search for lark
is nothing but a cover

883
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:38,204
to hide the fact that lark...

884
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:40,293
1s me.

885
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:44,753
I've got to hand it
to you, Ethan.

886
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,172
Normally, when people refer to you
as your own worst enemy,

887
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:48,840
it's just a figure of speech.

888
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:56,507
I'm afraid Sloane's got
some questions for her as well.

889
01:20:57,019 --> 01:20:59,681
The widow offered her up
at no extra charge.

890
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:02,225
And where did Sloane
get this information?

891
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:04,765
She didn't say.

892
01:21:05,152 --> 01:21:07,939
She did, however, Grant me
the opportunity to bring you in,

893
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:10,191
on the condition that
I terminate this mission

894
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:12,648
and hand over
Solomon Lane personally.

895
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:14,858
Sir, you can't do that.
Hunt.

896
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:17,490
I know Lane. And he has
no intention of going back.

897
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:18,946
That's why we're taking him back.

898
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:22,158
Which means that's exactly
what he wants us to do.

899
01:21:22,252 --> 01:21:23,372
Ethan...
Sir, what do you

900
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:24,622
think this 1s? A coincidence?

901
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:25,815
That someone just happened upon this?

902
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:28,455
Lane had it sent to her.
He knew how she would react.

903
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,415
Just like he knew
the widow would turn us in.

904
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:31,511
Don't you see?

905
01:21:31,845 --> 01:21:33,335
This, sir...

906
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,428
This is the trap.

907
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:37,381
We are being directed.
Hunt!

908
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:40,058
There are still two plutonium cores
in the wind!

909
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:42,431
And you lost them!

910
01:21:44,274 --> 01:21:46,890
In fairness, sir, we all lost them.

911
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:50,106
Respectfully, sir, you weren't there.

912
01:21:50,197 --> 01:21:52,688
So making excuses for him
is your full-time job now?

913
01:21:54,201 --> 01:21:57,193
Good god, Ethan, don't make this
any harder than it already is.

914
01:21:57,621 --> 01:22:00,454
I can no longer protect you,
don't you understand that?

915
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:03,283
This is as close as
you're ever gonna get to that plutonium.

916
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:05,208
Sir, you don't actually believe this.

917
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:07,627
I believe I've been given
a choice to protect you

918
01:22:07,714 --> 01:22:09,921
or the imf, which is why
I'm bringing you in.

919
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:12,758
And if I refuse?

920
01:22:12,845 --> 01:22:15,006
What do you think he's here for?

921
01:22:15,097 --> 01:22:16,337
You think he's some observer?

922
01:22:16,432 --> 01:22:17,888
He's an assassin!

923
01:22:17,975 --> 01:22:20,512
Erika Sloane's number-one plumber.

924
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:23,594
You go rogue, he's authorized
to hunt you down

925
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:25,437
and kill you.

926
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:31,273
It's the job.
No hard feelings.

927
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:33,236
Accept it, Ethan.

928
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:35,484
You've lost this one.
What's done is done.

929
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:39,409
No, sir. No.

930
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,617
I am not asking you.
I am giving you a direct order.

931
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:45,324
This mission is terminated.

932
01:22:46,003 --> 01:22:47,163
Now!

933
01:22:50,007 --> 01:22:51,372
Stickell, he's your friend.

934
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:53,027
Would you please talk
some sense into...

935
01:22:55,929 --> 01:22:58,511
I'm sorry, sir,
but you left me no choice.

936
01:23:00,726 --> 01:23:02,591
There's 15 minutes
before we meet the widow.

937
01:23:02,686 --> 01:23:04,330
You want the plutonium,
we're the only ones

938
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:06,310
who can get it for you. You in or out?

939
01:23:08,275 --> 01:23:09,275
In.

940
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:11,691
What are you doing?
Benji needs to get ready.

941
01:23:11,778 --> 01:23:13,643
No, Ethan...
There's no time, Luther.

942
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:15,400
I need you to trust me.

943
01:23:32,382 --> 01:23:33,713
You all right?

944
01:23:34,051 --> 01:23:35,382
Yeah, I just

945
01:23:35,886 --> 01:23:37,717
got a bad feeling about this one.

946
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:05,286
If you don't hear from us...

947
01:24:05,791 --> 01:24:07,372
I'll do it my way.

948
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:13,127
Don't take your eyes off him.

949
01:24:49,668 --> 01:24:51,579
Enough games.
I'm taking you out of here.

950
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:53,001
Where's hunt?

951
01:24:53,505 --> 01:24:55,666
He's gone to the meeting,
with a copy of you.

952
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:56,872
Calm down.

953
01:24:56,967 --> 01:24:58,628
Call the apostles. Warn them.

954
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,505
I have no way of contacting them.

955
01:25:00,596 --> 01:25:02,211
For their safety and mine.

956
01:25:02,306 --> 01:25:03,921
What I do have
is an extraction team with

957
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:06,257
satellite overwatch
and a prearranged rendezvous.

958
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:07,829
They'll know as soon as
we leave the building.

959
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:10,185
No, I'm staying here.

960
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:12,137
I haven't finished with hunt yet.

961
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:19,687
Why did you have to make this
so fucking complicated?

962
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:22,071
I don't understand what you mean.

963
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:23,865
The deal was simple.

964
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:27,160
I help you frame hunt,
you give me the plutonium.

965
01:25:27,247 --> 01:25:29,078
You're wasting time.

966
01:25:29,166 --> 01:25:32,203
"There cannot be peace without
first a great suffering.

967
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:35,290
"The greater the suffering,
the greater the peace."

968
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:36,746
When I wrote those words,

969
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:41,083
I wasn't referring to your peace
or hunt's suffering.

970
01:25:41,178 --> 01:25:43,294
The old world order
needs dismantling,

971
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:45,344
and we have the tools
to dismantle it.

972
01:25:45,432 --> 01:25:47,013
All you seem to care about

973
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:49,762
is that hunt lives to take the blame.

974
01:25:49,853 --> 01:25:51,514
That's not anarchy.

975
01:25:51,605 --> 01:25:53,141
That's revenge.

976
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:54,767
Yes, it is.

977
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:56,939
And when I have what I want,

978
01:25:57,819 --> 01:26:00,231
the apostles will give you
the plutonium.

979
01:26:04,242 --> 01:26:05,823
Hunt's the only friend you've got.

980
01:26:05,911 --> 01:26:06,946
You're only alive today

981
01:26:07,037 --> 01:26:09,028
because he didn't have
the guts to kill you.

982
01:26:09,122 --> 01:26:11,829
Sloane was right.
The imf is Halloween.

983
01:26:11,917 --> 01:26:14,158
Nothing but grown men wearing...

984
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:22,882
What?

985
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:31,429
It's just the job.
No hard feelings.

986
01:26:35,565 --> 01:26:37,556
I've ruined your day, haven't I?

987
01:26:39,152 --> 01:26:40,983
_oh!

988
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:43,858
And you were doing so well
up until then.

989
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:46,113
Now, I think this one's loaded.

990
01:26:46,576 --> 01:26:48,316
You want to find out?

991
01:27:30,454 --> 01:27:33,116
So, how'd I do?
I never had a doubt.

992
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:37,332
I'm beginning to see why
you guys enjoy this so much.

993
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:39,159
Hats off, Mr. secretary.

994
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:41,870
The man's a natural.
Welcome to the team, sir.

995
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:44,877
You're making a mistake.

996
01:27:44,968 --> 01:27:49,302
No, the mistake was mine
when I saved your life over Paris.

997
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:51,971
This proves nothing.
I'm playing a role,

998
01:27:52,058 --> 01:27:54,140
just like you are, trying to
recover that plutonium.

999
01:27:54,227 --> 01:27:56,764
That doesn't explain why
you gave Sloane the dossier

1000
01:27:56,855 --> 01:27:58,095
and tried to frame hunt.

1001
01:27:58,190 --> 01:27:59,726
He makes a good point,

1002
01:28:00,066 --> 01:28:01,066
lark.

1003
01:28:01,568 --> 01:28:03,729
He's paranoid. Delusional.

1004
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:05,731
Just like the dossier says.

1005
01:28:05,822 --> 01:28:07,528
So where did Sloane
get the dossier from?

1006
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:09,607
I have no idea.

1007
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:11,066
I do.

1008
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:15,536
Did you get all that, Erika?

1009
01:28:15,624 --> 01:28:16,989
I did.

1010
01:28:17,083 --> 01:28:19,574
I don't appreciate being used, Walker.

1011
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:23,412
Oops. Bad boy.

1012
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:25,742
Where would you
like him delivered?

1013
01:28:26,051 --> 01:28:27,962
I'll come to you.

1014
01:28:30,472 --> 01:28:32,463
Nobody move! Nobody move!

1015
01:28:32,557 --> 01:28:34,093
Weapons down! Drop 'em!

1016
01:28:34,434 --> 01:28:36,925
Hands in the air!
Weapons down!

1017
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:39,101
Drop it! Drop it!

1018
01:28:39,397 --> 01:28:40,728
Weapons down! Right now! You!

1019
01:28:40,816 --> 01:28:43,353
It's okay. It's okay. It's all right.

1020
01:28:44,277 --> 01:28:45,392
I thought we had a deal.

1021
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:48,319
We did. And now we don't.

1022
01:28:48,657 --> 01:28:51,990
There is too much at stake here
for me to take any chances.

1023
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:54,947
I'm bringing you all in,
along with Walker.

1024
01:28:55,121 --> 01:28:56,611
The plutonium is still out there!

1025
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:59,494
And I don't trust a living soul
in that room to get it.

1026
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:02,501
We'll sort out who's who in Washington.

1027
01:29:03,421 --> 01:29:04,877
Erikal
sir?

1028
01:29:05,382 --> 01:29:07,464
It's all right.
Let's just do what she says.

1029
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,251
The only real threats are in this room,
and we have them.

1030
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:15,930
Do you?

1031
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:18,015
Go.

1032
01:29:37,664 --> 01:29:39,245
Where the hell 1s Lane?

1033
01:30:09,905 --> 01:30:10,905
Ethan! Ethan!

1034
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:37,462
First team is down.
Send backup.

1035
01:30:39,726 --> 01:30:41,557
Sir!

1036
01:30:42,854 --> 01:30:45,015
Oh, no, no, no.
Man down! Man down!

1037
01:30:47,651 --> 01:30:48,891
Somebody help!

1038
01:30:57,911 --> 01:30:59,071
Sir.

1039
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:06,074
Ethan, I tagged Walker,
but he's on the run.

1040
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:07,579
You got to get him.

1041
01:31:12,425 --> 01:31:13,585
Go.

1042
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:16,717
I'm sorry, sir.

1043
01:31:18,598 --> 01:31:19,838
Go.

1044
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:31,770
Ethan?

1045
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:37,074
Wait!

1046
01:31:38,785 --> 01:31:40,275
Get that son of a bitch.

1047
01:32:09,107 --> 01:32:10,938
Come on, come on, come on.

1048
01:32:11,067 --> 01:32:12,307
Yes! I got him.

1049
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:24,781
I'm sorry.

1050
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:27,826
Talk to me, Benji. Where's Walker?

1051
01:32:27,917 --> 01:32:30,021
Benji. He's about a quarter mile west
if you turn right.

1052
01:32:30,045 --> 01:32:31,626
To my right?

1053
01:32:34,382 --> 01:32:35,872
I can't do that.

1054
01:32:36,134 --> 01:32:37,465
Why not?

1055
01:32:38,136 --> 01:32:39,626
Because I'm being followed.

1056
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:41,802
What do you mean? By who?

1057
01:32:42,057 --> 01:32:43,547
How do I know?
CIA, apostles...

1058
01:32:43,641 --> 01:32:44,972
What difference does it make?

1059
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:48,810
Okay, okay, just get
out of there and then go right.

1060
01:32:56,029 --> 01:32:57,940
I am terribly sorry.

1061
01:32:58,281 --> 01:32:59,612
Excuse me.

1062
01:33:16,633 --> 01:33:18,169
Why is he running in circles?

1063
01:33:45,161 --> 01:33:47,801
Okay, you need to cross the street
on your left as soon as you can.

1064
01:33:53,586 --> 01:33:54,792
Ethan, did you copy?

1065
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:57,165
Left, go left, now!
I'm working on it.

1066
01:34:08,518 --> 01:34:10,679
Now go across the street
right in front of you.

1067
01:34:18,111 --> 01:34:20,853
Ethan, he's getting away from you!
You're gonna have to go faster.

1068
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:54,260
You're gaining on him!
Go straight.

1069
01:34:56,733 --> 01:34:58,394
Straight? Keep going straight?

1070
01:34:58,735 --> 01:35:00,726
Go straight, go straight,
straight, straight.

1071
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:03,690
Okay, now turn right.

1072
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:04,948
Right?

1073
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:06,530
Now?

1074
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:08,316
Yes, right!
Are you sure?

1075
01:35:08,494 --> 01:35:09,654
Yes, I'm...

1076
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:11,786
No, it's left! Turn left!

1077
01:35:11,873 --> 01:35:13,738
Sorry, I had the screen-lock on.

1078
01:35:17,587 --> 01:35:18,918
Left.

1079
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:23,623
Thank you.

1080
01:35:30,266 --> 01:35:33,258
What are you waiting for?
I'm jumping out a window!

1081
01:35:33,353 --> 01:35:35,139
What do you mean,
you're jumping out of a...

1082
01:35:37,273 --> 01:35:39,059
Oh, sorry. I had it in 2d.

1083
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:40,769
Good luck.

1084
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:16,922
At the end of the bridge,
turn left. You've almost got him.

1085
01:36:21,067 --> 01:36:23,103
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, Ethan, get him!

1086
01:36:23,194 --> 01:36:24,274
You're right on top of him!

1087
01:36:39,252 --> 01:36:40,562
That's it, he's right in front of you!

1088
01:36:40,586 --> 01:36:41,701
Get him! Get him! Get him!

1089
01:37:17,874 --> 01:37:21,366
You can't do it, can you?
Not until you get your plutonium.

1090
01:37:22,295 --> 01:37:25,537
No. He still has plans for you.

1091
01:37:26,632 --> 01:37:29,715
You're gonna turn yourself in
and admit you're John lark,

1092
01:37:30,053 --> 01:37:33,136
then watch the old world implode
from your dark little cell.

1093
01:37:33,222 --> 01:37:34,758
And if I don't?

1094
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:49,356
I'm her guardian angel, hunt.

1095
01:37:50,990 --> 01:37:53,902
If I see you again, she dies.

1096
01:37:53,993 --> 01:37:56,609
If you try to warn her, she dies.

1097
01:37:56,996 --> 01:37:58,281
Know when you're beat.

1098
01:39:09,819 --> 01:39:11,434
These are the designs
we recovered

1099
01:39:11,529 --> 01:39:13,690
from Dr. delbruuk's lab in Berlin.

1100
01:39:13,781 --> 01:39:15,863
That's a five-megaton
nuclear device.

1101
01:39:15,950 --> 01:39:17,636
That's greater than
all the explosive energy

1102
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:18,695
released in world war il.

1103
01:39:18,786 --> 01:39:22,449
To disarm it, normally
we'd cut the fuse wire here.

1104
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:23,996
What, "normally"?

1105
01:39:24,083 --> 01:39:26,916
Walker and Lane
have two plutonium cores,

1106
01:39:27,003 --> 01:39:28,368
meaning two bombs.

1107
01:39:28,713 --> 01:39:30,999
Yeah. And they're both linked
by a microwave fail-safe

1108
01:39:31,090 --> 01:39:32,943
which is accurate to
within one-tenth of a second.

1109
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:37,131
Any attempt to defuse one bomb
automatically triggers the other.

1110
01:39:37,430 --> 01:39:40,263
Meaning once armed,
the bombs cannot be disarmed.

1111
01:39:40,349 --> 01:39:43,011
The countdown is
started by a remote detonator,

1112
01:39:43,102 --> 01:39:45,093
which 1s also a fail-safe.

1113
01:39:45,188 --> 01:39:47,474
Meaning once the countdown starts,

1114
01:39:48,149 --> 01:39:49,480
it can't be stopped.

1115
01:39:51,068 --> 01:39:53,650
So the solution to this is?

1116
01:39:55,656 --> 01:39:57,146
We're working on it.

1117
01:39:58,743 --> 01:39:59,743
So,

1118
01:40:00,411 --> 01:40:02,823
technically, this is a suicide mission.

1119
01:40:13,925 --> 01:40:14,925
What is it?

1120
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:17,842
Have a seat. Please.

1121
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:23,840
In all the years
that I've known Ethan,

1122
01:40:24,185 --> 01:40:26,847
he's only been serious
about two women.

1123
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:29,679
One was his wife.

1124
01:40:30,441 --> 01:40:31,772
He's married?

1125
01:40:31,984 --> 01:40:33,975
No, he was.

1126
01:40:34,362 --> 01:40:36,102
Was? What happened to her?

1127
01:40:36,447 --> 01:40:37,812
Well, she was taken

1128
01:40:38,199 --> 01:40:40,861
by some people
who wanted to get to Ethan.

1129
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:43,742
It's okay,
he got her back in one piece.

1130
01:40:44,372 --> 01:40:45,908
Then he quit the game.

1131
01:40:46,916 --> 01:40:49,077
They were happy for a while.

1132
01:40:49,544 --> 01:40:52,502
But every time something bad
happened in the world,

1133
01:40:52,672 --> 01:40:55,084
Ethan would think,
"I should've been there."

1134
01:40:55,341 --> 01:40:57,923
And she would wonder,
"who's watching the world

1135
01:40:58,010 --> 01:41:00,001
"while Ethan's watching me?"

1136
01:41:00,429 --> 01:41:03,592
Deep down, they both knew
that someday, somehow,

1137
01:41:03,766 --> 01:41:06,758
something truly terrible
was going to happen

1138
01:41:08,229 --> 01:41:10,436
all because they were together.

1139
01:41:11,524 --> 01:41:12,604
So...

1140
01:41:14,986 --> 01:41:17,728
Where is she now?
She's a ghost.

1141
01:41:17,947 --> 01:41:19,278
Good at it, too.

1142
01:41:19,532 --> 01:41:21,193
Taught her myself.

1143
01:41:21,534 --> 01:41:23,900
Every now and then,
she sends up a signal

1144
01:41:23,995 --> 01:41:25,155
to let Ethan know she's safe.

1145
01:41:25,913 --> 01:41:27,824
And that keeps him going.

1146
01:41:29,166 --> 01:41:30,656
Why are you telling me this?

1147
01:41:32,503 --> 01:41:33,618
Hmm.

1148
01:41:34,589 --> 01:41:38,173
We're in this mess because
Ethan wouldn't let me die.

1149
01:41:40,761 --> 01:41:42,126
He's a good man.

1150
01:41:42,763 --> 01:41:46,472
And he cares about you
more than he can admit.

1151
01:41:47,602 --> 01:41:51,265
That's one more worry
than he can handle right now.

1152
01:41:53,858 --> 01:41:55,940
If you care about him,

1153
01:41:56,527 --> 01:41:58,017
you should walk away.

1154
01:42:01,532 --> 01:42:02,897
Luther...

1155
01:42:02,992 --> 01:42:04,482
Is everything all right?

1156
01:42:16,756 --> 01:42:18,462
I'm coming with you.

1157
01:42:27,433 --> 01:42:28,548
I know.

1158
01:42:32,688 --> 01:42:34,053
So how do we find him?

1159
01:42:35,775 --> 01:42:37,436
Microwave transponder.

1160
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:40,317
Traceable via satellite
anywhere in the world.

1161
01:42:40,655 --> 01:42:42,455
Lane had one of these
in the back of his neck.

1162
01:42:43,491 --> 01:42:44,606
We removed it in Paris.

1163
01:42:44,867 --> 01:42:47,028
At the same time,
we put our own transponder in.

1164
01:42:47,203 --> 01:42:48,283
Got it.

1165
01:42:50,247 --> 01:42:52,488
36-hour delayed activation,

1166
01:42:52,667 --> 01:42:55,079
in case Lane's apostles scan him.

1167
01:42:55,836 --> 01:42:57,827
So you planned on letting him go.

1168
01:42:58,005 --> 01:43:00,087
Not this way, but yes.

1169
01:43:00,341 --> 01:43:01,877
He's gonna lead us to the plutonium.

1170
01:43:02,176 --> 01:43:03,757
How can you be sure?

1171
01:43:03,928 --> 01:43:06,010
His plan to put me in prison
went to hell.

1172
01:43:07,181 --> 01:43:09,342
Now he's gonna want me there
for the end.

1173
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:11,431
So when does this transponder activate?

1174
01:43:11,519 --> 01:43:13,121
I got him. I got him,
I got him, I got him!

1175
01:43:13,145 --> 01:43:15,227
He's traveling east
over Europe at 500 knots.

1176
01:43:15,398 --> 01:43:16,398
He's airborne.

1177
01:43:16,565 --> 01:43:17,680
Shall we inform the CIA?

1178
01:43:18,275 --> 01:43:19,685
The CIA's been infiltrated.

1179
01:43:19,902 --> 01:43:22,268
I don't trust anybody
outside of this room.

1180
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:24,441
We're gonna have to go it alone.

1181
01:43:27,326 --> 01:43:28,326
So where do we go?

1182
01:43:48,723 --> 01:43:50,054
How we doing, Benji?

1183
01:43:50,516 --> 01:43:53,178
If there's a way to defuse these bombs,
I can't find it.

1184
01:43:53,352 --> 01:43:55,593
You'll figure it out.
I know you will.

1185
01:43:57,189 --> 01:43:59,521
Damn. Ethan, we lost the signal.

1186
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:01,515
Lane must've found our transmitter.

1187
01:44:01,902 --> 01:44:05,235
What's his last position?
About 30 miles northeast.

1188
01:44:05,489 --> 01:44:07,480
Then that's where he wants us to go.

1189
01:44:07,658 --> 01:44:09,489
What's there?
The nubra river valley.

1190
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:11,366
There's only a medical camp there.

1191
01:44:11,454 --> 01:44:13,820
Humanitarian aid overseas.

1192
01:44:14,165 --> 01:44:16,907
Why would Lane target a medical camp?

1193
01:44:17,543 --> 01:44:18,543
Smallpox.

1194
01:44:19,211 --> 01:44:20,211
What?

1195
01:44:20,296 --> 01:44:23,538
Smallpox. The apostles triggered
a smallpox outbreak in kashmir.

1196
01:44:24,049 --> 01:44:26,665
Lane must've wanted that camp there
for a reason.

1197
01:44:26,927 --> 01:44:28,258
But what?

1198
01:44:28,804 --> 01:44:30,886
Oh, my god.
“what is it?

1199
01:44:31,724 --> 01:44:34,807
The nubra river is at the base
of the siachen glacier.

1200
01:44:35,144 --> 01:44:36,704
So a nuclear blast there
would irradiate

1201
01:44:36,729 --> 01:44:39,812
the largest natural irrigation system
in the world.

1202
01:44:40,483 --> 01:44:44,146
Fresh water from the border of
China to India and Pakistan.

1203
01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:48,271
They're gonna starve one-third
of the world's population.

1204
01:44:48,449 --> 01:44:49,655
"The greater the suffering..."

1205
01:44:49,909 --> 01:44:51,900
"The greater the peace."

1206
01:44:52,453 --> 01:44:55,286
I still don't understand
why Lane wants a medical camp there.

1207
01:44:55,456 --> 01:44:56,616
It doesn't matter.

1208
01:44:56,791 --> 01:44:59,373
All that matters now is we find a way
to defuse those bombs.

1209
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:01,200
Uh, I think I've found it.

1210
01:45:01,545 --> 01:45:03,035
Maybe. Um...

1211
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:05,650
Look, there appears to be a flaw
in the bomb's operating system.

1212
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:07,961
The remote detonator
requires that firing key.

1213
01:45:08,135 --> 01:45:10,467
If we remove that key,
then it should short out

1214
01:45:10,554 --> 01:45:12,966
the fail-safe and allow us
to cut both fuses.

1215
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:14,659
So one of us needs to get the detonator

1216
01:45:14,683 --> 01:45:15,683
and remove that key.

1217
01:45:15,768 --> 01:45:16,803
Yeah.

1218
01:45:16,977 --> 01:45:19,719
While the rest of us cut the fuses
on both bombs. Simple.

1219
01:45:20,564 --> 01:45:21,849
Yeah, but...

1220
01:45:22,233 --> 01:45:23,564
But what?

1221
01:45:23,859 --> 01:45:26,020
Well, in order to make this work,

1222
01:45:26,111 --> 01:45:28,227
we can't remove the key
or cut the fuses

1223
01:45:28,405 --> 01:45:31,067
until after the countdown starts.

1224
01:45:31,659 --> 01:45:33,399
But Walt,
just so I've got this clear.

1225
01:45:33,577 --> 01:45:36,068
Our only chance
to safely defuse both bombs

1226
01:45:36,163 --> 01:45:38,028
1s to let the countdown start.

1227
01:45:38,999 --> 01:45:41,490
And then remove that key.

1228
01:45:49,593 --> 01:45:50,924
Okay.

1229
01:46:08,988 --> 01:46:12,321
Both devices are now
connected to the detonator.

1230
01:46:13,409 --> 01:46:15,365
Fifteen minutes should
give you enough time

1231
01:46:15,452 --> 01:46:17,534
to reach minimum safe distance.

1232
01:46:19,957 --> 01:46:22,118
My running days are over.

1233
01:46:23,043 --> 01:46:25,284
This is where it ends for me.

1234
01:46:53,949 --> 01:46:56,031
I'm getting signals all over the place.

1235
01:46:56,201 --> 01:46:59,568
We're at a medical camp.
X-ray machines, cat scanners,

1236
01:46:59,663 --> 01:47:01,063
radiological signatures everywhere.

1237
01:47:01,206 --> 01:47:02,696
It's like a needle in a haystack.

1238
01:47:02,791 --> 01:47:04,747
Process of elimination, one at a time.

1239
01:47:04,835 --> 01:47:06,621
Let's split up. Stay on comms.

1240
01:47:16,972 --> 01:47:18,007
Ethan?

1241
01:47:23,854 --> 01:47:24,934
Julia?

1242
01:47:29,818 --> 01:47:31,103
Is that...

1243
01:47:35,366 --> 01:47:36,446
Julia!

1244
01:47:38,369 --> 01:47:39,700
Does he know?

1245
01:47:40,871 --> 01:47:41,871
Hey.

1246
01:47:42,581 --> 01:47:44,663
Uh, this is my husband, Erik.

1247
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,080
Uh, this is...

1248
01:47:46,168 --> 01:47:47,829
rob. rob Thorne.
Dr. rob Thorne.

1249
01:47:48,587 --> 01:47:50,578
I worked with Julia...
At mass general.

1250
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:52,340
Before New York.

1251
01:47:52,424 --> 01:47:53,755
Oh, you're kidding.

1252
01:47:53,926 --> 01:47:55,666
What a coincidence!
I know. I...

1253
01:47:55,844 --> 01:47:57,675
What brings you all this way?
I was, uh...

1254
01:47:57,846 --> 01:47:59,757
I was in turtuk, not far from here

1255
01:48:00,015 --> 01:48:02,506
and heard help was needed.

1256
01:48:02,768 --> 01:48:03,768
Oh, well,

1257
01:48:03,936 --> 01:48:05,892
actually we're just about finished here.

1258
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:08,437
The whole village is inoculated.
But, uh...

1259
01:48:09,024 --> 01:48:10,764
What were you doing out in turtuk?

1260
01:48:11,443 --> 01:48:12,933
Rob's on vacation.

1261
01:48:13,112 --> 01:48:15,774
No. No, I'm... I'm working.

1262
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:19,819
You're a long way from home.

1263
01:48:20,077 --> 01:48:22,193
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks to our guardian angel.

1264
01:48:22,997 --> 01:48:23,997
Guardian?

1265
01:48:24,248 --> 01:48:25,892
Well, yeah. We were
running a field hospital

1266
01:48:25,916 --> 01:48:27,998
outside of Darfur when
the outbreak happened here.

1267
01:48:28,168 --> 01:48:29,270
And here comes this phone call

1268
01:48:29,294 --> 01:48:30,955
from an anonymous donor,
out of the blue.

1269
01:48:31,755 --> 01:48:33,233
And, uh, he says
he's ready to underwrite

1270
01:48:33,257 --> 01:48:35,748
the entire operation. One condition.

1271
01:48:36,218 --> 01:48:37,708
We run the whole thing.

1272
01:48:37,928 --> 01:48:39,759
Can you believe that?

1273
01:48:40,931 --> 01:48:42,421
I certainly can.

1274
01:48:42,850 --> 01:48:44,340
Yeah. Out of the blue.

1275
01:48:44,518 --> 01:48:45,928
Out of the blue.

1276
01:48:48,439 --> 01:48:49,929
That's quite a full life.

1277
01:48:50,107 --> 01:48:52,098
Yeah, you know, before Julia,
I never traveled.

1278
01:48:52,359 --> 01:48:54,020
I never even left New York.

1279
01:48:54,194 --> 01:48:55,809
Never left the hospital.

1280
01:48:55,904 --> 01:48:58,441
Seven days a week,
dusk till dawn. No vacations.

1281
01:48:58,615 --> 01:49:00,105
Ethan, I think I found something.

1282
01:49:02,244 --> 01:49:03,529
Heart attack at 55.

1283
01:49:03,704 --> 01:49:06,616
And she convinced me
to let it all go.

1284
01:49:07,291 --> 01:49:08,952
Help where it's needed most.

1285
01:49:09,126 --> 01:49:11,162
So we've been on the go ever since,

1286
01:49:11,462 --> 01:49:13,293
and I've never been more fulfilled.

1287
01:49:14,465 --> 01:49:16,126
I'm happy for you.

1288
01:49:17,217 --> 01:49:18,377
Thank you.

1289
01:49:20,387 --> 01:49:22,093
Well, we should get going.
Oh.

1290
01:49:22,181 --> 01:49:23,546
We have a lot of packing to do.

1291
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:25,722
Oh, no, I'll handle that.
You two should catch up.

1292
01:49:25,809 --> 01:49:27,470
Oh, no, I should
get out of your hair.

1293
01:49:27,644 --> 01:49:29,635
Are you kidding?
You should stick around.

1294
01:49:29,813 --> 01:49:32,020
I'm just sorry you came
all this way for nothing.

1295
01:49:32,816 --> 01:49:33,851
Um...

1296
01:49:34,276 --> 01:49:36,608
Tell you what, we'll pack,

1297
01:49:36,904 --> 01:49:38,815
and why don't we give you
a ride back to turtuk,

1298
01:49:38,906 --> 01:49:41,397
you two can catch up
in the car? Yeah?

1299
01:49:41,867 --> 01:49:43,357
You're very kind.

1300
01:49:44,286 --> 01:49:46,618
Settled. See you soon.

1301
01:49:48,165 --> 01:49:49,655
It was good to see you.

1302
01:49:50,959 --> 01:49:53,792
I am so sorry, Julia.
I'm so sorry.

1303
01:50:15,067 --> 01:50:16,978
Take both helicopters.

1304
01:50:18,153 --> 01:50:19,814
No one else leaves.

1305
01:50:27,913 --> 01:50:29,574
Careful, careful, careful.

1306
01:50:34,336 --> 01:50:35,336
It's armed.

1307
01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:36,900
But the countdown hasn't started yet.

1308
01:50:36,964 --> 01:50:38,733
The network signal's strong,
which means the other device

1309
01:50:38,757 --> 01:50:40,293
is close by and the detonator.

1310
01:50:40,467 --> 01:50:42,799
About half a k in that direction.

1311
01:50:44,012 --> 01:50:45,422
They're still here.

1312
01:50:46,890 --> 01:50:48,130
Luther, you keep working on it.

1313
01:50:48,183 --> 01:50:49,298
You two, come with me.

1314
01:50:50,936 --> 01:50:53,268
Oh, sure. I got this.

1315
01:50:53,689 --> 01:50:55,680
Don't worry about old Luther.

1316
01:51:29,725 --> 01:51:31,056
Walker.

1317
01:51:36,732 --> 01:51:37,732
Damn.

1318
01:51:37,941 --> 01:51:39,272
Ethan, the countdown has started!

1319
01:51:39,359 --> 01:51:40,439
We have 15 minufes.

1320
01:51:40,611 --> 01:51:42,272
Walker has the detonator.

1321
01:51:52,039 --> 01:51:53,154
Come on, come on!

1322
01:51:55,375 --> 01:51:56,785
We have to evacuate these people.

1323
01:51:56,877 --> 01:51:57,877
There's no time.

1324
01:51:58,045 --> 01:52:00,286
This whole valley's gonna be
incinerated in 15 minutes.

1325
01:52:04,301 --> 01:52:05,416
It's too late!

1326
01:52:05,677 --> 01:52:06,712
No.

1327
01:52:07,012 --> 01:52:08,297
I'm gonna get the detonator.

1328
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:10,511
What? How?
I'll figure it out.

1329
01:52:11,558 --> 01:52:13,549
Find Lane!
Find the other bomb!

1330
01:52:14,811 --> 01:52:17,171
[ What the hell is he doing?
] Find it best not to look.

1331
01:52:52,724 --> 01:52:53,804
How we doing, Luther?

1332
01:52:54,017 --> 01:52:55,870
Tripwires everywhere.
I don't have enough hands.

1333
01:52:55,894 --> 01:52:57,009
Just make it happen.

1334
01:52:57,187 --> 01:52:58,222
Where's Ethan?

1335
01:52:58,313 --> 01:52:59,849
He's gone after the detonator.

1336
01:53:00,023 --> 01:53:01,354
Wait, where's the detonator?

1337
01:53:39,313 --> 01:53:40,519
Luther.

1338
01:53:41,231 --> 01:53:43,267
Julia. You shouldn't be here.

1339
01:53:43,442 --> 01:53:44,522
Oh, my god.

1340
01:53:45,193 --> 01:53:46,433
Oh, my god.

1341
01:53:46,862 --> 01:53:47,982
Is that what I think it 187?

1342
01:53:48,071 --> 01:53:49,607
Luther, get her out of there!

1343
01:53:49,948 --> 01:53:51,609
Where is she gonna go?

1344
01:53:53,285 --> 01:53:54,616
What can I do?

1345
01:53:56,788 --> 01:53:58,779
In the kit,
the pliers with the red grip.

1346
01:53:58,957 --> 01:54:01,494
Are you insane?
Mind your business, Benji.

1347
01:54:01,668 --> 01:54:03,408
This is my business!

1348
01:55:45,981 --> 01:55:47,471
Benji, do you copy?

1349
01:55:47,649 --> 01:55:49,389
Ethan! Ethan, where are you?

1350
01:55:49,734 --> 01:55:51,087
I'm in a helicopter going after Walker.

1351
01:55:51,111 --> 01:55:52,146
Hold on.

1352
01:55:52,612 --> 01:55:53,923
How did you get in the helicopter?

1353
01:55:53,947 --> 01:55:55,187
What, you can fly a helicopter?

1354
01:55:55,407 --> 01:55:56,647
Did you say helicopter?

1355
01:55:56,741 --> 01:55:58,902
What the hell are you doing
in a helicopter?

1356
01:55:59,077 --> 01:56:01,659
Just... hey, hey...
Did you find the other bomb?

1357
01:56:01,830 --> 01:56:03,536
We're still looking,
but finding the bomb

1358
01:56:03,623 --> 01:56:05,543
is not gonna matter
unless we have the detonator.

1359
01:56:05,584 --> 01:56:07,449
I know. I know.
I'll get it. I'll get it!

1360
01:56:07,836 --> 01:56:09,827
Uh, if he's in
another helicopter,

1361
01:56:10,505 --> 01:56:12,666
how are you gonna get it?
I'll figure it out.

1362
01:56:12,924 --> 01:56:14,585
You find the bomb,
I'll get the detonator.

1363
01:56:14,676 --> 01:56:16,007
I won't let you down.

1364
01:56:17,304 --> 01:56:18,635
I won't let you down.

1365
01:56:19,097 --> 01:56:21,509
Be ready.
Look, Ethan. Ethan!

1366
01:56:21,850 --> 01:56:23,761
Ethan, come in!

1367
01:56:24,144 --> 01:56:26,305
Benji? Benji? Luther?

1368
01:56:27,272 --> 01:56:28,603
Anybody?

1369
01:56:30,066 --> 01:56:31,397
I can do this. I can do this.

1370
01:56:32,027 --> 01:56:33,107
What do we got here?

1371
01:56:33,195 --> 01:56:34,275
We've got airspeed.

1372
01:56:35,113 --> 01:56:36,444
Airspeed.

1373
01:56:36,948 --> 01:56:38,779
Okay, power. This is power.

1374
01:56:45,457 --> 01:56:48,369
Payload. How do I get rid
of this payload?

1375
01:56:56,718 --> 01:56:58,128
Power.

1376
01:57:12,484 --> 01:57:13,724
Wire strippers.

1377
01:57:13,902 --> 01:57:15,438
I'm a doctor, not an electrician.

1378
01:57:15,529 --> 01:57:17,065
Sorry, the thing
with the green grip.

1379
01:57:17,614 --> 01:57:19,275
Got it.
The wire in my left hand.

1380
01:57:19,658 --> 01:57:21,489
The black one?
My left hand.

1381
01:57:21,660 --> 01:57:23,992
That's your left hand.
Sorry, the other wire.

1382
01:57:24,162 --> 01:57:25,197
The red one?

1383
01:57:25,288 --> 01:57:26,599
Yes, the red one in my right hand.

1384
01:57:26,623 --> 01:57:27,783
Just checking.

1385
01:57:28,041 --> 01:57:29,531
Oh, I like her.

1386
01:57:42,681 --> 01:57:44,012
Hold this for me, will you?

1387
01:57:46,768 --> 01:57:47,768
Holy shit!

1388
01:57:52,691 --> 01:57:53,691
Damn it!

1389
01:57:55,026 --> 01:57:56,436
Get up there!

1390
01:58:04,786 --> 01:58:06,117
That's right,

1391
01:58:06,538 --> 01:58:07,538
prick.

1392
01:58:16,339 --> 01:58:17,624
Oh, shit!

1393
01:58:24,514 --> 01:58:25,514
Son of a bitch.

1394
01:58:28,602 --> 01:58:29,602
All right.

1395
01:58:32,147 --> 01:58:33,182
Whoa!

1396
01:58:38,403 --> 01:58:39,768
Whoa, whoa, too much. Too much.

1397
01:58:40,697 --> 01:58:42,028
Oh, shit!

1398
01:58:42,741 --> 01:58:44,481
Pull up. Pull up.

1399
01:58:44,993 --> 01:58:48,906
Terrain. Terrain. Pull up.

1400
01:58:49,164 --> 01:58:51,075
Pull up.
I'm trying, I'm trying!

1401
01:58:51,249 --> 01:58:53,080
Terrain. Terrain.

1402
01:59:10,935 --> 01:59:12,300
Benji, I'm not finding anything.

1403
01:59:12,395 --> 01:59:14,101
I think we're looking
in the wrong place.

1404
01:59:14,439 --> 01:59:15,724
Signatures everywhere.

1405
01:59:15,815 --> 01:59:17,251
This is the perfect place to hide it.

1406
01:59:17,275 --> 01:59:20,267
That's the point. I know Lane.
If we're looking here,

1407
01:59:21,279 --> 01:59:23,270
it's because he wants us to.

1408
01:59:25,742 --> 01:59:27,073
I'm heading to the village.

1409
01:59:27,243 --> 01:59:28,983
Just wait for me, all right?

1410
01:59:31,373 --> 01:59:34,115
Uh... Lisa, I think
I've found something.

1411
01:59:38,296 --> 01:59:40,628
Cut this wire right here.

1412
01:59:41,883 --> 01:59:45,091
Turn that screw counterclockwise,
very slowly.

1413
01:59:45,178 --> 01:59:46,178
Got it.

1414
01:59:48,890 --> 01:59:49,970
So...

1415
01:59:51,976 --> 01:59:53,307
How is he?

1416
01:59:53,478 --> 01:59:55,935
Oh, you know. Same old Ethan.

1417
02:00:05,198 --> 02:00:06,198
Jesus!

1418
02:00:10,286 --> 02:00:11,651
Oh, shit!

1419
02:00:11,913 --> 02:00:13,449
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1420
02:00:21,881 --> 02:00:24,463
Benji, I see Lane.
“what? Where?

1421
02:00:24,634 --> 02:00:26,314
He's in a house
at the edge of the village.

1422
02:00:26,344 --> 02:00:27,959
All right, just wait for me, okay?

1423
02:00:28,304 --> 02:00:29,635
Lisa, wait for me!

1424
02:00:39,858 --> 02:00:41,098
No.

1425
02:00:45,739 --> 02:00:47,229
Nuclear bomb.

1426
02:00:58,418 --> 02:00:59,418
Damn it!

1427
02:01:42,754 --> 02:01:44,585
Benji, I found the other bomb.

1428
02:01:45,215 --> 02:01:46,455
Lisa, where are you?

1429
02:01:46,633 --> 02:01:47,918
I'm in a house...

1430
02:02:10,615 --> 02:02:12,776
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

1431
02:02:13,117 --> 02:02:14,698
You're out of your mind!

1432
02:02:14,786 --> 02:02:16,367
I don't know what's down there.

1433
02:02:20,667 --> 02:02:22,282
Pull up, pull up!

1434
02:02:31,803 --> 02:02:34,135
This crazy son of a bitch
is trying to ram us!

1435
02:02:34,305 --> 02:02:35,636
Gol

1436
02:02:52,824 --> 02:02:53,824
shit!

1437
02:02:54,325 --> 02:02:55,656
Benji, come in.

1438
02:02:55,827 --> 02:02:56,987
We're almost at the fuse.

1439
02:03:00,373 --> 02:03:02,364
Did you just say "other bomb"?

1440
02:03:02,542 --> 02:03:05,124
Benji, do you read me?
I'm working on it!

1441
02:03:05,461 --> 02:03:07,042
Lisa, where are you?

1442
02:03:25,189 --> 02:03:27,020
You can't stop it.

1443
02:03:27,483 --> 02:03:30,350
Do you understand?
There's nothing he can do.

1444
02:03:30,695 --> 02:03:31,901
When the clock runs out,

1445
02:03:31,988 --> 02:03:33,728
Ethan hunt will lose everything

1446
02:03:34,908 --> 02:03:36,318
and everyone

1447
02:03:37,493 --> 02:03:39,324
he ever cared about.

1448
02:03:40,622 --> 02:03:41,987
Lisa!

1449
02:03:42,081 --> 02:03:43,081
Benji!

1450
02:03:43,207 --> 02:03:44,287
Benji!

1451
02:03:44,375 --> 02:03:46,115
Lisa, where are you?

1452
02:03:47,462 --> 02:03:49,123
You don't want to see this.

1453
02:03:50,882 --> 02:03:52,042
Benji!

1454
02:03:52,216 --> 02:03:53,956
Ilsa!
Benji!

1455
02:03:54,552 --> 02:03:56,258
Benji! Benji, stop!

1456
02:04:25,583 --> 02:04:26,698
Benji!

1457
02:04:53,653 --> 02:04:55,143
Oh, no, no, no!

1458
02:05:33,651 --> 02:05:34,982
Stay with me. Stay with me.

1459
02:05:38,448 --> 02:05:39,675
No, no.
Not when I'm this close.

1460
02:05:39,699 --> 02:05:41,564
Not when I'm this close.
Come on, come on!

1461
02:07:28,099 --> 02:07:29,099
Thank you.

1462
02:07:29,392 --> 02:07:30,723
Tie him up.

1463
02:08:34,165 --> 02:08:36,281
Why won't you just die?

1464
02:08:58,606 --> 02:09:00,597
There's nothing else you can do.

1465
02:09:02,276 --> 02:09:04,187
Go be with your husband.

1466
02:09:05,446 --> 02:09:06,777
Luther...

1467
02:09:07,281 --> 02:09:08,361
Go.

1468
02:09:21,629 --> 02:09:22,629
Benji, where are you?

1469
02:09:23,214 --> 02:09:25,054
Okay, Luther, we're inside.
Tell us what to do.

1470
02:09:25,132 --> 02:09:27,544
You should see the red wire
attached to the motherboard.

1471
02:09:27,635 --> 02:09:28,635
Yeah.

1472
02:09:28,719 --> 02:09:29,947
You need to cut that
and the green wire

1473
02:09:29,971 --> 02:09:31,962
next to it simultaneously.

1474
02:09:32,306 --> 02:09:33,637
Okay, ready?
Mmm-hmm.

1475
02:09:33,808 --> 02:09:34,808
Set?
Mmm-hmm.

1476
02:09:34,892 --> 02:09:36,974
Cut.

1477
02:09:37,311 --> 02:09:39,643
I told you. It can't be stopped.

1478
02:09:39,981 --> 02:09:41,972
There's nothing you can do.

1479
02:13:00,055 --> 02:13:03,138
Benji, listen. Turn the screw
counterclockwise.

1480
02:13:03,309 --> 02:13:04,309
Yep.

1481
02:13:05,436 --> 02:13:06,972
Remove that panel and you'll see

1482
02:13:07,062 --> 02:13:08,927
the power and ground wires
for the fuse.

1483
02:13:09,023 --> 02:13:10,023
Got it.

1484
02:13:10,191 --> 02:13:11,977
When the time comes,
cut the green wire.

1485
02:13:12,067 --> 02:13:13,682
Do not cut it yet.

1486
02:13:13,861 --> 02:13:14,896
Okay. We copy.

1487
02:13:20,409 --> 02:13:22,821
Ethan, if you can hear me,
we're ready to make the cut.

1488
02:13:23,704 --> 02:13:25,160
Ethan, come in.

1489
02:13:25,456 --> 02:13:28,038
Benji, how do we know
if he's got the key?

1490
02:13:28,501 --> 02:13:29,957
He'll get it.

1491
02:13:30,127 --> 02:13:32,539
Yeah, but how do we know?
He'll get it done!

1492
02:13:38,427 --> 02:13:40,509
We're out of time.
We just have to hope he has it.

1493
02:13:40,679 --> 02:13:42,670
Okay, we're ready.
“at two seconds we cut.

1494
02:13:42,848 --> 02:13:44,368
Wait, wait, wait! Why two?
Why not one?

1495
02:13:44,517 --> 02:13:45,717
You want to cut it that close?

1496
02:13:45,768 --> 02:13:47,078
It's a second we'll never get back.

1497
02:13:47,102 --> 02:13:48,205
Can we make a decision on this?

1498
02:13:48,229 --> 02:13:49,664
All right, all right!
We'll do it on one.

1499
02:13:49,688 --> 02:13:50,688
Cutting on one?

1500
02:13:50,773 --> 02:13:51,973
Yes, one. All right, stand by.

1501
02:13:54,151 --> 02:13:55,151
Three...

1502
02:13:55,736 --> 02:13:57,647
Two...
One.

1503
02:13:57,863 --> 02:13:59,103
Now!

1504
02:14:37,152 --> 02:14:38,813
Okay.

1505
02:14:49,582 --> 02:14:50,992
My man.

1506
02:15:37,963 --> 02:15:39,294
Ethan?

1507
02:15:41,634 --> 02:15:42,794
Ethan?

1508
02:15:43,844 --> 02:15:45,380
Can you hear me?

1509
02:15:49,224 --> 02:15:50,714
Can you hear me?

1510
02:15:54,396 --> 02:15:56,136
No. Don't, don't, don't.

1511
02:15:57,066 --> 02:15:58,397
Don't try to move.

1512
02:15:58,817 --> 02:16:01,103
Don't move.
You're pretty banged up.

1513
02:16:04,073 --> 02:16:05,904
You're a lucky man.

1514
02:16:05,991 --> 02:16:08,403
It's a miracle that crash
didn't kill you, Dr. Thorne.

1515
02:16:08,744 --> 02:16:10,388
If your friend didn't find you
an hour later,

1516
02:16:10,412 --> 02:16:11,612
you would've died of exposure.

1517
02:16:12,039 --> 02:16:13,904
My friends?
Yeah.

1518
02:16:16,502 --> 02:16:18,493
She got here
not long after you left.

1519
02:16:19,254 --> 02:16:21,666
Right in front of half
the Indian army.

1520
02:16:22,174 --> 02:16:24,665
Can you give us
a few minutes, please?

1521
02:16:26,595 --> 02:16:28,677
See you later, doc.

1522
02:16:35,104 --> 02:16:36,435
Julia...

1523
02:16:37,773 --> 02:16:38,853
I'm sorry.

1524
02:16:39,692 --> 02:16:41,353
There's no reason to be sorry.

1525
02:16:41,443 --> 02:16:42,443
No.

1526
02:16:42,695 --> 02:16:44,356
I'm sorry

1527
02:16:45,614 --> 02:16:47,605
for everything. I...

1528
02:16:49,201 --> 02:16:50,532
Look at me.

1529
02:16:51,453 --> 02:16:52,784
Look at me.

1530
02:16:53,247 --> 02:16:54,908
Look at my life.

1531
02:16:56,583 --> 02:17:00,075
I love what I do,
and I never would have

1532
02:17:00,170 --> 02:17:01,580
found this if I hadn't met you.

1533
02:17:02,756 --> 02:17:05,088
And everything that happened,

1534
02:17:05,843 --> 02:17:08,676
it taught me who I am.
It showed me

1535
02:17:08,887 --> 02:17:11,469
what I am capable of, and I...

1536
02:17:12,141 --> 02:17:13,927
I am a survivor.

1537
02:17:14,476 --> 02:17:16,137
But what happened here,

1538
02:17:17,521 --> 02:17:19,352
it was my...
Nothing happened.

1539
02:17:19,523 --> 02:17:21,514
Because you were here.

1540
02:17:23,610 --> 02:17:26,943
And I sleep soundly at night
knowing you always will be.

1541
02:17:36,248 --> 02:17:37,579
You're happy?

1542
02:17:37,833 --> 02:17:39,073
Very.

1543
02:17:42,254 --> 02:17:44,666
I'm exactly where I should be.

1544
02:17:47,009 --> 02:17:48,670
And so are you.

1545
02:18:27,800 --> 02:18:29,256
Per your request,

1546
02:18:30,886 --> 02:18:34,799
I'm handing Solomon Lane
back to MI6.

1547
02:18:38,685 --> 02:18:41,176
Through a broker, of course.

1548
02:18:43,357 --> 02:18:46,349
Part of our ongoing arrangement.

1549
02:18:51,281 --> 02:18:53,522
After what happened in Paris,

1550
02:18:54,034 --> 02:18:56,696
we prefer to keep a low profile.

1551
02:18:58,705 --> 02:19:03,165
And that closes your friend's account
with British intelligence.

1552
02:19:05,212 --> 02:19:07,373
The ribs. Watch the ribs.

1553
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:11,332
I understand now
why hunley believed in you.

1554
02:19:12,010 --> 02:19:14,342
The world needs the imf.

1555
02:19:15,013 --> 02:19:17,174
We need people like you

1556
02:19:17,516 --> 02:19:19,006
who care about the one life

1557
02:19:20,269 --> 02:19:23,181
as much as they care about
the millions.

1558
02:19:24,940 --> 02:19:26,271
That way

1559
02:19:26,525 --> 02:19:28,186
I hever have fo.

1560
02:19:29,027 --> 02:19:30,267
You okay?

1561
02:19:31,446 --> 02:19:33,027
You've never looked better.

1562
02:19:33,115 --> 02:19:35,356
Don't. Please.

1563
02:19:36,285 --> 02:19:37,570
How close were we?

1564
02:19:40,455 --> 02:19:41,455
The usual.

1565
02:19:45,919 --> 02:19:47,830
The usual?

1566
02:19:49,214 --> 02:19:50,920
Please don't make me laugh.
