1
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,875
And this display is all that's left
of CONTROL, a secret spy agency...

2
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:30,743
...which once battled against
the criminal syndicate known as KAOS.

3
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,647
CONTROL was disbanded
at the end of the Cold War.

4
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:37,079
Okay, up next, an exhibit...

5
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:47,789
Judy, the elevator is still doing that thing
where it drops really fast.

6
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,622
Are you sure Maintenance fixed that?

7
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,127
Let me check.

8
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,060
Yep, they fixed it.

9
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,298
See you later.

10
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,135
- Hey, Max.
- Agent 50.

11
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,768
16 floors down,
how'd a fly even get in here?

12
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,309
- Hey, Max.
- Max!

13
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,810
Hey, Larabee, 91.

14
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:11,542
Yeah, big day. Could be
your last chance to push a pencil.

15
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,549
Field-agent test results are due.

16
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,816
Oh. Is that today?
I wasn't really thinking about it.

17
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,425
Can you imagine Max as an agent?
Little suit, little shoes.

18
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,384
Uh-oh. Two-nerd pile-up.

19
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,860
- Move!
- Ow!

20
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,797
Pretty boys. Nothing but empty suits.

21
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,995
- Good morning, Bruce, Lloyd.
- Why would you wanna be an agent?

22
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:36,938
I mean, lab guys like us, analysts like you,
we're the real soldiers.

23
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,476
We're the true guardians
of freedom and democracy.

24
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,114
And I hear we're getting
a new cappuccino machine.

25
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,715
No, that's only for agents.

26
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,443
Oh.

27
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,258
Hey, Agent 23 is back.

28
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,373
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

29
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,978
- Welcome back, 23.
- Maxie.

30
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,012
So how was the assassination?

31
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,980
Maxie, you know assassinations
are specifically prohibited...

32
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,017
...by executive order 12333.

33
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,155
23, you kill me.

34
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,556
- I could if I wanted to.
- Yes, you... Oh. Oh!

35
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,253
Did you see that face he made? Scary.

36
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,600
Six months' work. 18 million dollars.

37
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,905
Fricking agents, man.

38
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,405
Come on, let's see it.

39
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:47,376
A lot of chatter in this region
involves nuclear material.

40
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:51,074
You may remember
from page 627 of my last report...

41
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,048
...that there has been an uptick
in KAOS interest in nukes.

42
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:59,122
To wit, I offer
the following conversation.

43
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,453
What are you doing? Are you texting?

44
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:04,858
Yeah, letting my fiancée know
we won't be able to get married in June.

45
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,589
I'll still be in this meeting.

46
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,125
Can I see that a second?
- Yeah.

47
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,559
That's great.

48
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,963
That's weird. You lost your signal.

49
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,108
Sorry to interrupt, Maxie, go ahead.

50
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:18,872
Next time use your own damn phone.

51
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,306
Good morning, men. No, offense, Karen.

52
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,744
Snappy tie.

53
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,714
Sorry I'm late, but I just came out
of a budget meeting...

54
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,879
...with our incredibly abrasive, dismissive
and sarcastic vice president.

55
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,217
It's no problem.

56
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:37,386
I have obtained a snippet,
at great risk to a busboy in Balahd.

57
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,397
"Aftab, how is your coffee?"

58
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,237
"Good, Dalip, it's decaf.

59
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,371
How is yours?"

60
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,669
"It is good also.

61
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,377
How is your muffin?"

62
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,281
Powerful stuff.

63
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,118
So "muffin," then, is a code word?

64
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,948
No, it is comfort food...

65
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,989
...and quite frankly, more
fattening than most people realize.

66
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,558
Which begs the question...

67
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:11,891
...why would two
hardened KAOS agents...

68
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,862
...risk the carbs?

69
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:18,359
Because they are under
a great deal of stress.

70
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,199
- Hence the decaf.
- For Aftab, yes.

71
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,739
Dalip takes his full-strength. Why?

72
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,707
Because he has been sleeping
on the couch for three days...

73
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:29,170
...because he called his sister-in-law
a "leathery hag."

74
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:32,174
People often say things
in anger they don't really mean.

75
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:36,344
Leathery hag, fat cow, ungrateful whore.

76
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:41,391
Just words, really, that shouldn't
be used against you in a custody hearing.

77
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:45,125
Let it go, man. Those kids
don't even look like you.

78
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,225
Can we put a pin in this, please...

79
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,164
...and go back to Max's
extraordinarily detailed report?

80
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,099
Thank you, Chief. All I'm saying is...

81
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,138
...that until we understand
that our enemies are also human...

82
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,969
...we will never defeat them.

83
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:02,809
Yes, they are bad guys, but that
is what they do, not who they are.

84
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,878
Let's continue listening...

85
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:08,919
...and bear in mind that the next 100 pages
can get a little bit dry.

86
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,885
Come on...

87
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:25,460
Easy, Durat! This stuff is radioactive.

88
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,606
One slip-up, and it's "ka-fricking-boom!"

89
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:28,933
Shtarker.

90
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:34,178
This is KAOS.
We don't "ka-fricking-boom" here.

91
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,307
Sorry, Mr. Siegfried.

92
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,918
Get it in the truck,
and let's burn this place to the ground.

93
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,577
But if we have what we want,
why burn the building?

94
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:52,226
Any more questions?

95
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,448
Missed me!

96
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,886
All right! All right! I'm out!

97
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,053
He was lying, Max. It was a good shot.

98
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,528
Thanks.

99
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,395
I am so sick of training.
I wanna get out in the field.

100
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,335
Give it up, 23! It's just you
and Maxi-pad against the six of us.

101
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,737
Oh, gee, Maxi-pad,
I've never heard that one before!

102
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,144
I never have actually heard that before.

103
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,379
23, you're bleeding.

104
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:51,448
It's a knife wound from the last mission.
My blood gets pumping, it seeps.

105
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:52,989
Hey, Maxine!

106
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,889
Come over here
and we'll play a game I like to call:

107
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,927
"Let's Go to the Dog Show."

108
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,224
I put a collar on you
and make you my bi...!

109
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,273
I think I really got inside his head.

110
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,104
I am not proud of what I just did.

111
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,902
Game over, Chatty Cathy.

112
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,915
Game over when I say it's over.

113
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,875
- Okay.
- Wet willy.

114
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:24,383
Okay. Who wants lunch?

115
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:27,924
Well, excellent work, 23,
but I could've handled it my...

116
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,466
- Max, the Chief wants to see you.
- It is nice to see you too!

117
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,272
You wanted to see me, Chief?

118
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,910
Yes, Max, yes, please, sit down.

119
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,605
Your field-agent test results
just came in and...

120
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,679
- Something wrong with your ear?
- Absolutely not.

121
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,287
Would you like me
to wait while you answer that?

122
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:57,547
Answer what?

123
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:59,657
Nothing. You were saying?

124
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,225
I was saying the results
are quite extraordinary.

125
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:05,387
In fact, your essay on existentialism
was quite amazing.

126
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,088
I left that section blank.

127
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,063
Blank? Brilliant.

128
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,725
Brilliant, Max.

129
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:13,565
- You passed with flying colors.
- Yes!

130
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,230
You know what, sir?
I can't say that I am shocked.

131
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,139
I felt good about this year's test,
in light of the fact...

132
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:22,007
...that in previous years,
my fitness has been an issue.

133
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,546
Personal best.

134
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:33,624
But not anymore. I'm ready for duty.

135
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,920
I know how hard
you've prepared for this...

136
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,892
...and how much this means to you...

137
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,225
...but I'm afraid I can't promote you.

138
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,926
- What?
- I can't afford to give up my best analyst.

139
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:47,300
I mean, the amount of chatter
you get through, and the reports...

140
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,600
...I mean, they go way beyond
the raw data.

141
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:56,373
So to be clear, you're not promoting me,
because I do such a great job.

142
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,652
Max, the way you and I work
is becoming a lost art form.

143
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,618
I spend half my days
trying to convince the vice president...

144
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,587
...that intelligence comes
from humans and not satellites.

145
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,195
Men with hunches,
that's where the real work gets done.

146
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:12,296
I'm very proud of you, Max...

147
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,993
...very proud of you...

148
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,032
...but I need you where you are.

149
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,324
<i>I am sorry, but we can never be.</i>

150
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:47,523
Despite today's setback,
I will at some point become a field agent...

151
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,962
...and when that happens...

152
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:52,400
...one phone call could take me
to the other side of the world.

153
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:56,839
Who am I kidding? I'm a middle-aged
man who's missed the train.

154
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,139
You don't deserve this.
I don't deserve you.

155
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:03,781
You're so young and so full of life.

156
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:05,976
Don't do it, Fang.

157
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,149
Don't love me.

158
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:11,953
Here.

159
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,092
- Oh, great.
- Sorry.

160
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,728
That was my last mile.
I have no idea how fast it was.

161
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:19,228
You were moving.
It's not easy to knock me down.

162
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,628
I have a low center of gravity.
Pretty solid.

163
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,133
I'm just gonna call that one a 4:50.

164
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:28,296
Impressive. I once ran a 5:16.

165
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,341
Oh, really? That's, uh, slower.

166
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,000
Not everything's a competition.

167
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,008
Well, if it were, I'd win.

168
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,376
Ah. Are you flirting with me?

169
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,543
Not at all. Are you flirting with me?

170
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,482
That depends. Is it working?

171
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,853
Not at all.

172
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:47,492
Well, nice meeting you!
I admire your focus!

173
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:52,688
Am I invisible?

174
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,365
Bruce, Lloyd, what happened?

175
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,062
And what is that ungodly smell?

176
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,737
Fear.

177
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:38,773
I'll be back.

178
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,009
Freeze.

179
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:47,482
Freeze.

180
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,644
- No, you freeze.
- You freeze.

181
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,949
- I told you to freeze.
- Freeze times infinity.

182
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,421
Oh, my God.

183
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,625
- You.
- You.

184
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,591
- Are you CONTROL?
- I'm Maxwell Smart.

185
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,731
I am a CONTROL analyst. Who are you?

186
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,058
I'm Agent 99.

187
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,432
Oh, my word. You are Agent 99?

188
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,335
- I am a huge fan!
- Thank you.

189
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,614
What are you doing?

190
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,811
I'm right here, just talk to me!

191
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:26,423
I'm going to cause a diversion.
You run and get help.

192
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,560
- I really don't think that that's a...
- Shh.

193
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,661
- Did you just...?
- Shh!

194
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,041
Go, go, go!

195
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:51,573
Wait!

196
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,384
Somebody shut it off!

197
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,126
Good, 23, just in time.
I think I got one of them.

198
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,759
Is that the Chief?

199
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:12,830
Yes, it is.

200
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,233
Sorry about that, Chief.

201
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,831
Is that a dent in his head?

202
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,421
Hi. Hi.

203
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:38,427
Agent 13, you are in a tree.

204
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:41,862
Yeah, communications got knocked down,
so they put me in a tree.

205
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,025
- Old-school stuff.
- Glad to see you're okay.

206
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:45,227
Yeah, yeah.

207
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:49,104
Well, I have to get going.
Would you raise up the walkway, please?

208
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:51,572
You don't have to get going.
You don't have to go.

209
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:52,938
Yeah, I've got a meeting.

210
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,704
- How you been?
- I've been well.

211
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,610
- Everything good?
- It's great. Well, I gotta...

212
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,375
Could you come back this way?

213
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,247
Yeah, yeah, I think I will.

214
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:03,919
What time?

215
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,915
Well... Mm.

216
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,055
I get it.

217
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,153
Who wants to talk to a guy in a tree?

218
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,628
I get it.

219
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,531
Hang in there.
Don't cry, don't... Please don't cry.

220
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,650
Okay. Let's get started.

221
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:43,488
You'll have to bear with me,
I'm still a little fuzzy.

222
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:46,130
I got a pretty good
hit in the head yesterday.

223
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:50,291
Yes, it was dark in there.
You probably tripped.

224
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:53,529
I hurt my knee. It was smoky too.

225
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,032
All right, here's what we know.

226
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,007
Wait. Chief, I request
the cone of silence.

227
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,910
Max, not the cone of silence.
We're in a safe room, for God's sakes.

228
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,675
We thought CONTROL was safe.

229
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:07,783
Okay. Lloyd.

230
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:15,557
Okay, we have reason to believe
that our security was breached by KAOS.

231
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,991
- You have to speak up.
- Can you hear me?

232
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,994
- I'm not hearing anyone.
- What?

233
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,099
Can you hear me?
- What did you say?

234
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,827
- Bruce, it's not working.
- It's not working!

235
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,903
Chief! I hit you in the head
with a fire extinguisher!

236
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:31,042
No, no, no, we're not ready yet.

237
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,144
Okay. All right.

238
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,576
- It doesn't work, get rid of it.
- Turn it off.

239
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:38,341
This thing is no good.
It's a useless piece of garbage.

240
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,678
- Turn it off!
- Larabee, you all right?

241
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,787
Larabee wants out!

242
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:50,324
Today's the day, and we're gonna
get rid of this damn thing.

243
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:53,090
That is cold. That's cold.
- All right, easy.

244
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,892
All right, are we done?

245
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,432
Yep. I can hear now.

246
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,696
Sorry, Chief, someone led me to believe
the cone was ready.

247
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,568
For the record, I never actually
used the word "ready."

248
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,301
"I'll show them the cone.
The cone's the shizzle."

249
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,876
- You said that to me.
- All right, shut up.

250
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:08,603
Listen up, people.

251
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,112
There's been a rash of thefts
of nuclear material...

252
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,717
...especially yellowcake,
over the last three months.

253
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:18,516
Now, based on Max's intel, we were
able to get Agent 38 inside KAOS.

254
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,885
We must've been close
to uncovering something...

255
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,890
...so KAOS hit us and they hit us hard.

256
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:24,852
They hacked our system...

257
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,730
...and learned the identities
of all our field agents.

258
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,959
Around the world
our people are under attack.

259
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:41,039
Our only lead is the maker of the bomb
KAOS used against us.

260
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,737
Vladimir Krs...

261
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,849
- It's pronounced "Krstic," sir.
- Yes...

262
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,583
Krstic.

263
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:53,421
Yes. He is a Bosnian national, and one
of KAOS' favorite munitions suppliers.

264
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,390
Unfortunately, we have no idea
where he is.

265
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,689
Actually, sir, we do. He is in Russia.

266
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,890
- How do you know that?
- It was on page 482 of my report.

267
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,863
Doesn't anybody read my reports?

268
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:10,563
All right, our mission is clear, people.
Find Krs...

269
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,334
- Krstic.
- Yes. Find him!

270
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,502
- Kris Kringle. Fish stick.
- Yes, Krs...

271
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,272
- Okay, I got it, I got it.
- Krstic.

272
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:20,043
Use him to get to KAOS,
then recover the stolen nuclear material...

273
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,653
...before they can do something
less than friendly...

274
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:26,780
...and maybe, if we're lucky,
we can apprehend the man behind it all...

275
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,051
...Siegfried.

276
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,128
Pictured here with his
number two man, Shtarker.

277
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:34,129
How are we gonna do that
when our agents are compromised?

278
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:37,166
Put me out there, Chief.
I'm not afraid to expose myself.

279
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,395
Do you ever think before you speak?

280
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,971
No, I just whip it out there.
It's what's best.

281
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,801
Fortunately, we have other options.

282
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:48,743
99 recently underwent massive plastic
surgery, so her new face is not known yet.

283
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,849
We also have a new agent, Agent 86.

284
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,279
Who's that, sir?

285
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,079
It's you, Max.

286
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,515
All right, Maxie.

287
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:00,815
You did it.

288
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,524
Lloyd, may I have the C.O.S. please?

289
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:10,528
I'm so happy!

290
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:14,798
I'm so happy!
This is the best day of my life!

291
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:20,478
Max, you didn't push
the button hard enough.

292
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,137
- So you could hear me?
- Yes.

293
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,315
- Right.
- Excuse me, Chief, just a thought.

294
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:30,421
- I'm not questioning your judgment...
- 99, I insist on complete honesty.

295
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,615
If you have something to say to me,
I wish you would just say it.

296
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,124
Max has no experience.
I don't want him as my partner.

297
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,696
Well, that is a sucker punch
to the gonads.

298
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,136
Hey, Max. We got you a lovely
parting gift for your first mission.

299
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,569
Oh, a pocketknife.

300
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,072
Not just a pocketknife, Swiss Army knife.

301
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,734
Comes with tweezers, pliers,
a tiny magnifying glass.

302
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:57,075
Fish scaler, a saw, a flamethrower,
chisel, a wire-crimping tool.

303
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,114
- What was that thing you said?
- Chisel?

304
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,047
Before that.
Did you say flamethrower?

305
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:02,550
- Yeah.
- Check it.

306
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,351
We also added a crossbow
that fires harpoons...

307
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:11,257
...connected to spider-silk nano-thread.
Has the strength of steel cable.

308
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,921
It's a time-consuming,
labor-intensive technology.

309
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,226
The spiders
have to be individually milked.

310
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,369
And they do not like it.

311
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:19,868
No, they don't.

312
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:22,006
Gentlemen, you're the best.

313
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,531
Thanks.

314
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,992
Ladies and gentlemen,
while you are in your seats...

315
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,356
...please keep your seatbelts fastened.

316
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:48,858
I feel really good about us as partners.

317
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,729
23 says that's important.

318
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,098
"Trust is a must." That's what 23 says.

319
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:55,296
Does he?

320
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:58,466
You and I share a bond, I think.

321
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:02,807
We both know what it feels like to look
in the mirror and not like what we see.

322
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,779
You with the surgery,
me with the weight loss.

323
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,042
I wanna show you something.

324
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,316
That was me.

325
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,392
Wow, impressive.

326
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,221
Congratulations.

327
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,886
Thank you.

328
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,435
This is me.

329
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,999
Wow.

330
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:29,072
Very impressive, 99.

331
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,335
You were truly hideous back then.

332
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,438
Since we are going
to be portraying husband and wife...

333
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,982
...maybe we should get our story set.

334
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:41,808
Okay, good idea.

335
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:48,182
We met at a marketing convention in Vegas.
Married a year later. No kids.

336
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,260
I like your parents, but you hate mine.

337
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,794
Do we want kids?

338
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:54,830
Well, you do,
but I'm concentrating on my career.

339
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,764
I don't know if that's fair.
I mean, I'm older than you are.

340
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,962
- Well, not by much.
- Really?

341
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,874
When they gave me a new face,
I had them...

342
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:08,804
...take a couple years off.

343
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,470
You know, why not?

344
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:16,015
Well, if that's the case, then you are
at an advanced age, and you should be...

345
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:17,985
Well, no. I was never...

346
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:22,354
I'm just saying that your eggs could dry up
and fall out of your uterus.

347
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:24,893
So time is of the essence.

348
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,966
- That's your opinion.
- No, that is a medical fact.

349
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,830
There is a lot of time
for me to make this decision.

350
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:34,403
I will not be rushed into it
by you or my mother.

351
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:37,007
- You don't have much time.
- Where is the drink cart?

352
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:42,702
Uh-oh.

353
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,644
- What?
- Six o'clock.

354
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:49,112
Don't turn around, don't turn around.
Use your peripherals.

355
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:54,889
Do you see him?

356
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,425
I'm just widening my eyes.
I'm not actually seeing anything more.

357
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:01,031
The big guy that might as well
be holding up a sign:

358
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,996
"I'm an assassin, here to kill you."

359
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,568
Okay, 99, you know what?
That is profiling.

360
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:10,367
Just because he is large doesn't
necessarily mean that he is a bad guy.

361
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,837
Oh. Wow.

362
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:18,107
That's a bad guy.
That's a really bad guy.

363
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,046
- You don't say.
- Did you see his face?

364
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:21,242
Yes.

365
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:24,786
His head looks like
one of the Easter Island heads.

366
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,016
You know what?
I'm doing the same thing.

367
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,061
That's profiling,
and I will have none of it.

368
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:36,064
Darn it, I have gum on my new shoes.

369
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,404
- He's trying to light his shoe.
- It's a shoe bomb!

370
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:44,837
- Get him!
- It's gum.

371
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,502
- He's got a gun!
- Not... Gum! Not... No! Gum!

372
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,274
Gum!

373
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:55,476
Federal marshal, you're under arrest.

374
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:59,055
Sir, I believe you just shattered
my coccyx.

375
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:03,088
<i>Folks, we may</i>
<i>be experiencing a little turbulence.</i>

376
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:05,821
<i>The "fasten seatbelt" sign</i>
<i>has been turned on.</i>

377
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:10,430
Well, you were no help whatsoever.

378
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:14,299
How could I help?
I'm just a woman with a dusty old uterus.

379
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:16,770
I never said dusty.

380
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,468
We're close to the drop site.
I'll go first.

381
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:22,670
- Gonna be all right with your cuffs?
- No cuffs can contain me.

382
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,473
Excuse me, violent sky marshal.

383
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,647
What do you want?

384
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,287
I have to squeeze the lemon.

385
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:31,945
Ugh.

386
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,823
You heard me.

387
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:36,187
Squeeze the lemon.

388
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:52,708
- Do you work out?
- Occasionally.

389
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:55,038
Yeah, I'm big on protein. Protein's great.

390
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,026
I gotta get it out. I gotta get that out!

391
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:15,899
That's in there, that's in there.

392
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,337
No time for pain.

393
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,206
Over the drop zone.

394
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,250
Ball sack!

395
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,357
Son of a hamster.

396
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:49,762
You all right in there?
- Yeah. Yes, I am.

397
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,195
Everything's fine.

398
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,428
Mother of pearl!

399
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,337
That burns!

400
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,845
Last chance.

401
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:11,116
<i>Airlock activated. Three, two, one.</i>

402
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,525
First package away.

403
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:27,037
Absolutely, I love cats.

404
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,229
- Really?
- Yeah.

405
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:35,879
Damn.

406
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,292
Second package away.

407
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,748
Oh, good, you heard me.

408
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:16,484
Third package away.

409
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,613
Third package?

410
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:26,990
99, Easter Island.

411
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:39,040
- I'll be right back!
- Where could you possibly be going?

412
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:07,266
Okay, never do that again!

413
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:09,463
Stop hanging on me!
- Never! Stop it!

414
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:19,477
Max, I can't reach my reserve!
Do something!

415
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,524
That would have definitely
worked on me.

416
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:34,063
Are you crazy?
If I can't pull my chute, you'll die too!

417
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,913
Aim for the haystack.
- Stop talking.

418
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,851
- Aim for the haystack, it's softer.
- Stop talking!

419
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,024
You missed it.

420
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:32,916
Okay, not to keep dwelling on this...

421
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:35,423
...but that was some kiss.

422
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:37,117
How did you know that would work?

423
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:39,957
Have you kissed other men
who plummeted to their deaths?

424
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:41,155
Okay, you know what?

425
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:45,735
So far, our entire partnership has consisted
of me getting you out of trouble.

426
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,168
Do you know why?
It is because you keep leading.

427
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,801
So here's how we stop that. I lead now.

428
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:53,102
I'm the one with experience.
You know nothing.

429
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:54,968
I beg to differ.

430
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:57,842
I looked up your field agent exam,
and I scored...

431
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:00,007
- My what?
- Your field agent exam.

432
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:01,947
I scored eight points higher than you.

433
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,212
This is not a classroom.

434
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:05,913
That's the difference between
an A plus and an A minus.

435
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,821
- You'll get us killed if you don't listen!
- A minus!

436
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,428
Okay, you're faced with an assassin.
What do you do?

437
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:17,034
- I take out my gun, and I would shoot...
- You don't have a gun.

438
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:18,964
- I did until you took it.
- Bang. You're dead.

439
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:20,365
- No, I'm not.
- Bang. You're dead.

440
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:21,800
- Stop shooting me.
- You are dead.

441
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:23,941
- I don't like it when you shoot me.
- Bang. Bang. Bang.

442
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,268
- Stop it.
- Bang. Bang.

443
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,606
Stop shooting me more.
You already said I was... Hey.

444
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,637
Throw out your manual.

445
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:34,216
Out here there are no grades,
there's only dead, and not dead.

446
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,347
You know, I am not completely
incompetent without a gun.

447
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:42,550
I am a master in the art of Hwa Rang Do.

448
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:48,024
- I was not ready.
- That's my point.

449
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,496
Yeah, you know what? That...

450
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,828
Hey, what was that?

451
00:32:56,908 --> 00:33:00,639
Max is halfway to Moscow. Don't tell me
you're still translating that Russian.

452
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,370
They talk fast, it's hard.

453
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:06,039
It takes like eight of these morons
to do what Max did.

454
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:08,412
I can't wait till we finish
the Hymie project.

455
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:10,611
All these stupid agents will be obsolete.

456
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,278
- Bye-bye.
- What's a Hymie?

457
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:15,551
Hybrid Mechanical Intelligence Entity.
Basically a robot.

458
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,661
It's a stolen KAOS technology.

459
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,229
Being reprogrammed. Top-secret.
Need-to-know.

460
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:22,093
And you don't need.

461
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,765
I'm a trained killer.
I can kill you with anything in this office.

462
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:28,906
You wanna die by Post-its?
Because I could make that happen.

463
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:30,768
And that's a slow death.

464
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:33,607
Larabee.
- Yeah.

465
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:35,507
- Were you the last one to use the copier?
- Yeah.

466
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,840
You left it jammed.

467
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,347
So? Why don't you...

468
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,014
...unjam it?

469
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:44,177
- Just open the door, read the instructions.
- This your stapler?

470
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,915
- Yeah, want me to show you how to use it?
- No.

471
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:49,683
Unjam that.

472
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,089
- 23.
- Yes.

473
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:53,787
- Can I have a moment, please?
- Sure.

474
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,626
Yes, Chief.

475
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,963
Let me tell you about a pattern
that's beginning to emerge.

476
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,332
As a former field agent,
I'm very much aware...

477
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:04,600
...of how difficult it is
to make the transition to office life.

478
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,300
He didn't unjam the copier.

479
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:09,742
We have rules here. If you don't
follow the rules, then what are we?

480
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:14,078
I'll tell you what we're not. We're not
people who jam staples into people's heads.

481
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:15,879
That's CIA crap.

482
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,249
All right, look, Chief, I'm your best guy.

483
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:21,915
I don't belong in an office making copies.
I should be out there with Max.

484
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:24,527
Look, 23, no more stapling today.

485
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:27,260
Just hold on.

486
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,663
So how do you know this place?

487
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,138
Well, as an analyst,
I like to keep my ears open.

488
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:39,708
It's amazing what you learn...

489
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:43,677
...listening to chatter.
In fact, Ladislas Krstic loves this place.

490
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:48,785
As do many KAOS agents.
Café Minsk-Pinsk in Smolensk.

491
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:51,148
It doesn't get any better than "thinsk."

492
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:54,491
You see what I just did?

493
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,287
I added an "insk" at the end,
made it sound Russian.

494
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,020
Should've smacked you harder.

495
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:00,528
Is that your default setting?

496
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:03,166
Do you just punch people
in the face willy-nilly?

497
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:05,302
"It's Tuesday,
I'll punch Max in the face."

498
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,166
"A box of kittens,
time to punch Max in the face."

499
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:10,671
"I'm having bread,
time to punch Max in the face."

500
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,366
You know, I love bread...

501
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,875
...and I know bread
has a few carbs, but...

502
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:17,105
...l've never really been afraid of carbs...

503
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:21,718
...because it seems like no matter
how many I eat, I stay "thinsk."

504
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,163
I'm sorry, are you talking to me?

505
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:41,066
No <i>sprechen Sie</i> Russian.

506
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:28,118
Boy, you know what? I will tell you,
I love your country.

507
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:31,585
No more Communism.
No rules of any kind, really.

508
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:35,419
I'm filling my suitcase with steroids
and art from ancient Mesopotamia.

509
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:39,222
Ran over an old woman yesterday.
Best vacation I've ever had.

510
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,925
Time to take my pill.

511
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,741
There was a guy in the bathroom
who's really hot.

512
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,903
Okay...

513
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:59,208
No, no, no. Radioactive hot.

514
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,648
Although he did have a certain
rugged quality that some find appealing.

515
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,788
How did you know he was radioactive?

516
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:08,648
My watch is a Geiger counter.
You don't have one of these? Huh.

517
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:12,062
Listen, I think he was part
of the nuclear theft in Chechnya.

518
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,424
We should follow him.

519
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:15,225
I gotta say, Max...

520
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,434
...you picked a good restaurant.

521
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,531
Of course.

522
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:58,774
Tripe soup.

523
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,037
- This must be Ladislas Krstic's house.
- What?

524
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:05,774
Tripe soup is his favorite dish.
It was in the mission dossier.

525
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,043
Let's just see what we're
up against, okay?

526
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,618
I didn't get to eat at the restaurant.

527
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,993
And if you skip a meal,
the next meal you overindulge.

528
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:24,225
- Well, let me. I've got nails.
- It's a recipe for...

529
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,501
You owe me $3.

530
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:32,536
More guards.
We'll have to figure out a way in.

531
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:39,473
Miniature blowgun.

532
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,845
You don't have one of these?

533
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:46,080
These darts are tipped with a tranquilizer
derived from the skin of a lizard...

534
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:48,384
...known as <i>los zapatos de la muerte.</i>

535
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:49,651
"The shoes of death."

536
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:51,858
Excuse me.

537
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:55,593
They're 40 yards out,
that's definitely the edge of my range.

538
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:59,429
I'm going to have to give this one
a little something extra.

539
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:16,676
Wow.

540
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,412
You look spectacular.

541
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:19,715
Thanks.

542
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,855
You don't look too bad yourself.

543
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:24,389
Is that a wig?

544
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:26,086
Yeah, it came with the dress.

545
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:30,791
- How did I get into these clothes?
- That's not important. Let's go.

546
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:35,368
Am I wearing boxers?

547
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:41,640
For future reference,
I usually prefer briefs...

548
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:44,246
...for their security and peace of mind.

549
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,747
Going free-bird is not exactly ideal.

550
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:48,745
I don't like it.

551
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:06,569
There must be 200 people here.

552
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,831
Finding Krstic will be like
finding a needle in a haystack.

553
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,011
I'd love to dance.

554
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:24,143
English? But you understand Russian?
Very impressive.

555
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:26,414
Shall we?

556
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,953
I hope your date doesn't mind.

557
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:31,026
Oh, he's not my date.

558
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:34,358
He's just a local horse groomer
I hired to drive me around.

559
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:38,525
It's a tragic story. He's quite deaf.
Really not bright.

560
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:43,031
I am going to dance now.

561
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:47,276
You go get yourself some punch.

562
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:49,945
Okay.

563
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:53,650
I don't even know
how much gets through.

564
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:04,016
Chief, I need your help.

565
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:05,526
You're on. Go ahead.

566
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:06,822
<i>We have found Krstic.</i>

567
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:09,557
<i>I searched his house.</i>
<i>I can't find his computer network.</i>

568
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,362
Get me an infrared satellite scan.

569
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:14,629
I have to get back to 99,
she is in grave danger.

570
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:19,808
Your house is so beautiful.

571
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,544
It must be difficult to go to work.

572
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:25,981
I don't have to go very far.

573
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:03,381
I don't think so.

574
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:05,279
I wasn't talking to you.

575
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,584
Me?

576
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,523
I don't know.

577
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,255
It'll be fun.

578
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:16,690
Trust me.

579
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:10,316
You are so light on your feet.

580
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:11,920
I recently lost 150 pounds.

581
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,053
So did I.

582
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:16,454
Isn't it great?
I have so much more energy now.

583
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:18,094
Me too.

584
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,023
- Thanks for jumping.
- No problem.

585
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:52,913
Thank you for the lovely dance.

586
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:16,543
Did you see anything
while I was dancing?

587
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:20,081
Just once, but I don't think you expected
him to lift you so high.

588
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:24,478
Anyway, I found out that the office
is in the guest house.

589
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:26,247
Really? How'd you do that?

590
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:29,085
Show him a little décolletage,
cleavage, bat your eyes?

591
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:31,250
I'm not judging, just detecting a pattern.

592
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:33,794
- Ready to work?
- I'm ready to work. You ready?

593
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:35,898
- Oh, my God.
- You're just having fun showing your:

594
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,672
Six guards.
We are going to need another way in.

595
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:49,005
Stand by, Max. Larabee, let's go. Move it.

596
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:51,573
- What'd you do?
- I can't find the right screen.

597
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,944
It was here a second ago,
then it went away.

598
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:56,780
- What did you hit?
- Don't yell at me. It's not helping!

599
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:58,421
If you don't find that screen...

600
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,524
...l'm gonna have you hunting
for land mines, with a hammer!

601
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:06,519
<i>Got it, Max. There is one other entrance.</i>

602
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:07,755
What kind of entrance?

603
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:10,832
The kind where you'll wanna
throw your shoes out afterwards.

604
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:15,495
Oh, great, rats.
It's not enough that there's poop.

605
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:20,609
You know what, I never saw James Bond
in rats or poop, let alone rats and poop.

606
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:24,379
Look, a rat riding on a piece of poop.

607
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:27,278
Stop it. It's just a storm drain.

608
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:32,988
Here it is.

609
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:47,997
Exploding dental floss.
You don't have this? Hm.

610
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:59,481
Three, two...

611
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,174
...one.

612
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:25,701
Right.

613
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:32,708
Come on.

614
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,232
Are you staring at my butt?

615
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:53,899
No, I am not.

616
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:56,403
I might have been before, but I am...

617
00:47:56,573 --> 00:47:59,303
Now I am again. All right, I'm stopping.

618
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:02,536
Pay attention to what I'm doing,
so that you can follow me exactly.

619
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:04,208
Yep.

620
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:26,899
Okay, Max. Little heads-up.

621
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,130
High-intensity lasers. Whatever
part of you does touch gets sliced.

622
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:33,470
One more reason
why boxers were a bad idea.

623
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,156
All right, so do I have to do it
exactly like that?

624
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:49,519
Just come on.

625
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,640
That's impressive. Wow.

626
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,640
Careful, this one's tricky.

627
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:11,280
Good.

628
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,472
Very good.

629
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:15,845
Okay, it's not that good.

630
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:36,733
Max. Max.

631
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,236
Stay calm.

632
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,839
Max, keep it together. Keep it together.

633
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,404
Max. Max.

634
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,576
Careful! No, no.

635
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:50,652
He's nibbling. That's not cheese!

636
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:53,684
Max, be quiet!

637
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,990
Okay, shall we?

638
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:43,929
Did I hear something?

639
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:47,377
Yes, there were some
tap dancers in the hallway.

640
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:52,807
Damn it. I can't get into their system.
Biometric security.

641
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:54,746
If you don't mind, 99...

642
00:50:59,956 --> 00:51:04,052
The old "steam sticks to everything
but the oil from the last thumb print" trick.

643
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,251
Here we go.

644
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:08,726
- Shipments of explosives.
- Your boyfriend is a very bad man.

645
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:12,062
- And a really good kisser.
- Ignoring that.

646
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:17,902
Look at that shipment of detonators.
It's a little odd.

647
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,975
Well, he is a bomb-maker.

648
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:23,340
No. What is odd is that it was shipped
to a bakery in Moscow.

649
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:26,073
These detonators can also be used
for nuclear bombs.

650
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,080
I think this is our connection to KAOS.

651
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:42,688
I set that up.

652
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:54,772
Let her go.

653
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:56,611
No.

654
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:04,109
I'm not totally incompetent
without a gun, you know.

655
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:29,971
Thanks for the help.

656
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:33,539
That's enough. Pity.

657
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:38,382
I'm about to shoot beautiful woman
and her retard stable boy.

658
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:39,612
And yet...

659
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,685
...I will sleep like baby.

660
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,190
- Not bad for a rookie.
- Not bad for an old lady.

661
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:03,038
Siegfried here.

662
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:05,340
<i>How could you possibly screw this up?</i>

663
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,005
Krstic was a fool.

664
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,913
- And they got lucky.
- <i>Who's that? Who's speaking?</i>

665
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:11,212
That's no one, sir.

666
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:14,186
<i>They're heading towards you.</i>
<i>Don't disappoint me again.</i>

667
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:15,847
Don't worry, sir. They won't get pa...

668
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:18,686
Why does he do that?

669
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,727
Don't look at me. I'm no one.

670
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:22,387
And don't you forget it.

671
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,929
Everyone here can be replaced.

672
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:26,762
I even have backup for you.

673
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:28,928
It's called a rhinoceros.

674
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:57,562
I think it's time to find new wheels.
Pull over.

675
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:05,973
I feel good about the mission so far,
don't you?

676
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:07,404
So far, sure.

677
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,477
I think we work very well together.

678
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:10,977
Like at the mansion.

679
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:15,277
The way I held that guy's hair
while you punched him in the throat.

680
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:17,317
That was nice.

681
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:19,012
Nice?

682
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:20,850
Yeah, well, good teamwork.

683
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:22,491
What are you doing?

684
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:25,184
I'm just saying that I think
we're very compatible.

685
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:28,798
I think that you are confusing adrenaline
with, I don't know...

686
00:54:28,965 --> 00:54:30,523
...some other kind of hormone.

687
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:33,100
- No. That's not...
- Know what, Max? Just stop it.

688
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:37,001
Let me give you a lesson
that I had to learn the hard way.

689
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:39,334
You can't trust anyone out here,
not even me.

690
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:42,205
I mean, you know,
I could be a double agent.

691
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:45,111
The break-in at CONTROL
was probably an inside job.

692
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:48,342
It happened just as I got back.
How do you know that it wasn't me?

693
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:51,879
- What are we talking about here?
- Let's just find a car.

694
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:54,717
Which one's gonna attract
the least attention?

695
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:58,820
All right, well, we have
a couple Soviet-era sedans here...

696
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:02,396
...we have that tractor, that cart...

697
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:05,394
...and... That'll work.

698
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:09,270
- No.
- Yes.

699
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:10,838
No.

700
00:55:11,174 --> 00:55:12,368
Yes.

701
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:19,004
- Oh, yeah, we are really under the radar.
- Will you relax?

702
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:22,049
Since the fall of Communism,
everybody has one of these here.

703
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:51,242
There's our little KAOS bakery.

704
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:54,542
I don't have to remind you,
but this isn't like the last place.

705
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:58,245
There's no party, there's no dancing.
Everyone in there is a trained killer.

706
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:00,286
Do you understand? Okay.

707
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:02,925
Did they explain to you
how your belt buckle works?

708
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:06,119
No, but the technology for holding
up pants hasn't changed much.

709
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:08,264
- Max.
- Hey, what?

710
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:11,530
This one has a compartment.
Inside there's a pill.

711
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:14,761
If captured, it would cause death
in nine seconds.

712
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:15,962
Great.

713
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:19,475
But how exactly do I get them to take it?

714
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:25,513
- Not much of a laugher, are you?
- Here. Put this on.

715
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:27,081
- On what?
- On your molar.

716
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:30,378
It's a tooth radio. It sends sound
up your jawbone, into your ear.

717
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:34,717
I can't hear anything outside your mouth,
so if you get in trouble, you have to say so.

718
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:35,880
Is it working?

719
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:41,227
- Is it working?
- Yes.

720
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,626
Good.

721
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:43,823
Okay.

722
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,696
Well, you know what to do.
Good luck in there.

723
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,531
You too.

724
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:18,530
Free <i>rugelach?</i>

725
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:21,465
No, thank you.
I am here for something else.

726
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:23,102
Bread?

727
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:27,209
- Something hot.
- We have rolls that just came out.

728
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:30,005
Even hotter. Much, much hotter.

729
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:32,507
I already have boyfriend.

730
00:57:33,316 --> 00:57:35,910
- All right...
- Although, I could make exception.

731
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:37,109
No, that's okay.

732
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:40,484
Sure? Flour sacks in back,
very comfortable.

733
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:44,149
I don't think we are on the same page.

734
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:48,453
I'm here because Ladislas Krstic sent me.

735
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:51,293
Ah. Take number.

736
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:54,671
But I'm the only one here.

737
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:01,002
Oh.

738
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:31,904
Who are you?

739
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:34,771
My name is Nudnik Shpilkes.
Who are you?

740
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:37,538
- I am Siegfried.
- Did you say Siegfried?

741
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:39,871
Max!

742
00:58:40,116 --> 00:58:41,140
Yes.

743
00:58:41,317 --> 00:58:43,217
I understand that you're
the man to see...

744
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:46,446
...if someone is interested in acquiring
items of a nuclear nature.

745
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:50,184
- How do I know you're not CONTROL?
- lf I were CONTROL, you'd already be dead.

746
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,294
If you were CONTROL, you'd be dead.

747
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:56,421
Well, neither of us is dead,
so I'm obviously not from CONTROL.

748
00:59:00,099 --> 00:59:02,090
That actually makes sense.

749
00:59:03,436 --> 00:59:06,496
Follow me, Mr. Shpilkes.

750
00:59:12,712 --> 00:59:14,737
Test. Test.

751
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:20,748
Ah. The "Ode to Joy"
from Beethoven's Ninth.

752
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:24,913
Stone deaf when he wrote it.
Syphilis. Fun stuff.

753
00:59:25,558 --> 00:59:30,086
Yes, a personal favorite.
A bit familiar, but it ends with a bang.

754
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:32,920
You're doing great, Max.

755
00:59:33,132 --> 00:59:37,159
What I'm about to show you is
the inner sanctum of our entire operation.

756
00:59:37,336 --> 00:59:39,861
The inner sanctum
of the entire operation?

757
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:44,801
Yes.

758
00:59:53,686 --> 00:59:55,153
This is it?

759
00:59:55,321 --> 00:59:56,754
Of course not. I lied.

760
00:59:56,923 --> 00:59:58,220
He does that.

761
00:59:58,391 --> 01:00:01,360
I'm going to kill you,
and then I'm going to kill your partner.

762
01:00:01,527 --> 01:00:03,290
I don't know who you're talking about.

763
01:00:08,501 --> 01:00:12,096
Ah. Mrs. Shpilkes must be lost.

764
01:00:12,271 --> 01:00:15,536
I think it's only fair to warn you,
this facility is surrounded...

765
01:00:15,708 --> 01:00:18,609
...by a highly trained team
of 130 Black Op snipers.

766
01:00:18,778 --> 01:00:20,746
- I don't believe you.
- Would you believe...

767
01:00:20,913 --> 01:00:22,904
...two dozen Delta Force commandos?

768
01:00:23,082 --> 01:00:25,607
- No.
- How about Chuck Norris with a BB gun?

769
01:00:26,185 --> 01:00:27,618
Goodbye, Mr. Smart.

770
01:00:30,289 --> 01:00:33,986
Well, Mr. Shtarker,
I think you've underestimated me...

771
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,151
...and the element of surpr...!

772
01:00:46,238 --> 01:00:48,968
99, we've been compromised. Get out.

773
01:01:08,861 --> 01:01:10,556
<i>Access denied.</i>

774
01:01:40,393 --> 01:01:42,918
<i>Access denied. Access denied.</i>

775
01:01:43,095 --> 01:01:45,563
<i>Access denied.</i>

776
01:01:58,611 --> 01:01:59,635
Max, where are you?

777
01:01:59,812 --> 01:02:02,042
99, I found the yellowcake.

778
01:02:02,214 --> 01:02:03,875
Of course you did, it's a bakery.

779
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:06,712
No, not yellow "cake" cake,
yellowcake uranium.

780
01:02:06,886 --> 01:02:11,380
Although there is yellow "cake" cake
here as well.

781
01:02:12,224 --> 01:02:13,486
Oh, Max.

782
01:02:40,301 --> 01:02:41,928
Max, do you read...?

783
01:02:42,103 --> 01:02:43,365
99!

784
01:02:43,538 --> 01:02:45,369
What happened to your radio?

785
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:48,532
I swallowed it. I can get it back,
but you may not want it.

786
01:02:48,709 --> 01:02:50,533
- Good Lord.
- Listen...

787
01:02:50,711 --> 01:02:53,242
...l've placed charges
at points all over the building.

788
01:02:54,635 --> 01:02:58,332
What? Max, you can't blow up a building
full of radioactive material!

789
01:02:58,506 --> 01:03:02,408
I know that, 99. I've placed only enough
charges to safely bury the weapons lab.

790
01:03:03,444 --> 01:03:04,638
Max, that's brilliant.

791
01:03:04,812 --> 01:03:08,612
Wow. That's maybe the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

792
01:03:37,011 --> 01:03:40,947
- I don't get it, I thought he was dead!
- I will say this, he is not a quitter.

793
01:03:57,431 --> 01:03:59,956
This is just ridiculous!

794
01:04:06,173 --> 01:04:07,197
99!

795
01:04:07,374 --> 01:04:08,500
Wake up, 99.

796
01:04:08,676 --> 01:04:10,837
Maybe you should kiss him again.

797
01:04:13,781 --> 01:04:17,080
Wait, I know that voice.
The chatter! Dalip.

798
01:04:24,859 --> 01:04:26,053
Ow! That was me!

799
01:04:29,964 --> 01:04:31,988
- Max?
- I'm... Yep, still fighting.

800
01:04:51,085 --> 01:04:55,545
Now, Dalip, I can prove that I know you.
Your favorite dish is chicken tikka!

801
01:04:56,323 --> 01:04:59,349
Like me, you enjoy
<i>American Top 40 with Ryan Seacrest.</i>

802
01:05:13,574 --> 01:05:15,304
Ow.

803
01:05:25,052 --> 01:05:28,215
Wait, wait, Dalip,
there's something else that I know.

804
01:05:28,389 --> 01:05:29,549
Max. Max.

805
01:05:29,723 --> 01:05:33,454
Your marriage is in trouble.
Your darling wife, Zeenat, is leaving you.

806
01:05:34,061 --> 01:05:36,256
But there is still hope.

807
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:37,897
Do you love her?

808
01:05:43,137 --> 01:05:46,971
- Wha...?
- Then show her. Go home for lunch.

809
01:05:47,141 --> 01:05:49,701
Take her with you the next time
you go to kill someone.

810
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:51,702
She just wants to be with you...

811
01:05:51,879 --> 01:05:54,143
...and that means
less time with her sister...

812
01:05:54,315 --> 01:05:57,011
...who we both know is undermining
your relationship.

813
01:05:57,851 --> 01:06:00,285
Kick the gun to me.

814
01:06:00,454 --> 01:06:02,012
99, please.

815
01:06:02,756 --> 01:06:04,314
Big people feel pain too.

816
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:17,801
What are you doing?

817
01:06:18,606 --> 01:06:21,006
Oh, no. Oh, no.

818
01:06:21,175 --> 01:06:22,802
Max!

819
01:06:25,179 --> 01:06:29,809
Okay. Okay. That's all right. That's okay.

820
01:06:31,919 --> 01:06:35,082
Her sister's such a bitch.

821
01:06:42,630 --> 01:06:44,928
- You all right?
- Yeah. That was amazing.

822
01:06:46,233 --> 01:06:47,598
Thank you.

823
01:06:49,703 --> 01:06:51,227
We gotta go.

824
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:00,804
99.

825
01:07:07,655 --> 01:07:10,351
- What was that?
- I cramped up.

826
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:14,350
Come on. Come here.

827
01:07:14,728 --> 01:07:16,389
Good idea.

828
01:07:16,563 --> 01:07:20,294
We will climb up with you,
and we'll all go... together.

829
01:07:30,277 --> 01:07:31,608
He left us here.

830
01:07:31,945 --> 01:07:33,572
What a douche.

831
01:07:51,298 --> 01:07:54,199
Missed it by that much.

832
01:07:58,005 --> 01:08:00,940
Well, that's convenient. Shoot them.

833
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:11,748
Whatever you do, 99, don't look down!

834
01:08:11,919 --> 01:08:15,548
I'm gonna try to get us over to that ledge!
We can do this, 99!

835
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:17,948
Max.

836
01:08:18,592 --> 01:08:19,616
Right.

837
01:08:24,465 --> 01:08:25,693
Thanks, Chief.

838
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:27,824
Okay, no problem.

839
01:08:28,001 --> 01:08:30,834
The Chief is thrilled.
He sent 23 out to observe the cleanup.

840
01:08:31,004 --> 01:08:32,028
Great.

841
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:37,506
Listen, is it possible that you could
answer a personal question?

842
01:08:37,678 --> 01:08:39,509
It's possible.

843
01:08:40,347 --> 01:08:42,440
Why did you change your looks?

844
01:08:43,584 --> 01:08:47,213
Oh. Um...
That's not really a personal question.

845
01:08:47,521 --> 01:08:51,013
Things from my non-work sphere
spilled into my work sphere.

846
01:08:51,191 --> 01:08:55,127
Facts became known, identities were
compromised, and I became a brunette.

847
01:08:55,295 --> 01:08:58,355
Wow. That is a great story...

848
01:08:58,532 --> 01:09:01,933
...in which you revealed
absolutely nothing about yourself.

849
01:09:07,374 --> 01:09:09,001
I blew a mission.

850
01:09:10,778 --> 01:09:15,442
I was involved with someone from work.
I lost focus. The mission blew up.

851
01:09:15,616 --> 01:09:20,076
I broke it off with that person,
but my identity had already been revealed.

852
01:09:20,254 --> 01:09:21,812
So I had two choices.

853
01:09:21,989 --> 01:09:24,685
I could either spend the rest of my life
behind a desk...

854
01:09:25,559 --> 01:09:27,527
...which would be like
eight hours a day...

855
01:09:27,694 --> 01:09:30,390
...of scraping a cheese grater
against my forehead.

856
01:09:30,564 --> 01:09:32,395
- Oh, you know.
- Yes.

857
01:09:32,566 --> 01:09:35,194
Or I could change my face,
so that's what I did.

858
01:09:38,038 --> 01:09:42,702
And it was painful,
but it needed to be done, and s...

859
01:09:47,147 --> 01:09:50,446
- I don't wanna talk about this anymore.
- Okay.

860
01:09:53,921 --> 01:09:56,185
I used to look like my mom.

861
01:10:01,562 --> 01:10:04,554
I used to look like
two of my moms put together.

862
01:10:42,803 --> 01:10:45,636
Sir, if I may ask...

863
01:10:45,806 --> 01:10:47,967
...how did you choose the target?

864
01:10:48,141 --> 01:10:50,507
- Why Los Angeles?
- Major city...

865
01:10:50,677 --> 01:10:52,542
...lots of media attention...

866
01:10:52,946 --> 01:10:54,607
...and the president will be there.

867
01:10:55,115 --> 01:10:58,380
Still, it's too bad
about all the dead movie stars.

868
01:10:58,552 --> 01:10:59,849
Yes.

869
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:04,389
What will we do without
their razor-sharp political advice?

870
01:11:08,896 --> 01:11:11,990
Oh, my God, have you eaten the crew?

871
01:11:12,499 --> 01:11:15,059
Oh, look, it understands.

872
01:11:15,235 --> 01:11:16,896
Get back to work.

873
01:11:33,153 --> 01:11:37,317
No, that's not possible.
No, no, no. Max said that...

874
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:40,920
No.

875
01:11:44,665 --> 01:11:46,599
That doesn't make any sense.

876
01:11:48,368 --> 01:11:51,303
Yellowcake uranium, warheads,
an entire production line.

877
01:11:51,471 --> 01:11:54,440
There's nothing here
but what used to be a bakery.

878
01:11:54,608 --> 01:11:57,168
There are no weapons?
No radioactivity of any kind?

879
01:11:57,344 --> 01:12:00,108
Nothing. I've swept the entire area,
and it's clean.

880
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:03,477
- But Max said that he s...
- Did you see the evidence yourself?

881
01:12:03,984 --> 01:12:05,315
No.

882
01:12:05,719 --> 01:12:08,517
No, every time he found something,
he was alone.

883
01:12:14,728 --> 01:12:16,525
What do you want me to do with Max?

884
01:12:16,697 --> 01:12:18,187
- Do with Max?
- Max?

885
01:12:20,801 --> 01:12:23,292
You were right when you said
I shouldn't trust you.

886
01:12:25,138 --> 01:12:26,332
Give me the phone.

887
01:12:30,644 --> 01:12:33,112
And who might this be? Siegfried?

888
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,440
<i>Hello, Max.</i>

889
01:12:34,614 --> 01:12:35,638
Chief?

890
01:12:38,085 --> 01:12:39,848
Knockout gas, 99?

891
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:43,387
Please. I have trained my body
to be impervious to...

892
01:12:43,557 --> 01:12:44,888
That's new stuff.

893
01:12:47,828 --> 01:12:49,352
Oh, Max.

894
01:12:56,770 --> 01:12:58,795
I'm very disappointed, Max.

895
01:12:58,972 --> 01:13:01,873
I thought you and I were supposedly
cut from the same cloth.

896
01:13:02,042 --> 01:13:04,237
How can you think
that I am a double agent?

897
01:13:04,411 --> 01:13:06,879
You lied about finding evidence
of radioactivity.

898
01:13:07,047 --> 01:13:09,345
Killed Krstic before
anybody could question him.

899
01:13:09,516 --> 01:13:12,713
There's a matter of your
stoving my head in with a fire extinguisher.

900
01:13:12,886 --> 01:13:17,187
I said I was sorry. You just didn't hear me,
because you were in a mini coma.

901
01:13:17,357 --> 01:13:19,052
You've made CONTROL a laughingstock.

902
01:13:19,226 --> 01:13:22,024
The vice president wants to shut us down,
you know.

903
01:13:24,798 --> 01:13:25,822
99.

904
01:13:26,533 --> 01:13:28,125
This whole week...

905
01:13:28,769 --> 01:13:30,031
...last night...

906
01:13:30,971 --> 01:13:32,165
...you know me.

907
01:13:32,339 --> 01:13:33,772
Apparently not.

908
01:13:34,574 --> 01:13:35,768
Oh, my God!

909
01:13:35,942 --> 01:13:38,035
You two? You and Max?

910
01:13:38,211 --> 01:13:40,907
You said we had to break up
because we work together.

911
01:13:41,081 --> 01:13:42,275
Oh, my God! You and 23?

912
01:13:42,883 --> 01:13:45,351
I am so sexually threatened right now.

913
01:13:50,824 --> 01:13:52,314
<i>You have reached...</i>

914
01:13:52,492 --> 01:13:54,357
<i>... the United States</i>
<i>Department of Homeland Security.</i>

915
01:13:54,528 --> 01:13:56,996
<i>For threats against</i>
<i>the continental United States, press 1.</i>

916
01:13:57,164 --> 01:13:59,928
<i>For threats against Hawaii, press 2.</i>
<i>For threats against Puerto Rico...</i>

917
01:14:01,601 --> 01:14:05,037
You know, you're the only human being
I know who snores when he's awake?

918
01:14:05,205 --> 01:14:06,832
<i>If you're calling from a rotary...</i>

919
01:14:07,007 --> 01:14:09,601
Okay, today's threat assessment.

920
01:14:09,776 --> 01:14:14,270
- There are 72 threats on the list. Mike?
- Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

921
01:14:14,448 --> 01:14:17,713
Okay, we have a deteriorating situation
in Venezuela.

922
01:14:17,884 --> 01:14:20,444
We have a deteriorating situation
in Afghanistan.

923
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:23,316
What about the deteriorating situation
in North Korea?

924
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:25,355
- I was getting to that.
- When? Next week?

925
01:14:25,525 --> 01:14:27,857
Yes, next Tuesday,
right after I kick your ass.

926
01:14:28,028 --> 01:14:32,260
Gentlemen, when we argue,
the terrorists win.

927
01:14:35,735 --> 01:14:38,499
Anyway, last night at a private dinner...

928
01:14:38,672 --> 01:14:42,369
...President Kim Jong-il
made a very odd threat to, and I quote:

929
01:14:42,542 --> 01:14:45,136
"Make a pudding from the bones
of Americans."

930
01:14:45,312 --> 01:14:47,143
That guy's insane.

931
01:14:47,314 --> 01:14:51,341
Doesn't he know bones are crunchy?
Who'd want a crunchy pudding?

932
01:14:53,386 --> 01:14:54,410
War room.

933
01:14:54,588 --> 01:14:58,581
Finally. My name is Siegfried,
and I represent KAOS.

934
01:14:58,758 --> 01:15:02,956
<i>Over the past few months, we have</i>
<i>assembled a stockpile of nuclear weapons...</i>

935
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:08,033
<i>... which we have distributed</i>
<i>to 20 unfriendly, unstable dictators.</i>

936
01:15:08,802 --> 01:15:12,067
For the moment, KAOS retains
the bomb activation codes...

937
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:16,141
...but we will release the codes
unless our demands are met.

938
01:15:16,309 --> 01:15:17,367
What are your demands?

939
01:15:17,544 --> 01:15:19,603
200 billion dollars by 3 p.m.

940
01:15:19,779 --> 01:15:22,304
200 billion dollars by 3 p. m?

941
01:15:22,482 --> 01:15:23,881
<i>You seem a bit slow.</i>

942
01:15:24,050 --> 01:15:27,247
- Is there someone else I can talk to?
- Good one.

943
01:15:27,821 --> 01:15:30,551
Look, Siegfried,
we don't negotiate with terrorists...

944
01:15:30,724 --> 01:15:33,056
...and you're obviously bluffing.
Take a hike.

945
01:15:33,226 --> 01:15:34,853
What? Are you kidding me?

946
01:15:35,028 --> 01:15:38,657
You spent the morning talking about
pudding, and you ignore a credible threat?

947
01:15:38,832 --> 01:15:41,300
Credible? Come on.
KAOS has been defunct for 20 years.

948
01:15:41,468 --> 01:15:43,993
With all due respect,
the CIA knows nothing about KAOS.

949
01:15:44,171 --> 01:15:46,605
CONTROL has to be in charge here.

950
01:15:46,773 --> 01:15:49,765
- Like when you bombed that bakery?
- Muffins of mass destruction.

951
01:15:51,645 --> 01:15:53,806
That's it!
I've been waiting for this since Nixon.

952
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:57,211
- Here we go.
- I got a new pacemaker, I can go all day!

953
01:15:57,384 --> 01:15:59,443
- Okay!
- Okay! Come on!

954
01:16:02,756 --> 01:16:05,350
It seems like they don't believe you.

955
01:16:05,926 --> 01:16:10,260
Which is why we've arranged
for a little demonstration.

956
01:16:58,245 --> 01:17:00,042
Chief, you wanted to see me?

957
01:17:00,213 --> 01:17:03,614
Yes. You and 23 are coming with me
to see the president.

958
01:17:03,783 --> 01:17:06,513
- Can't you call him?
- Vice president won't let me through.

959
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:09,753
I can't believe we have to go
all the way to Los Angeles.

960
01:17:09,923 --> 01:17:11,754
Why is the president never here?

961
01:17:11,925 --> 01:17:14,485
I'm sure whatever he's doing
is vital to the nation.

962
01:17:14,861 --> 01:17:16,726
"Good night, moon.

963
01:17:17,497 --> 01:17:20,432
Good night,
cow jumping over the moon."

964
01:17:21,434 --> 01:17:24,733
Actually, I think you would suck
as my teacher.

965
01:17:24,904 --> 01:17:27,395
Well, from wh...

966
01:17:28,341 --> 01:17:31,071
Hey, Smart. Happy birthday.

967
01:17:38,318 --> 01:17:40,081
I'm fat!

968
01:17:50,030 --> 01:17:51,463
Gentlemen.

969
01:17:53,733 --> 01:17:56,531
Oh. Good, the itchy kind.

970
01:17:56,703 --> 01:17:57,795
My favorite.

971
01:17:57,971 --> 01:17:59,768
Does this one also have smallpox?

972
01:18:02,942 --> 01:18:05,069
And that was a human tooth.

973
01:18:05,245 --> 01:18:08,942
<i>American Top 40.</i>
<i>- With Ryan Seacrest.</i>

974
01:18:09,115 --> 01:18:11,948
<i>Here's a sweet dedication</i>
<i>from a little lady named Dalip.</i>

975
01:18:12,118 --> 01:18:13,585
<i>It's to her boyfriend, Max.</i>

976
01:18:13,753 --> 01:18:18,281
<i>"Meet me in L.A.</i>
<i>Things will be very hot. Nuclear hot. "

977
01:18:18,458 --> 01:18:21,825
<i>I don't know, if I were Max,</i>
<i>I would get myself to L.A.</i>

978
01:18:31,638 --> 01:18:34,004
Hey! Dumb guards!

979
01:18:34,174 --> 01:18:38,406
Why don't you come in here so I can
make you my pretty little girlfriends.

980
01:18:38,578 --> 01:18:40,045
You'll have to shower for weeks!

981
01:18:42,282 --> 01:18:44,045
But you will never get the smell off...

982
01:18:44,217 --> 01:18:46,447
You two seem very angry.

983
01:18:48,188 --> 01:18:50,315
Thank you, sir, may I have another?

984
01:18:52,625 --> 01:18:54,216
I was kidding.

985
01:19:02,335 --> 01:19:05,930
9-4-3-6-8.

986
01:19:09,542 --> 01:19:12,477
9-4-3-6-8.

987
01:19:29,529 --> 01:19:31,292
Turn around slowly.

988
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:36,799
Guys, you have to believe me.
I am not a double agent.

989
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:39,461
- We never thought you were.
- Yeah, we love you, man.

990
01:19:39,639 --> 01:19:42,403
Then what's with the firearm
and the freak-show expressions?

991
01:19:42,575 --> 01:19:43,974
For the security cameras.

992
01:19:44,144 --> 01:19:47,409
If it looks like we let you go,
we'd totally get fired.

993
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:48,638
Got it.

994
01:19:51,284 --> 01:19:52,751
So where are the Chief and 99?

995
01:19:52,919 --> 01:19:54,887
They flew to L.A.
to talk to the president.

996
01:19:55,054 --> 01:19:57,454
I need to get out of here
before someone stops me.

997
01:19:57,624 --> 01:19:59,216
- Overpower us.
- Good idea.

998
01:19:59,392 --> 01:20:01,053
Bruce, I will smash you in the face.

999
01:20:01,227 --> 01:20:03,821
- Thank you.
- Lloyd, I'll simulate your disembowelment.

1000
01:20:03,997 --> 01:20:05,521
Ready? One...

1001
01:20:05,698 --> 01:20:08,098
Not yet! I haven't punched yet.
React when I punch.

1002
01:20:08,268 --> 01:20:09,633
- Oh, yeah.
- One...

1003
01:20:09,803 --> 01:20:11,566
...two, three.

1004
01:20:13,006 --> 01:20:14,633
- Wrong way.
- Okay, wait.

1005
01:20:14,808 --> 01:20:17,276
- Sometimes I faint.
- I'm not going to hit you.

1006
01:20:17,444 --> 01:20:21,039
No, but when I see blood, or when
I talk about blood, or think about blood...

1007
01:20:21,214 --> 01:20:23,876
There will be no blood.
Hang in there. Hang in, buddy.

1008
01:21:11,197 --> 01:21:12,858
What are you doing, dummkopf?

1009
01:21:13,032 --> 01:21:16,798
Running out in the middle of the road!
You could get hit by a car!

1010
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:19,795
Well, that was ironic.

1011
01:21:34,087 --> 01:21:35,577
Chief, I'm not buying it.

1012
01:21:35,755 --> 01:21:38,747
With all our satellites,
there's no way anybody could possibly...

1013
01:21:38,925 --> 01:21:41,189
...have nuclear bombs
that we wouldn't know about.

1014
01:21:41,361 --> 01:21:42,760
"Nuclear!"

1015
01:21:43,162 --> 01:21:44,720
- What's that?
- Sorry.

1016
01:21:44,898 --> 01:21:48,231
Mr. President, if I could just
please show you some data, you'd agree...

1017
01:21:48,401 --> 01:21:49,925
Well, just back up here a second.

1018
01:21:50,103 --> 01:21:52,094
First thing I'd like to know is...

1019
01:21:52,272 --> 01:21:54,433
...what did the vice president
say about this?

1020
01:21:54,607 --> 01:21:58,338
I'm afraid the vice president and I had
a less-than-cordial encounter yesterday.

1021
01:21:58,511 --> 01:22:00,274
- Less-than-cordial, you say?
- Yes, sir.

1022
01:22:00,446 --> 01:22:01,470
I'll say.

1023
01:22:02,849 --> 01:22:05,545
The chairman of joint chiefs
sent me this little movie.

1024
01:22:05,718 --> 01:22:07,379
Put it right here on my cell phone.

1025
01:22:07,554 --> 01:22:09,545
Let me share this with you.
This is my favorite part.

1026
01:22:09,722 --> 01:22:12,213
<i>I got a new pacemaker, I can go all day!</i>

1027
01:22:14,093 --> 01:22:15,287
Oh, Chief.

1028
01:22:15,461 --> 01:22:16,621
Very sweet tackle.

1029
01:22:16,796 --> 01:22:19,287
Look. Look at the surprise on his face.

1030
01:22:19,465 --> 01:22:21,797
I probably owe you an apology
for that, sir.

1031
01:22:21,968 --> 01:22:23,560
No. Please, just save your breath.

1032
01:22:23,736 --> 01:22:26,000
But I have to agree
with that son of a bitch.

1033
01:22:26,172 --> 01:22:28,504
We cannot respond to every threat.

1034
01:22:29,876 --> 01:22:31,309
Case closed.

1035
01:22:54,901 --> 01:22:55,925
Max?

1036
01:22:56,102 --> 01:22:57,228
<i>Hello, 99.</i>

1037
01:22:57,403 --> 01:22:59,234
Trace 99's call, now!

1038
01:22:59,405 --> 01:23:01,270
- Where are you?
- <i>That's not important.</i>

1039
01:23:01,441 --> 01:23:05,343
<i>What is important is that KAOS has planted</i>
<i>a bomb somewhere in Los Angeles.</i>

1040
01:23:05,511 --> 01:23:07,479
We got him. He's still in Washington.

1041
01:23:07,647 --> 01:23:10,912
<i>Listen, while I was in my cell,</i>
<i>I had some time to think.</i>

1042
01:23:13,052 --> 01:23:18,115
<i>I realized that even though I was accused</i>
<i>of something I didn't do, I was happy.</i>

1043
01:23:18,558 --> 01:23:23,427
<i>Because at least for a little while,</i>
<i>I got to live my dream of being an agent.</i>

1044
01:23:24,430 --> 01:23:26,193
<i>And I got to be with you.</i>

1045
01:23:26,366 --> 01:23:29,199
<i>I learned that you have</i>
<i>a mean right cross...</i>

1046
01:23:29,369 --> 01:23:32,566
<i>... you are almost as good</i>
<i>a dancer as me...</i>

1047
01:23:32,739 --> 01:23:35,970
- <i>... and you used to look like your mom.</i>
- Max.

1048
01:23:36,142 --> 01:23:39,475
<i>Please, 99. All I'm asking is for you</i>
<i>to look me in the eyes...</i>

1049
01:23:39,646 --> 01:23:42,240
<i>... and tell me that</i>
<i>you don't feel something too.</i>

1050
01:23:43,016 --> 01:23:44,176
Freeze!

1051
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:48,116
Oh, Max. How could I look in your eyes?

1052
01:23:49,489 --> 01:23:50,751
Just turn around.

1053
01:23:58,164 --> 01:24:00,155
Why are you talking into your shoe?

1054
01:24:00,333 --> 01:24:03,734
The old "call forwarding
from the shoe phone to the cell phone...

1055
01:24:03,903 --> 01:24:07,236
...so you don't know where I am,
then I appear on the roof behind you...

1056
01:24:07,407 --> 01:24:09,398
...and surprise everyone" trick.

1057
01:24:09,575 --> 01:24:11,440
- Don't move.
- What are you doing?

1058
01:24:11,611 --> 01:24:12,635
How did you get here?

1059
01:24:15,815 --> 01:24:17,908
Do you have another one of these?

1060
01:24:21,721 --> 01:24:22,745
It doesn't matter.

1061
01:24:22,922 --> 01:24:25,891
What matters is that there is a bomb,
and I'm here to find it.

1062
01:24:26,059 --> 01:24:28,220
- How do you know this?
- I'd rather not say.

1063
01:24:28,394 --> 01:24:30,385
Max, there are millions of lives at stake.

1064
01:24:30,563 --> 01:24:33,760
If you have credible information
from a reliable source...

1065
01:24:33,933 --> 01:24:36,128
...I wanna know it,
and I wanna know it now.

1066
01:24:37,203 --> 01:24:40,070
I heard it from America's sweetheart,
Ryan Seacrest.

1067
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:41,570
- Whoa.
- Come on.

1068
01:24:41,741 --> 01:24:43,333
It was a coded message.

1069
01:24:43,509 --> 01:24:46,876
Max, we're running out of time here.
What are you talking about?

1070
01:24:47,046 --> 01:24:50,880
I received a tip from a KAOS agent
who I befriended at the bakery.

1071
01:24:56,389 --> 01:24:58,152
I think we should trust him, Chief.

1072
01:24:58,324 --> 01:25:00,292
Absolutely, Chief.
I'm with 99 on that one.

1073
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:03,258
Every time I look at Max's puppy eyes,
I'm a goner.

1074
01:25:03,429 --> 01:25:07,229
Oh, my God. You've really never
had anyone break up with you, have you?

1075
01:25:08,801 --> 01:25:11,702
Chief, you said that you and I are alike.

1076
01:25:11,871 --> 01:25:14,237
That we are both old-fashioned men.

1077
01:25:14,907 --> 01:25:17,034
Well, I have an old-fashioned hunch.

1078
01:25:17,210 --> 01:25:21,772
I have a hunch that you have a hunch
that I am telling the truth.

1079
01:25:22,882 --> 01:25:23,974
Max...

1080
01:25:25,418 --> 01:25:28,649
Any double agent who escapes
from a high-security holding situation...

1081
01:25:28,821 --> 01:25:32,416
...only to fall into the arms of
the people that got him in the first place...

1082
01:25:32,592 --> 01:25:36,392
...is either an idiot or not a double agent,
and I don't think you're an idiot.

1083
01:25:37,163 --> 01:25:38,187
Thank you, Chief.

1084
01:25:38,831 --> 01:25:42,164
Now, we know that the president
is in town.

1085
01:25:42,335 --> 01:25:46,135
- But what exactly is he doing here today?
- Max.

1086
01:25:46,305 --> 01:25:50,605
- Yes. We need to find out his itinerary.
- But, Max, the...

1087
01:25:50,777 --> 01:25:53,507
I know, 99. I need to go get a paper.

1088
01:26:02,889 --> 01:26:04,413
We're in position. More or less.

1089
01:26:04,590 --> 01:26:07,525
Roger. I have the whole
security system online. Just remember...

1090
01:26:07,693 --> 01:26:11,459
Yes, we know.
How about a little radio silence?

1091
01:26:11,631 --> 01:26:15,630
I wanna quit, but what can I do?
He's married to my sister.

1092
01:26:15,802 --> 01:26:20,262
By the way, I reviewed the security tapes
from the explosion at the bakery...

1093
01:26:20,439 --> 01:26:24,466
...and I know that you let those
CONTROL agents get away.

1094
01:26:24,644 --> 01:26:26,908
So unless you do your job today...

1095
01:26:27,079 --> 01:26:33,211
...your lovely wife, Zeenat,
will have eaten her last kebab.

1096
01:26:54,907 --> 01:26:58,809
<i>Blue team, check for access violation</i>
<i>at quadrant three, sector seven.</i>

1097
01:26:58,978 --> 01:27:00,002
Copy that.

1098
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:02,540
Go.

1099
01:27:20,032 --> 01:27:21,727
That's it. You're there.

1100
01:27:53,499 --> 01:27:55,228
Door secure.

1101
01:28:27,767 --> 01:28:30,031
We need to get everyone out
and shut this place.

1102
01:28:30,202 --> 01:28:31,669
We've swept the building.

1103
01:28:31,837 --> 01:28:35,603
The Secret Service doesn't make mistakes
like the fabulous bakery boys.

1104
01:28:35,775 --> 01:28:37,709
Who told you about that? Who told you?

1105
01:28:37,877 --> 01:28:40,141
Take it easy.
You'll give yourself a heart attack.

1106
01:28:40,313 --> 01:28:42,941
And this day will not include
me blowing into your mouth.

1107
01:28:43,115 --> 01:28:46,107
- You want a piece of me?
- Come on, Chief! he's not worth it.

1108
01:28:46,285 --> 01:28:47,912
- Hey.
- I'm shaking. I'm shaking.

1109
01:28:48,087 --> 01:28:49,111
You better watch it.

1110
01:28:49,288 --> 01:28:50,778
Let me at him!

1111
01:29:00,199 --> 01:29:02,099
<i>From Los Angeles, California...</i>

1112
01:29:02,268 --> 01:29:04,125
<i>... we welcome you to a live broadcast...</i>

1113
01:29:04,303 --> 01:29:06,294
<i>... of our concert for the president.</i>

1114
01:29:06,472 --> 01:29:08,940
<i>Dignitaries from around the world</i>
<i>have gathered.</i>

1115
01:29:09,108 --> 01:29:13,545
<i>We will be broadcasting from the Walt</i>
<i>Disney Concert Hall throughout the evening.</i>

1116
01:29:13,713 --> 01:29:16,147
There has got to be another way in.

1117
01:29:16,315 --> 01:29:19,216
Why are we even still here?
There are 50 other perfect targets.

1118
01:29:19,385 --> 01:29:22,786
The Golden Gate Bridge, Space Needle.
There's no chatter to support this.

1119
01:29:22,955 --> 01:29:25,753
And you know what,
I'm done with this. Stop!

1120
01:29:25,925 --> 01:29:29,383
Wait a minute, 23.
You're radioactive hot.

1121
01:29:29,562 --> 01:29:31,621
When were you exposed to radioactivity?

1122
01:29:31,797 --> 01:29:35,096
I just got back from Russia.
Half the people there are radioactive.

1123
01:29:35,267 --> 01:29:36,291
The bakery.

1124
01:29:36,469 --> 01:29:39,097
You said you swept the area
and everything was clean.

1125
01:29:39,271 --> 01:29:41,671
- I did, and it was.
- Really?

1126
01:29:41,841 --> 01:29:44,435
Was there anyone else there,
or do we just trust you?

1127
01:29:44,910 --> 01:29:45,934
23.

1128
01:29:47,113 --> 01:29:48,808
Your knife wound is seeping.

1129
01:29:49,415 --> 01:29:51,246
Sudden rise in blood pressure?

1130
01:29:51,417 --> 01:29:54,750
Perhaps you're nervous because
there is a bomb here and you know it.

1131
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:58,378
And what is with the briefcase?
Could that actually be the football?

1132
01:29:58,557 --> 01:30:01,549
You mean the computer
containing the bomb activation codes?

1133
01:30:01,727 --> 01:30:05,595
Exactly. I have no interest in a real football
unless it is signed by Joe Montana...

1134
01:30:05,765 --> 01:30:07,960
...and I don't believe that's the case.

1135
01:30:09,702 --> 01:30:11,465
Well, 23?

1136
01:30:12,271 --> 01:30:14,296
You know what? We're out of time.

1137
01:30:15,808 --> 01:30:17,867
You follow us, she dies.

1138
01:30:27,686 --> 01:30:29,381
Stop this car!

1139
01:30:29,789 --> 01:30:33,190
Max! You idiot!
What the hell is wrong with you?

1140
01:30:33,359 --> 01:30:36,692
You don't just slap your hands
on a government vehicle!

1141
01:30:38,230 --> 01:30:42,599
All right, that's it! When we get back
to Washington, you morons are through!

1142
01:30:45,738 --> 01:30:49,196
Damn it. How have you gotten
away with this for so long?

1143
01:30:49,375 --> 01:30:51,741
I can't believe none of us saw it,
especially me.

1144
01:30:51,911 --> 01:30:54,311
Don't beat yourself up.
You'll be dead soon anyway.

1145
01:30:56,849 --> 01:30:58,908
Chief, he's heading
southbound on Grand.

1146
01:30:59,085 --> 01:31:00,677
Thanks, Bruce. Keep us posted.

1147
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:04,949
<i>Hey!</i>
<i>CONTROL assholes who just stole my vehicle!</i>

1148
01:31:05,124 --> 01:31:09,561
<i>I know you're listening! You two dickwads</i>
<i>put one scratch on that car...</i>

1149
01:31:10,763 --> 01:31:12,128
<i>What was that?</i>

1150
01:31:12,298 --> 01:31:14,061
Sorry, I'm losing you.

1151
01:31:14,834 --> 01:31:15,858
What the?

1152
01:31:17,336 --> 01:31:19,827
All right, fellas.
20 dollars if you hit the car.

1153
01:31:21,841 --> 01:31:25,675
Chief, I have to say,
this whole thing really steams my clams.

1154
01:31:25,845 --> 01:31:28,541
I cannot get over the fact
that 23 is a traitor.

1155
01:31:28,714 --> 01:31:30,113
Sand trap!

1156
01:31:30,282 --> 01:31:33,115
Now I know how you felt
when you thought I was a traitor.

1157
01:31:33,285 --> 01:31:34,547
Tractor!

1158
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:37,587
I don't know how I missed it.
I'm usually very observant.

1159
01:31:37,756 --> 01:31:39,087
Swordfish!

1160
01:31:46,265 --> 01:31:48,665
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- I don't know.

1161
01:31:48,834 --> 01:31:52,702
Were you thinking, "Holy shit, holy shit,
a swordfish almost went through my head?"

1162
01:31:52,872 --> 01:31:54,396
If so, yes.

1163
01:31:54,573 --> 01:31:55,870
Come on.

1164
01:32:18,397 --> 01:32:21,958
On behalf of the United States Government,
I hereby commandeer this plane.

1165
01:32:22,868 --> 01:32:24,768
The device is armed.
I hope you're moving.

1166
01:32:24,937 --> 01:32:27,906
Don't worry, sir. I'll be well clear.

1167
01:32:32,378 --> 01:32:34,312
<i>Chief, they're headed</i>
<i>southbound on l-47.</i>

1168
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,311
Thanks, Bruce. I got them!

1169
01:32:37,183 --> 01:32:38,912
I need to get down to that car!

1170
01:32:39,084 --> 01:32:42,576
No, no good. If I get too low,
he'll hear me coming!

1171
01:32:46,392 --> 01:32:48,360
I have another idea.

1172
01:32:49,195 --> 01:32:50,856
What are you doing?

1173
01:32:53,365 --> 01:32:56,061
Get back in the plane!
You're gonna kill yourself!

1174
01:32:57,369 --> 01:32:58,666
Hang on!

1175
01:33:15,187 --> 01:33:16,779
Hang on! We're going in!

1176
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:22,686
Sorry, Max.

1177
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:30,962
Tuesday's not gonna work.
Cannot do Tuesday, I'm already...

1178
01:33:31,136 --> 01:33:33,104
- Mom! Mom! Mom!
- Sean! Sean! Sean!

1179
01:33:33,272 --> 01:33:35,297
See how annoying that is?

1180
01:33:55,628 --> 01:33:59,519
See, this is your problem.
Some men like women more feminine!

1181
01:33:59,698 --> 01:34:01,165
- I'm not feminine?
- No.

1182
01:34:01,333 --> 01:34:02,459
I'm not feminine?

1183
01:34:13,379 --> 01:34:14,937
Freeze!

1184
01:34:15,214 --> 01:34:16,909
That was so cool.

1185
01:34:17,816 --> 01:34:19,147
Max!

1186
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:28,684
Damn it to hell.

1187
01:34:38,504 --> 01:34:40,631
You know, I might be more help
if you untie me!

1188
01:34:40,906 --> 01:34:43,272
There's a knife in my right front pocket!

1189
01:34:49,748 --> 01:34:50,976
Stop it! Stop it!

1190
01:34:51,450 --> 01:34:52,474
What?

1191
01:34:53,719 --> 01:34:56,313
That's not my knife! That's not my...

1192
01:34:56,855 --> 01:34:58,152
I got it!

1193
01:35:04,863 --> 01:35:06,524
No, 99, don't touch that!

1194
01:35:09,868 --> 01:35:11,358
Oh, my Lord.

1195
01:35:33,058 --> 01:35:35,151
Yeah! The kid's still got it.

1196
01:35:40,966 --> 01:35:41,990
Max, hurry!

1197
01:35:44,069 --> 01:35:45,832
Hold on, 99!

1198
01:35:51,877 --> 01:35:55,745
Chief, we can't stop the car! We have
the football, but we do not know the code!

1199
01:35:55,914 --> 01:35:57,381
We need to figure out something!

1200
01:35:57,549 --> 01:36:00,382
These tracks are taking us back downtown,
towards the bomb!

1201
01:36:04,823 --> 01:36:07,690
We gotta get you out of there,
and you won't survive the jump!

1202
01:36:07,860 --> 01:36:08,884
I'm coming to get you!

1203
01:36:33,919 --> 01:36:35,978
- Oh, God!
- Hold on, 99!

1204
01:36:37,456 --> 01:36:40,254
It's not over, Max!
I'll take that briefcase!

1205
01:36:40,426 --> 01:36:42,485
If you want it, you'll have to take it!

1206
01:36:42,928 --> 01:36:46,455
- That's what I just said!
- I know, I'm just trying to annoy you!

1207
01:37:35,214 --> 01:37:37,114
Unusual but effective.

1208
01:37:44,890 --> 01:37:46,790
- You all right?
- I'm fine!

1209
01:37:53,098 --> 01:37:54,531
Max!

1210
01:37:55,267 --> 01:37:56,291
Max, your foot!

1211
01:38:02,241 --> 01:38:05,210
- I wish we had more time!
- What?

1212
01:38:25,564 --> 01:38:28,727
- Max!
- No!

1213
01:38:49,588 --> 01:38:51,055
Oh, Max.

1214
01:38:57,129 --> 01:38:58,619
No. No!

1215
01:39:04,269 --> 01:39:06,737
I wish we had more time too.

1216
01:39:09,441 --> 01:39:11,238
So you did hear me?

1217
01:39:14,046 --> 01:39:15,070
Max?

1218
01:39:19,251 --> 01:39:21,082
But the train...

1219
01:39:22,087 --> 01:39:24,282
Missed it by that much.

1220
01:39:43,609 --> 01:39:45,509
"Operation Joy"?

1221
01:39:47,012 --> 01:39:50,846
The "Ode to Joy" will end with a bang.

1222
01:39:55,921 --> 01:39:59,084
- Chief!
- Yeah, Maxie! Are you okay?

1223
01:39:59,257 --> 01:40:03,318
Listen, I think the final notes
of the "Ode to Joy" trigger the bomb!

1224
01:40:03,495 --> 01:40:05,292
We have to stop the concert!

1225
01:40:05,464 --> 01:40:06,761
I'm on it.

1226
01:40:43,268 --> 01:40:46,829
My buttocks are really stinging
from being dragged.

1227
01:40:56,081 --> 01:40:58,515
Hey, grandpa, I already told you...

1228
01:40:59,251 --> 01:41:02,448
Speak up, son.
I'm an old man, you know.

1229
01:41:13,699 --> 01:41:15,963
I like that tackling part.

1230
01:41:20,272 --> 01:41:23,036
I am so, so sorry about that.

1231
01:41:23,208 --> 01:41:25,005
Wait! No, no, let him go.

1232
01:41:25,977 --> 01:41:28,070
- There is a bomb.
- Where?

1233
01:41:28,246 --> 01:41:31,238
Would you believe in the piano?

1234
01:41:36,555 --> 01:41:38,921
Whoa. How did we miss that?
That is huge.

1235
01:41:39,391 --> 01:41:43,885
- Max. Was that...?
- A total guess, yes, it was.

1236
01:41:52,671 --> 01:41:55,162
That old son of a gun
can take a hit, huh?

1237
01:42:02,514 --> 01:42:06,917
- Do you think I should tell him?
- No. Let's just savor the moment.

1238
01:42:15,594 --> 01:42:17,926
He's a funny son of a bitch, isn't he?

1239
01:42:18,630 --> 01:42:21,098
This is the proudest moment of my life!

1240
01:42:24,035 --> 01:42:25,593
Bomb not go off.

1241
01:42:25,771 --> 01:42:28,331
Oh, really, bright-eyes?
What alerted you?

1242
01:42:28,507 --> 01:42:31,635
Was it no "Boom, boom," or the lack
of a mushroom cloud?

1243
01:42:31,810 --> 01:42:34,506
It was the mushroom cloud for me.

1244
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:40,349
Well, you did your job,
so I suppose I can't kill your wife.

1245
01:42:40,752 --> 01:42:44,347
Although to be honest,
I'd be doing the sighted world a favor.

1246
01:42:52,798 --> 01:42:55,096
What good hang time, huh?

1247
01:42:55,834 --> 01:42:59,065
Yes, Mr. President.
Thank you and goodbye, sir.

1248
01:42:59,271 --> 01:43:02,798
86, the President wanted me
to convey his personal thanks...

1249
01:43:02,974 --> 01:43:06,705
...and to tell you how impressed he was
with that dragged-by-a-train thing.

1250
01:43:06,878 --> 01:43:10,974
Well, sir, as an agent, I have trained
myself to be impervious to pain.

1251
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:14,614
Ah! Hey, it's Fang.

1252
01:43:14,786 --> 01:43:17,448
I wanted him to be a surprise.

1253
01:43:17,622 --> 01:43:20,750
99, please, nobody here
knows that we're dating.

1254
01:43:20,926 --> 01:43:22,484
Yes, they do.

1255
01:43:23,762 --> 01:43:25,059
On the cheek.

1256
01:43:26,164 --> 01:43:27,893
- Let's go.
- Maybe a little one?

1257
01:43:28,867 --> 01:43:32,769
Hey, new guy. Hold up a second.
Welcome to CONTROL.

1258
01:43:32,938 --> 01:43:36,169
We have a tradition called "pick on
the new guy." Here's how it works.

1259
01:43:36,341 --> 01:43:39,333
- We pick on the new guy.
- And you can't do anything about it.

1260
01:43:39,511 --> 01:43:40,876
Let's try one.

1261
01:43:41,713 --> 01:43:44,705
- You dropped your pencil.
- Did you hear the man?

1262
01:43:45,116 --> 01:43:48,381
I don't see a man, I see two little girls.

1263
01:43:48,553 --> 01:43:52,580
I think I'll call you Maureen,
and you Brittany.

1264
01:43:52,757 --> 01:43:56,090
- New guy did not.
- New guy did.

1265
01:43:56,261 --> 01:43:58,252
Okay, new guy...
- I got this.

1266
01:43:58,730 --> 01:44:00,220
And I'm going to enjoy it.

1267
01:44:00,398 --> 01:44:02,389
That will make me happy, Maureen.

1268
01:44:02,801 --> 01:44:03,825
Maureen.

1269
01:44:05,303 --> 01:44:06,565
Ow! What's in there?

1270
01:44:07,138 --> 01:44:08,969
- And just for the record.
- What's in there?

1271
01:44:10,542 --> 01:44:12,032
My name is not "new guy."

1272
01:44:13,278 --> 01:44:14,643
My name is Hymie.

1273
01:44:14,813 --> 01:44:17,213
Now, if you ladies will excuse me.

1274
01:44:19,618 --> 01:44:21,381
This is gonna be so fun.

1275
01:44:21,553 --> 01:44:23,145
Make him high-five me.

1276
01:44:57,522 --> 01:44:58,750
Max, we're gonna be late.

1277
01:45:02,761 --> 01:45:05,423
Oh, Max. Let Maintenance
take care of it.

1278
01:45:09,567 --> 01:45:10,659
Ah!

1279
01:45:10,835 --> 01:45:14,007
<i>You've gotta
be kidding me!</i>

1280
01:49:52,417 --> 01:49:54,408
