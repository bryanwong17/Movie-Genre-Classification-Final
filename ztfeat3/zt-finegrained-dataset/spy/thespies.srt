00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,807
<i>Dear citizens</i>

2
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:59,086
<i>North Korea's bombing
in Burma is...</i>

3
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:06,633
<i>North Korea bombed
the mausoleum of Aung San</i>

4
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:10,136
<i>in an attempt to assassinate
President Chun Doo-hwan</i>

5
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:12,806
<i>20 armed spies
came in the East Sea</i>

6
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:14,774
<i>1 captured, 11 committed suicide</i>

7
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:17,944
<i>Explosives and guns
were discovered</i>

8
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:22,749
<i>The couple has a 5 year-old son
in Pyongyang</i>

9
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:27,520
<i>They named him Revolution
to take over South Korea</i>

10
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,723
<i>Chairman Hwang of
the Supreme People's Assembly</i>

11
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:35,595
<i>was targeted by
well-trained spies from the North</i>

12
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:39,292
<i>they disguised as relatives
and approached Hwang</i>

13
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:44,316
<i>The Spy</i>

14
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:54,044
<i>Incheon Port</i>

15
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:08,194
<i>North Korean Foreign Minister,
Lee Yong-sung will soon arrive</i>

16
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:12,153
<i>During the Six-Party Talks
in Beijing last February...</i>

17
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,187
I brought them last time

18
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,623
We can't let this through

19
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,786
But this is okay!

20
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,298
Lee Yong-sung has landed
in South Korea

21
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,934
On April 11th,
Minister Lee and his aid

22
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,937
requested asylum
to the Korean Embassy in Beijing

23
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:56,843
He arrived at Seoul Airport
today at 1 p.m.

24
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:03,976
His 34 days journey here
opens new hopes for reunification

25
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:17,892
Yes?

26
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,892
Let's meet in an hour

27
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:43,985
Show me the goods first

28
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,418
Try biting on it

29
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,470
This really gets it up?

30
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:03,276
Sir, the Chinese hate losing
to the Americans

31
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,345
This is 8 times stronger
than the original

32
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:09,048
But the wrong stuff
could give you heart attacks

33
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:10,883
Come on!

34
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,419
Who cares about that?

35
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,911
We want to get it up
big and strong

36
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:22,155
- Live it up while you can?
- Damn right!

37
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,499
$50,000 for all this then?

38
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,407
Does is say 'idiot'
on my face?

39
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,944
Fine. $55,000

40
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,580
An idiot, all right

41
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,315
Damn idiot!

42
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:43,182
What?

43
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,018
Not you
I'm talking about me

44
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,354
I do this when I'm mad
Don't mind me

45
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,889
You stupid idiot!

46
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,692
Stop living like that!
You idiot!

47
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:55,161
Die! You idiot!
Die!

48
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,997
Then $60,000?

49
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,659
You're on!
Where's the money?

50
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,761
Man...

51
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,013
- Come on
- Oh please!

52
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:16,379
Boss!

53
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,350
How was your trip?

54
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,852
You're back earlier than
expected

55
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,292
What's wrong, Ms. Ko?
Are you sick?

56
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,259
No, sir

57
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:32,921
I'll be right back
A friend's here

58
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,938
What'd you say to her
this time?

59
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:39,905
Nothing...

60
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:41,574
Is it her period?

61
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:42,909
Why you!

62
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,044
I told you to be good to her!

63
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:47,380
Know how hard she has it?

64
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,749
She pays for
her sisters' schooling

65
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,685
and takes care of
her sick mother

66
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,220
Who does that these days?

67
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,450
Many kids are like that

68
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:03,629
Where's the Viagra?

69
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,098
What Viagra?

70
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,700
Sell this cooking oil!
It's rotting!

71
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,535
But no one wants it

72
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,935
You good for nothing ass!

73
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,238
Go plant some hair, will you!

74
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,747
Son of a bitch!

75
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,599
The smell!

76
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,482
<i>Wife</i>

77
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,520
- Hon?
- Where are you?

78
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,588
Just got back
How's Ji-sung?

79
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,257
On the bench

80
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,659
That damn coach!

81
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:07,927
The game's almost over

82
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,224
I'll be right there!

83
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:43,723
Coach?

84
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:48,601
I'm not saying this
because Dong-su's my son

85
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,870
But if he keeps playing like this

86
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,473
I think we can win it!

87
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,441
No problem!

88
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,109
Right?

89
00:07:57,109 --> 00:08:00,346
How about a toast!

90
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,048
- Coach?
- Sure

91
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,450
Go Yeok-buk!

92
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,351
Go Yeok-buk!

93
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,342
- Go Yeok-buk!
- Go!

94
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,222
Stop drinking!

95
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,717
Great day, isn't it?

96
00:08:15,717 --> 00:08:19,025
Wish I could say so

97
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:29,242
I'm sick and tired of
seeing benches

98
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,903
Damn this life

99
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:36,015
I'm just curious

100
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,150
Do you hate me or something?

101
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,448
Of course not

102
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:53,566
I get it
Ji-sung will play next game

103
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,800
Promise?

104
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:01,741
Of course!
He's our secret weapon

105
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,776
He is? Really?

106
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,946
We should save
our secret weapon

107
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,614
Maybe for the finals!

108
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,605
Right! Save him for last!

109
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,623
To secret weapons!

110
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,352
To secret weapons!

111
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:29,769
Sir? What's this?

112
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,237
Give it a try

113
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,068
It'll stay up for 8 hours

114
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:35,666
Oh!

115
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,614
Smoking in
a non-smoking place

116
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:42,842
Bastards!

117
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,516
You know?

118
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:54,327
Some folks pay to play
baseball?

119
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,095
- Really?
- Yes

120
00:09:56,095 --> 00:10:00,555
Some people
They have no shame

121
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:03,859
Got a lot of money?

122
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:05,965
Not coming out right?

123
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:12,111
I heard of some men
getting menopause

124
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,512
Sit down and take your time
in there

125
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,712
Damn!
Come out, already!

126
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,550
Get on mommy's back

127
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,866
Carry Ji-su and go on in
I want to chat with Ji-sung

128
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,334
About what?

129
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:39,071
Guys talk
Ladies can go in first

130
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:41,907
Clean the bathroom
as soon as you come in

131
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:45,478
I did it last time!
Even the kitchen!

132
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:50,850
So? You're gonna skip it
this week?

133
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,986
Of course not
Go on in

134
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,351
Let's go in Ji-su

135
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,949
I talked with your coach today

136
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,691
He has a good plan

137
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:05,031
What plan?

138
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,232
Ji-sung

139
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,067
You're a secret weapon

140
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,770
- I am?
- Yes!

141
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,406
The coach is smarter than
he looks

142
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:16,475
He'll use me in the finals
as a secret weapon?

143
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,102
Exactly!

144
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:20,802
Let's see you swing

145
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,182
Shoulders back

146
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,817
Weight on your right foot

147
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,285
Eyes open wide!

148
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,720
Firm grasp!

149
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,482
And swing!

150
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,848
No! More impact!
Give me that

151
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,520
Eyes open wide!

152
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:40,199
The ball is coming!

153
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,669
Keep your eye on the ball!
Grasp tight!

154
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:44,397
Swing!

155
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,273
Not too hard. Got it?

156
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,852
I'll be right in after a smoke
Get the bat and go

157
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:04,924
Ji-sung!

158
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,653
- Go! Secret weapon!
- Go!

159
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,129
Mama?

160
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,670
Did you eat?

161
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,728
Did you, Mama?

162
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:22,875
Just smacked down a bowl

163
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,044
What's with the cough?

164
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:28,781
Just a cold
You be careful

165
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,249
Mama!

166
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:34,887
Jung-su! Can't hear me?

167
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,321
Mama! Mama!

168
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:47,297
Mama...

169
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,561
The moon's so bright

170
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,944
Real name, Lim Jung-su

171
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:03,215
Graduated from Kim Jong-il University
and sent to spy in 1989

172
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:07,553
He caught our attention
during the 2008 US beef protests

173
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,989
The candlelight protests? How?

174
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:13,826
He said he led it
and asked for operational funds

175
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,061
That fool!

176
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:17,995
He's a con-man, not a spy!

177
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,601
He runs a small trade shop

178
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:26,705
He goes back and forth
between China for goods

179
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,474
His code name is Mr. Kim

180
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:33,045
He's just working hard
to make a living

181
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,080
Nothing happened in China?

182
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,586
He wired some money
to his family in the North

183
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,383
Well, life is hard there

184
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:46,826
Supporting his family up North
and here

185
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,328
He's got it rough

186
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,397
If he didn't do anything
in 3 years

187
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,199
maybe he lost touch
with the North?

188
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,223
That's enough

189
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:56,702
Just arrest him

190
00:13:56,702 --> 00:14:00,673
Something big is bound
to happen, sir

191
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,408
What if it doesn't?

192
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,171
You'll take responsibility?

193
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,849
If it doesn't...

194
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,840
then too bad
It's not my fault

195
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:16,717
Yes?

196
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,526
So bring him in now

197
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,223
Or you're responsible!

198
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,366
Understood?

199
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,128
Yes, sir

200
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:34,230
Son of a bitch!

201

I'm planting hair with this!
Report me if you can!

202
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,292

203

204

Koo! You dare run
with my money!

206

You screwed the wrong guy

207

I got special training!

209

I could rip you up
with my bare hands!

210
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,405
Bring the money
when you can

211

of hell for your family!

336
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,972
They never leave things be

337
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:12,605
- You gained weight
- What? I guess

338
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:17,341
Looks way better than
being gaunt

339
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,849
- Mr. Kim?
- Yes

340
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:28,290
They want his head

341

<i>Lee Yong-Sung</i>

Gather up the gang
and rent an office

343
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:43,141
Your son's name is
Ji-sung, right?

344
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:47,312
He needs to relax his shoulders

345
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:48,870
Tell him to swing smoothly

346
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:52,413
I'm off

347
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:07,325
Get an office with this?
What a joke!

348
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:12,870
When did that guy come over?

349
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:16,669
Just my damn luck!

350
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:25,846
Excuse me

351
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:32,123
Know where a famous restaurant
called Gooksu is around here?

352
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:35,650
It's across the street
to the right

353
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,602
Welcome!

354
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,771
Where have you been?

355
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,906
- Mrs. Wang
- Yes?

356
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:50,008
- How've you been?
- Good

357
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,944
Why didn't you come by?

358
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,242
Found a new favorite place?

359
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,483
I wouldn't do that to you

360
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:01,519
I went to Europe

361
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:02,587
Really? Where?

<i>Counselor Yoon

We'll catch up later

364
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:11,988
- Reservation under Mr. Kim?
- Yes

365
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,163
So many years have passed

366
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:19,337
The good old days

367
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:20,895
Back then

368
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,944
we had conviction and pride
being spies

369
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:27,212
Right

370
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:32,684
Willing to give our lives

You too, right?

372
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:36,910
That's history
Now, I'm busy making a living

373
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:40,992
Do they send money down
these days?

374
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,595
Up to 3 years ago,
they sent a little

375
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:47,429
Now, things aren't the greatest
up there

376
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,734
Nothing for us to do now
All the info is on the internet

377
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:56,007
Right...

378
00:27:56,007 --> 00:28:06,384
They bad-mouth their President
more than Kim Jong-il

379
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:12,084
President Park's time was best

380
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:16,428
Indeed it was

381
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:20,956
Those were the days

Lovely flowers

What?

386
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:40,752
Who came down?

387
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,413
It's Chief Choi

388
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:50,893
We're in for a bloody massacre

389
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,597
This is a steal deal!

00:28:56,597 --> 00:28:58,863
They're redeveloping the area

391
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:03,906

I'll call right back

393

It's $100 short

394
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:14,052
For what?

395
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:15,854
0.3% realtor's fee

396
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:18,823
Want a copy of
real estate law?

397
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:21,322
Who takes that these days?

398
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,262
That's why you got no customers

How much is a cow?

But a cow sells for $500!

478

Cut it out!
Chief Choi is here!

It's been a long time!

504
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,852
How have you been?

505
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:49,581
Yes! Okay!

506
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:54,686
It's been a while
Greet each other, will you?

507
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,163
You two go way back

508
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:03,463
You know? Like this?

509
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:12,536
Been okay?

510
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:15,643
What's with your accent?

511
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:18,476
What's with your body?

512
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:24,714
It happens
when women have babies

513
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,899
It's been so long
Good to see you

514
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,298
How've you been?

515
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:40,471
You all look well

516
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,803
This is all I could get
for the money

517
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:48,179
We're not having a party
This will do

518
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,407
It's great

519
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:55,086
If I gave you much money,
I could pick faults

520
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:59,323
But since I couldn't,
I have no right to say anything

521
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:02,994
I heard how you comrades
were living

522
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,962
You've worked hard
to survive here

523
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:09,399
Our country has never forgotten
all your hard work

524
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:14,605
Please keep doing your best

525
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:18,042
Our mission is to kill
Lee Yong-sung

526
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:20,444
You know how things run here

527
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:24,248
Our expertise is killing
So, you set things up

528
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:26,083
May l?

529
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:26,933
I'm quite old now

530
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:37,662
I'd like to go back home
after this mission

531
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:38,890
Is that possible?

532
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:47,305
You'll go back with us

533
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:48,505
Thank you!

534
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:53,572
Woo has a question

535
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:55,446
I do?

536
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:57,471
About the pay?

537
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:02,919
- Damn bastards!
- How much do you want?

538
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,916
It's okay. Tell me

539
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:12,528
How much do you want?

540
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,884
Long live the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea!

541
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:37,615
Long live General Kim Jong-il!

542
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:43,425
That's good

543
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:28,906
There's never been a more
vicious dictator!

544
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:29,856
He claims communism

545
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:36,147
but we all know very well!

546
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:42,620
It's Kim Jong-il, the fat pig's
dictatorship!

547
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,688
Destroy him!

548
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:46,851
Destroy him!

549
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,026
Destroy him!

550
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:52,163
Destroy him!

551
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,432
Destroy him!

552
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:56,900
- Congratulations
- For what?

553
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,467
Heard you got married
and have a kid

554
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,470
Don't mind my business
and get to work

555
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:08,601
How could you do that to me?

556
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:10,679
Why'd you disappear?

557
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,446
Shit!

558
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,625
Long time no see
Senator Park!

559
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,527
How've you been?

560
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,628
Did you go home safely then?

561
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:26,364
You were really drunk

562
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,566
Do I know you?

563
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:30,835
Chairman Choi!

564
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,536
Pastor! Nice bumping into you

565
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,871
How was your trip
to Washington?

566
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:38,008
Great. I got
Senator Robert Palmer's promise

567
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:40,943
So, the States will help?

568
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:43,948
Professor Hwang?

569
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:44,648
Who are you?

570
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,317
I'm a reporter
from Seoul Daily

571
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:48,085
May I interview you?

572
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:49,220
I see

573
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,290
Then, he is only staying
in his hideout?

574
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,326
Because they'll try
and kill him

575
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:56,961
When he is so sick

576
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:59,088
Damn commies!

577
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:02,066
Is he sick?

578
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:05,035
I heard he has heart trouble

579
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:06,203
But

580
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:10,107
You didn't receive as much
attention as Minister Lee

581
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:13,110
Why do you think that is?

582
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:17,481
I came solely for
a better future for my country

583
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:21,118
He had a different motive

584
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:22,676
What's that?

585
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:25,389
Money?

586
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:26,390
What money?

587
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,659
He got paid for coming over

588
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:30,694
Obviously, he needs to make
a living

589
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:32,525
Think he'd come for free?

590
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:35,531
Must've made a deal

591
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:37,902
How much did he get?

592
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,303
$10 million U.S.

593
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:40,438
$10 million?

594
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,905
That much?

595
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:52,950
Ms. Kang?

596
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,084
Right

597
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:56,754
Lee has heart trouble

598
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:58,656
He received monthly checkups
in the North

599
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:02,326
But he can't go to
a hospital here

600
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:04,195
He can't walk around in public

601
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,564
Knowing he could get killed

602
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:10,267
So, a doctor visits him
regularly?

603
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:14,271
Our first plan is to follow
the doctor and find the hideout

604
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:15,606
Get your guns

605
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:18,370
Grease them up ahead of time

606
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:20,838
You didn't bring any?

607
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,686
We came by plane

608
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:34,692
Sorry, sir

609
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:35,442
<i>Son</i>

610
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:39,163
Must be hard
raising him alone

611
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,289
It's okay, sir

612
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,598
Is that good?

613
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,702
Let me try it

614
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:56,272
I've never tasted coffee

615
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:06,616
Bitter, but nice

616
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:12,056
A successful son drinking coffee...

617
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:16,831
Your mother must be proud

618
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:24,875
We have one week
to kill Lee. Understood?

619
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,467
Yes, sir

620
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:30,106
You brushed your teeth?

621
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:33,647
Such a big boy, now

622
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:36,882
Mommy will come
this Saturday

623
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:40,891
Must be nice
Coming by plane

624
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,860
When we came by subs, right?

625
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,180
I swam over

626
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:53,265
What happened to
Kang's husband?

627
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,040
She got divorced

628
00:42:57,975 --> 00:42:59,306
You should know

629
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,476
You set them up

630
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:06,610
You did?

631
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:11,679
Damn fool still lost in love?
Snap out of it

632
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:23,030
What?

633
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,963
He's lost in love, alright

634
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:29,304
I am not!

635
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,969
I'm a Casanova!

636
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,979
Yeah, whatever

637
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:36,847
Wash up, will you?

638
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:38,872
- You smell like shit
- Quiet

639
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,653
Where'd you put your gun?

640
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:44,450
I buried it in the mountains

641
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:00,698
Mt. Gwangmyeong

642
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:13,072
Damn it!

643
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,616
- Mister?
- Yeah?

644
00:44:16,616 --> 00:44:17,955
Where'd the mountain go?

645
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:20,219
Gone to build apartments

646
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:25,989
Shit! That's why
this country sucks!

647
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,326
Damn it!

648
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:35,800
Our guest is here

649
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:22,146
I'm sorry

650
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:32,087
Honey?

651
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:36,724
You left this at home

652
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:38,667
See you later

653
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:56,211
Let's start with a blood test

654
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:20,577
What's going on?

655
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:29,392
Doctor!

656
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:33,387
Are you okay?

657
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:37,561
I'm so sorry

658
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:39,859
What's the matter with him?

659
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:44,268
My father insists
he can't get a blood test

660
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:45,268
Why?

661
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:50,507
Because he's
a Jehovah's Witness

662
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:53,340
I'm sorry
Have a good day

663
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:04,118
Go straight,then turn right

664
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:07,758
Where would all that money be?

665
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:09,521
Think he used it all?

666
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:13,230
How can that old man
use it all?

667
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:16,133
Unless he had a family

668
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:17,768
Sure he brought
the money here?

669
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:20,270
You said Professor Hwang
said that!

670
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:24,074
But it's not like he saw him
get the money

671
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:28,212
I searched through the internet
He got the money for sure!

672
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:30,314
Stupid? You believe that?

673
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:32,382
Idiot! Remember
the beef protests?

674
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:35,374
Mad Cow disease was
all over the Net

675
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:38,155
Internet is the Alpha
and Omega now

676
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:42,854
It's all made-up
The beef is cheap and good!

677
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,865
Hey! Go that way!

678
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,633
Use your head, will you!

679
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,568
You little twerp!

680
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:55,205
How dare you raise your voice!
You country moron!

681
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:58,375
Damn woman!
Gone mad after eating mad cows?

682
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,743
Crazy bitches deserve
a spanking!

683
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,212
Go ahead! Hit me!

684
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,948
You disrespectful little twerp!
I'm older!

685
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:07,417
Talk with respect!

686
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:09,853
Fine then!

687
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:12,014
Must be nice being old!

688
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:16,451
With wrinkles and sagging tits!

689
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:18,762
Who says!

690
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:20,597
They're as firm as rock!

691
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:22,332
Cut it out!

692
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:24,596
Focus on the money!

693
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:27,699
They did it, alright!

694
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,219
This is it?

695
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:47,955
Nice house
How much is a place like this?

696
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:53,691
This is why
we have nothing to do

697
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:59,799
In the past we went up
mountains to take pics

698
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:02,135
We climbed a lot

699
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:08,139
Here

700
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:11,548
496-24 Pyeongchang-dong

701
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:14,449
See how many surveillance cams
and infrared detectors there are

702
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:20,157
21 surveillance cams
and 1 1 detectors

703
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:21,146
Can we see inside?

704
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:26,630
No technology for that yet

705
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,655
Unless we actually go inside

706
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:31,390
Then, let's go in

707
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,449
Thank you for calling
How may I help you?

708
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:57,027
Our technician will visit
your house soon

709
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:58,688
- Your address, please
- Hello

710
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,191
Your ID, please

711
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:07,397
Come in

712
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:26,456
Now, let's go in

713
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:30,260
4 surveillance cams here
and 3 in the kitchen

714
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:33,497
The front door is the only way
in and out

715
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:37,167
There are 6 guards on watch
24 hours on the first floor

716
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:41,968
They are carrying Beretta 93 guns
at all times

717
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,043
That's the study

718
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:49,179
Mostly books on South Korean
politics and economy

719
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:51,381
Must be reading up
to settle down

720
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,717
But reality is far from books

721
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,550
Could wonder why
he came to live here

722
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:00,924
28 stairs to the second floor

723
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:05,122
The wooden stairs creak,
so be careful

724
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:11,635
The upstairs guards' room
is used for sleeping

725
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:15,072
So, the guards take turn
on shifts

726
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:20,874
Thus, there are always 1 2 agents
on guard here

727
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:24,047
Is there internet in there?

728
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:25,571
No. That's everything

729
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:32,686
Must be the terminal board

730
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:38,261
That must be Lee's bedroom
where the doctor comes out

731
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:41,064
Now, here's the plan

732
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:45,368
It'll be hard to sneak in
with the 24 hour watch

733
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:48,605
There are power lines
all around the neighborhood

734
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,308
Thus, the electric pole!

735
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:54,411
We cut the electricity
and sneak in

736
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:57,447
But we only have 3 minutes

737
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:02,352
The independent power generator
will kick in after 3 minutes

738
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:08,024
We go upstairs to Lee's room,
kill him, then get out in 3 minutes

739
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:09,355
It's a race against time

740
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:14,664
Every Thursday at 3:00 a.m.
the garbage truck comes

741
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:17,634
So, we disguise as such
and go up to the house

742
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:22,298
32 to seconds to go over the fence
and get to the door

743
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:25,942
17 seconds from the door
to the stairs

744
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:29,045
28 stairs at 0.5 seconds each

745
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:30,547
That's 14 seconds

746
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:33,917
From up the stairs
to the room, 1 2 seconds

747
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:37,521
9 seconds to go into
Lee's room and kill him

748
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,623
84 seconds to go in
for the kill

749
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:41,658
84 seconds to come out

750
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:42,359
Thus

751
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:46,193
It'll take 2 minutes 48 seconds
to go in and come out

752
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,527
Kang get a garbage truck
and Woo go up the pole

753
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,135
Why me?

754
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,365
I can go up in 8 seconds

755
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:03,180
The counselor and I will guide

756
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,849
Just come out
within 3 minutes, Chief

757
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:09,478
Vanish into the darkness
before the generator kicks in

758
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:13,490
Got your guns?

759
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:14,980
What?

760
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:17,593
Well...

761
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:20,630
A cow stepped on mine

762
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:21,460
It's broken

763
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:29,673
I have a gun,
but I lost the bullets

764
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:34,444
I buried it in the mountains,
but the mountain's gone

765
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:37,247
Damn too many apartments
these days

766
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:38,327
I'm sorry

767
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:43,051
I left it somewhere

768
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:48,488
Are you okay?

769
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:50,860
Counselor!

770
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:51,724
You smiled?

771
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:55,665
Comrade! Wanna die!

772
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:57,189
Son of a bitch!

773
00:53:58,134 --> 00:54:01,103
'Sorry' is that easy to say?

774
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:19,917
Are you okay?

775
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:28,259
Thank you...

776
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,390
If a meal is set

777
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:37,974
we can't flip the table
because there's no spoon

778
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:40,043
Thank you

779
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:43,035
It's for our country
Don't kill him

780
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:49,349
Let's all live! So you can
make it back to your families!

781
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:52,478
Right, Mr. Kim?

782
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:55,122
Yes...

783
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:01,031
I'll get it

784
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:03,867
Enough with the money!

785
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:05,858
I'll sell my organs
if I have to!

786
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,962
That damn bastard!
Hitting you like that

787
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:14,369
I deserved it

788
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:21,011
Thanks

789
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:27,782
Saw the safe
under the desk?

790
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:36,266
People don't put
black money in banks

791
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:39,497
The $10 million is
definitely in that safe

792
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,906
Get killed by yourself!

793
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:45,041
Think of the cows!

794
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:47,010
What's $1 0 million
divided by 4?

795
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:47,908
$2.5 million

796
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:50,680
We hit the jackpot!

797
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,818
$2.5 million each!
Think about it

798
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:57,620
Our lives are at stake anyway
Let's get paid

799
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:00,824
Who needs a medal later?

800
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:02,223
Kang? What do you say?

801
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,623
Think of your son

802
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:08,094
Let's go!

803
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:10,428
What about you?

804
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,002
Think of the cows

805
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:15,769
Let's go!

806
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:17,273
Now you're talking

807
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:19,409
Counselor Yoon?

808
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:20,159
Me?

809
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:26,149
I have some money saved up

810
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:30,153
But if you guys want it,
I think it'll be fun

811
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:31,450
I knew you'd pull through!

812
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:33,523
Now

813
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:37,983
If Choi's got 3 minutes,
we do it in 2 minutes 20 seconds

814
00:56:39,295 --> 00:56:41,661
Get everything ready
while I go to Busan with Choi

815
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:46,367
We go straight for the money

816
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:49,272
A toast

817
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:51,001
- To success!
- Success!

818
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:06,848
Brought the money?

819
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:10,122
When is the meeting?

820
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:14,324
3 hours from now

821
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:16,865
The sea is nice

822
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:32,681
- It's the same
- Okay!

823
00:57:32,681 --> 00:57:36,240
48 seconds to get to the safe

824
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:40,857
Minus 64 seconds to get out

825
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:43,325
Then, we have 44 seconds
to open the safe

826
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:47,297
Width, 49

827
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,264
Height, 57

828
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:49,253
Length, 51

829
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:53,303
How much?

830
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,270
$1 0 million!

831
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:10,653
That's not right!
Paint it evenly!

832
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:13,056
- This is all wrong!
- I can do this!

833
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:15,149
You don't get it!

834
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:18,461
Stop it! I'll do it!

835
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:21,487
- Why you!
- Fool!

836
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:11,781
It's been a while, Ms. Ma

837
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:12,975
How's business?

838
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:20,456
Getting by in the shitty economy
like everyone else

839
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:24,127
Still dealing Viagra?

840
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:28,298
What are you talking about?

841
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:30,066
I don't deal with that stuff

842
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,935
What the hell?

843
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:33,970
Last time, you asked me to...

844
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:37,064
Cut the nonsense
and show us the goods

845
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:45,137
They want to see the goods

846
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,739
Tell them to show the money first

847
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:54,217
The gentlemen want
to see the money

848
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:59,184
Who'd pay without seeing the goods?

849
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,090
Don't trust us?

850
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:05,230
Think we'd just take the cash and run?

851
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:07,198
There's an old Russian saying

852
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,636
Befriend a bear

853
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:11,863
but always keep an ax at hand

854
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:15,167
Did you live in Russia?

855
01:00:15,167 --> 01:00:18,543
In Moscow for a bit

856
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:31,924
Do you like?

857
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:34,155
It's the best

858
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:38,564
Let's see the money

859
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:50,236
Please...don't...

860
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:03,954
Damn it!

861
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,334
Yeah?

862
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:14,237
What? Busan?

863
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:15,672
Why'd he go?

864
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,907
Probably to catch Koo

865
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:18,608
Anything else?

866
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:20,041
Nothing

867
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:22,044
Shit

868
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:27,250
Kim's just a con-man!

869
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:28,046
What?

870
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,610
Crazy son of a...

871
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:36,082
Eat up

872
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:39,891
Have some more meat

873
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:51,641
I brought your favorite
egg and ham

874
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:52,938
And fried rice

875
01:01:52,938 --> 01:01:54,634
Try this first

876
01:01:58,881 --> 01:01:59,982
Is it good?

877
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:01,950
Yes! Have some, Mom

878
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:06,889
How's residence?
Anyone bothering you?

879
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:11,223
Don't worry
Everyone's great here

880
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,274
I'm sorry Jun-sang

881
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:27,143
About what?

882
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:28,110
Everything

883
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:31,311
You have to go early again?

884
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:36,886
When this job is over
let's live together

885
01:02:36,886 --> 01:02:39,411
Really?
You don't have to work?

886
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,992
I made a lot of money
Mommy's rich

887
01:02:42,992 --> 01:02:46,120
Then, you can get married!

888
01:02:46,562 --> 01:02:47,282
Silly!

889
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:51,122
Let's eat, Son

890
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:12,577
<i>Lee Yong-Sung's Hideout</i>

891
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:36,729
Ready?

892
01:07:08,624 --> 01:07:09,989
Where's Lee?

893
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:20,764
Got it?

894
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,164
I'll ask one last time

895
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:25,830
Where's Lee Yong-sung!

896
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,181
What's this?

897
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:33,045
What?

898
01:07:41,524 --> 01:07:42,218
What!

899
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:10,777
- Run!
- Hurry!

900
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:29,492
- What's wrong!
- Damn it!

901
01:09:38,574 --> 01:09:39,541
It won't start!

902
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:52,146
Bring the car around!

903
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:16,071
Where's Counselor Yoon?

904
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:03,359
Let's go

905
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:04,348
Hurry up!

906
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:30,750
What did you do!

907
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:36,182
Wanna die!

908
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:42,426
How can this happen!

909
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:44,189
Where's Lee?

910
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,197
In his room in the basement

911
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:49,204
Where's the surveillance?

912
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:50,034
This way, sir

913
01:11:53,175 --> 01:11:54,043
What's that?

914
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:55,778
They were standing by

915
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:56,767
6 people

916
01:11:58,013 --> 01:11:59,882
- The old man died?
- Yes

917
01:11:59,882 --> 01:12:02,051
But we didn't kill him

918
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:03,279
They killed him, sir

919
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:06,954
This was in his pocket

920
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:11,349
- Anything else?
- No, sir

921
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:40,654
Comrade Ahn Byung-jik

922
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:42,916
Comrade Baek Yeo-jin

923
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:46,055
Comrade Lim Jung-su

924
01:12:49,465 --> 01:12:52,301
With fattened bellies

925
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:54,292
don't you get
what's going on?

926
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:59,869
Step forward
if you don't want in

927
01:13:02,411 --> 01:13:03,901
It was a damn bathroom

928
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:07,882
You killed comrade Yoon!

929
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:14,214
Go to his house
and burn up all the evidence

930
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,685
Did they do it?

931
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:44,645
Do what?

932
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:50,959
I have some money

933
01:13:50,959 --> 01:13:55,521
But if you guys want it,
I think it'll be fun

934
01:13:56,698 --> 01:13:59,168
I'm quite old now

935
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:04,936
I'd like to go back home
after this mission

936
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:25,227
Joo Eun-hae
Can you live without me?

937
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:26,795
What?

938
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:29,765
Can you raise the kids
without me?

939
01:14:29,765 --> 01:14:31,733
Are you drunk again?

940
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:33,598
So what if I am!

941
01:14:36,004 --> 01:14:37,266
Why'd you ditch me?

942
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:44,778
Then, why didn't you
live well!

943
01:14:46,114 --> 01:14:48,250
Why'd you ditch me
if you can't!

944
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,500
Shit!

945
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:51,913
So what?

946
01:14:53,388 --> 01:14:55,624
Think it would've
worked out with us?

947
01:14:55,624 --> 01:14:57,526
Why not?

948
01:14:57,526 --> 01:14:58,993
No way in hell

949
01:14:59,394 --> 01:15:02,522
Both parents as spies?

950
01:15:04,733 --> 01:15:08,637
There's no future for us

951
01:15:08,637 --> 01:15:10,506
Still don't get it?

952
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:11,996
Shit

953
01:15:25,487 --> 01:15:27,122
I'm sorry

954
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:28,924
So sorry!

955
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:31,293
Damn loser

956
01:15:31,293 --> 01:15:32,555
Stop it, hon

957
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:36,098
What'd you just say?

958
01:15:36,098 --> 01:15:37,666
- What?
- Stop it!

959
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:40,369
- Want a piece of me!
- Stop it!

960
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:43,272
Today's your funeral!

961
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:44,112
Let go!

962
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:50,579
Know who the hell I am!

963
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:53,715
Who cares!
Know who I am?

964
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:56,084
Who the hell are you!

965
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:59,247
Bastard! I'm a spy!

966
01:16:07,262 --> 01:16:09,731
I don't believe this

967
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:14,202
Tattoo it on your forehead
'I'm a spy!'

968
01:16:14,202 --> 01:16:16,271
You'll get yourself killed!

969
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:19,502
Stand up straight!

970
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:22,576
Stay up!

971
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:27,115
Damn fucking life!

972
01:16:27,115 --> 01:16:30,452
That bastard!
I'll kill him

973
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:32,654
Who? Chief Choi?

974
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:35,591
That bastard's
out of your league!

975
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:39,083
If you're a Terrier
he's a Doberman!

976
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:41,463
Shit

977
01:16:41,463 --> 01:16:42,691
How will you do it?

978
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:47,868
How will you kill him?

979
01:16:50,038 --> 01:16:52,598
I can't die
You get me?

980
01:16:54,142 --> 01:16:57,839
So focus and kill Lee
if you don't want to die like Yoon

981
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:06,687
Shit!

982
01:17:24,606 --> 01:17:26,174
When's the last time he came?

983
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:29,578
He ate a good meal
and gave me a big tip

984
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:32,570
I'm a little busy
When did he come last?

985
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:34,247
Wait. Hold on

986
01:17:36,685 --> 01:17:37,879
It was last Wednesday

987
01:17:40,055 --> 01:17:40,885
He came with someone?

988
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:50,766
He's heading out

989
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:55,637
An attempted assassination
on Minster Lee took place

990
01:17:55,637 --> 01:17:59,041
We're meeting at the office
in an hour

991
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:00,372
We must kill him

992
01:18:23,331 --> 01:18:24,599
Keep a distance

993
01:18:24,599 --> 01:18:25,429
Yes, sir

994
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:29,938
Agent Sang don't lose them

995
01:18:29,938 --> 01:18:30,927
Yes, sir

996
01:18:34,743 --> 01:18:36,912
Squad 2, take position

997
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:37,970
Yes, sir

998
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:44,385
<i>Being Followed</i>

999
01:18:46,088 --> 01:18:46,884
Walk past

1000
01:19:17,652 --> 01:19:19,813
He's going into a building

1001
01:19:47,649 --> 01:19:48,750
What happened?

1002
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:49,512
We got him

1003
01:20:04,432 --> 01:20:05,660
Mr. Kim

1004
01:20:08,503 --> 01:20:10,105
It's so hot

1005
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:13,642
What are you doing here?

1006
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:16,236
I'm in a rush
Catch you later

1007
01:20:17,078 --> 01:20:18,204
Lim Jung-su!

1008
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:22,580
Wait

1009
01:20:23,752 --> 01:20:25,185
Let's talk

1010
01:20:28,356 --> 01:20:30,722
Dong-su loves playing
with Ji-sung

1011
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,653
So kind like his mother
who died

1012
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:37,065
How long did you keep watch?

1013
01:20:37,065 --> 01:20:38,633
For 3 years

1014
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:41,329
Ms. Ko spotted you
during the beef protests

1015
01:20:42,437 --> 01:20:44,803
She's our agent

1016
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:48,743
But her mother's sick

1017
01:20:48,743 --> 01:20:51,880
She's a professor of psychology

1018
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:54,449
Pays for her sisters' schooling...

1019
01:20:54,449 --> 01:20:57,819
She's an only child
Grew up in a rich family

1020
01:20:57,819 --> 01:20:59,844
Her family is loaded!

1021
01:21:06,628 --> 01:21:07,788
Now what?

1022
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:14,400
Not like we'll get reunified
by sending you to prison

1023
01:21:15,003 --> 01:21:16,137
Right?

1024
01:21:16,137 --> 01:21:17,627
What do you want?

1025
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:24,534
When's the next hit on Lee?

1026
01:21:28,183 --> 01:21:30,485
You want me to be a rat?

1027
01:21:30,485 --> 01:21:32,578
Think of your family

1028
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:35,023
What did they do?

1029
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:36,854
Just trusted
and depended on you

1030
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:39,761
Our country is like that

1031
01:21:39,761 --> 01:21:43,925
Get branded as a commie once
and it's forever

1032
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:46,434
For life

1033
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:47,731
You get me?

1034
01:22:21,136 --> 01:22:25,300
You'll catch a cold, Sweetie

1035
01:22:43,425 --> 01:22:45,222
Sleeping with the bat

1036
01:23:13,188 --> 01:23:14,587
I'll do it

1037
01:23:16,224 --> 01:23:19,990
But keep your promise

1038
01:23:20,895 --> 01:23:22,430
Good decision

1039
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:25,194
I'll get you off
no matter what

1040
01:23:39,114 --> 01:23:40,046
I checked

1041
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:45,516
He's agent Han Jung-wook
of National intelligence

1042
01:24:07,142 --> 01:24:11,806
We'll be keeping watch
so just act natural

1043
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:22,688
What's up?

1044
01:24:23,758 --> 01:24:26,227
Meeting in a place like this

1045
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:29,458
I just came as Choi said
Where's Kang?

1046
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:34,702
Are you sick?

1047
01:24:34,702 --> 01:24:37,170
Just indigestion

1048
01:24:47,015 --> 01:24:47,913
Get ready

1049
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:53,488
Where's Chief Choi?

1050
01:24:53,488 --> 01:24:55,149
Contact point's been changed

1051
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,794
All agents move out

1052
01:25:11,973 --> 01:25:12,905
Car 1, stay close

1053
01:25:17,412 --> 01:25:18,436
Car 2, keep a distance

1054
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:21,043
Car 3, report location

1055
01:25:21,282 --> 01:25:22,715
Standing by at point

1056
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:27,055
They turned right
towards Sung-san

1057
01:25:27,055 --> 01:25:28,044
Car 1, pull out

1058
01:25:29,524 --> 01:25:30,957
Standby on the other side

1059
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:39,861
Went down an alley

1060
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:40,931
Car 2, pull out

1061
01:26:01,389 --> 01:26:02,624
Take your positions!

1062
01:26:02,624 --> 01:26:03,454
Ready, sir

1063
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:42,897
At 4:00pm today

1064
01:26:42,897 --> 01:26:44,762
We're going in to kill Lee

1065
01:26:47,635 --> 01:26:49,737
We don't know where he is

1066
01:26:49,737 --> 01:26:50,635
How?

1067
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:53,032
Mr. Kim

1068
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:56,945
Tell Han Jung-wook yourself

1069
01:26:56,945 --> 01:27:01,382
What? Who do you mean?

1070
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:02,517
Who's that?

1071
01:27:02,517 --> 01:27:06,321
Agent Han Jung-wook
of National intelligence!

1072
01:27:06,321 --> 01:27:07,015
Don't know?

1073
01:27:08,089 --> 01:27:08,748
Huh!

1074
01:27:10,291 --> 01:27:11,280
Show him!

1075
01:27:18,533 --> 01:27:21,169
What did you talk about
yesterday?

1076
01:27:21,169 --> 01:27:24,172
So friendly?

1077
01:27:24,172 --> 01:27:26,504
Tell Han we're going in!

1078
01:27:28,977 --> 01:27:32,970
If you want to save your son,
you'd better hurry

1079
01:27:35,316 --> 01:27:37,307
If Lee's not dead
by the end of the game

1080
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:41,416
Your son will die!
Got that!

1081
01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:45,458
You son of bitch!

1082
01:27:55,336 --> 01:27:58,134
Call Han now

1083
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:14,555
This is the final game between
Seok and Yeok-buk elementary schools

1084
01:28:14,555 --> 01:28:17,692
We will be broadcasting live

1085
01:28:17,692 --> 01:28:23,324
Welcome to an exciting matchup

1086
01:28:38,613 --> 01:28:39,545
What happened?

1087
01:28:40,248 --> 01:28:43,384
Got a tip saying
our location's been exposed

1088
01:28:43,384 --> 01:28:45,019
They suspect you?

1089
01:28:45,019 --> 01:28:45,519
No

1090
01:28:46,587 --> 01:28:49,657
It came from the North

1091
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:51,826
Then, there's a leak
on our end?

1092
01:28:51,826 --> 01:28:53,928
There's always a rat somewhere

1093
01:28:53,928 --> 01:28:55,963
Has the date been set?

1094
01:28:55,963 --> 01:28:57,899
We attack the hideout today

1095
01:28:57,899 --> 01:28:59,434
What time?

1096
01:28:59,434 --> 01:29:00,492
4:00pm

1097
01:29:04,372 --> 01:29:06,533
- How many?
- Got a lighter?

1098
01:29:15,483 --> 01:29:21,319
If you pull anything,
it's over for you and your family

1099
01:29:24,792 --> 01:29:27,161
I don't care what happens to me

1100
01:29:27,161 --> 01:29:28,185
But...

1101
01:29:29,997 --> 01:29:33,091
If something happens
to my family

1102
01:29:34,736 --> 01:29:38,137
I'll blow up
both countries!

1103
01:29:44,579 --> 01:29:47,949
Pull out when you can

1104
01:29:47,949 --> 01:29:51,185
I'll tell the agents
in advance

1105
01:29:51,185 --> 01:29:52,152
See you later

1106
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:04,397
- It's a hit!
- Looking good!

1107
01:30:04,397 --> 01:30:06,768
Going! Going! Gone!

1108
01:30:06,768 --> 01:30:08,803
Homerun!

1109
01:30:08,803 --> 01:30:09,904
- What a player!
- Yeok-buk Elementary

1110
01:30:09,904 --> 01:30:11,672
ties the game 3 to 3

1111
01:30:11,672 --> 01:30:13,975
What a close match!

1112
01:30:13,975 --> 01:30:16,535
Way to go!

1113
01:30:32,059 --> 01:30:34,896
We cancelled
the press conference

1114
01:30:34,896 --> 01:30:36,227
We'll escort you to Busan

1115
01:30:37,031 --> 01:30:40,660
How long do I have to be
on the run?

1116
01:30:44,739 --> 01:30:45,763
Let's go, sir

1117
01:31:05,259 --> 01:31:06,394
He is going in a van

1118
01:31:06,394 --> 01:31:09,063
A van with plate number 2249

1119
01:31:09,063 --> 01:31:11,395
A van with plate number 2249

1120
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:23,242
Let's go

1121
01:31:39,727 --> 01:31:41,786
30 minutes to the attack

1122
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:18,164
- Be right back
- Hurry Mom

1123
01:32:38,619 --> 01:32:40,177
We attack the hideout today

1124
01:32:44,926 --> 01:32:45,790
Shit!

1125
01:33:40,915 --> 01:33:42,650
Seok Elementary is up to bat

1126
01:33:42,650 --> 01:33:43,484
That's it!

1127
01:33:43,484 --> 01:33:45,679
The ball count is in his favor

1128
01:34:35,436 --> 01:34:35,902
Run!

1129
01:34:36,771 --> 01:34:38,068
Get Lee out of there!

1130
01:34:39,607 --> 01:34:41,336
Freeze! Or you're dead!

1131
01:34:42,977 --> 01:34:44,712
At this rate, we'll all die!

1132
01:34:44,712 --> 01:34:47,442
So you betrayed us
to make it alone?

1133
01:34:48,916 --> 01:34:50,645
I have to protect my family!

1134
01:34:52,019 --> 01:34:55,386
Would you let Jun-sang
live life as a spy's son?

1135
01:35:01,562 --> 01:35:02,358
What would you do?

1136
01:35:45,906 --> 01:35:47,396
Yeo-jin! Wake up!

1137
01:35:53,114 --> 01:35:53,773
Yeo-jin!

1138
01:36:05,159 --> 01:36:06,319
Get Lee out of there!

1139
01:36:10,965 --> 01:36:12,091
Cover his right!

1140
01:36:13,934 --> 01:36:15,265
Hurry! Go!

1141
01:36:18,172 --> 01:36:19,366
Protect him!

1142
01:36:21,709 --> 01:36:22,733
Run!

1143
01:36:30,618 --> 01:36:32,518
Hurry! Run!

1144
01:36:34,789 --> 01:36:35,915
Let's not meet again

1145
01:37:01,749 --> 01:37:02,545
Keep running!

1146
01:37:08,122 --> 01:37:08,918
Go! Go!

1147
01:37:19,867 --> 01:37:20,595
Run!

1148
01:37:21,936 --> 01:37:24,131
Out of the way!

1149
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:27,241
Drive!

1150
01:37:27,241 --> 01:37:28,230
Hurry!

1151
01:37:52,499 --> 01:37:54,235
Mister! Wait!

1152
01:37:54,235 --> 01:37:55,668
Hey!

1153
01:38:23,664 --> 01:38:25,495
Answer the damn phone!

1154
01:38:26,967 --> 01:38:27,763
Go right!

1155
01:39:17,584 --> 01:39:18,551
What are you doing?

1156
01:39:19,386 --> 01:39:20,284
It's over!

1157
01:39:21,121 --> 01:39:22,756
It's not over!

1158
01:39:22,756 --> 01:39:24,781
Call and cancel your order!

1159
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:28,729
Don't just think of your kid!

1160
01:39:28,729 --> 01:39:30,594
Think of our home country!

1161
01:39:31,098 --> 01:39:33,567
The hell with all that!

1162
01:39:33,567 --> 01:39:35,202
What did you ever do for us!

1163
01:39:35,202 --> 01:39:36,191
You and me!

1164
01:39:36,837 --> 01:39:40,274
We live and die
upon command!

1165
01:39:40,274 --> 01:39:41,942
I was just following orders!

1166
01:39:41,942 --> 01:39:44,410
Cut the crap
and make the call!

1167
01:39:49,516 --> 01:39:50,676
For our country!

1168
01:41:16,737 --> 01:41:18,898
1 out, bottom of the 6th
Here's the pitch!

1169
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:21,508
He's tensed

1170
01:41:21,508 --> 01:41:24,878
He needs to believe in himself!

1171
01:41:24,878 --> 01:41:28,575
Yeok-buk Elementary is losing
4 to 3 in their last at bat

1172
01:41:33,921 --> 01:41:34,521
Hello?

1173
01:41:34,521 --> 01:41:36,423
Why didn't you pick up!
Where's Ji-sung?

1174
01:41:36,423 --> 01:41:37,191
What?

1175
01:41:37,191 --> 01:41:38,158
I can't hear you!

1176
01:41:38,158 --> 01:41:39,193
Where's Ji-sung!

1177
01:41:39,193 --> 01:41:41,457
Where else? On the bench!

1178
01:41:46,533 --> 01:41:47,801
What's with him?

1179
01:41:47,801 --> 01:41:49,903
- Strike out!
- Han Dong-su...

1180
01:41:49,903 --> 01:41:51,336
- Time!
- I don't understand

1181
01:41:52,172 --> 01:41:54,441
I'm the secret weapon

1182
01:41:54,441 --> 01:41:55,542
Ji-sung

1183
01:41:55,542 --> 01:41:56,440
Get ready to bat

1184
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:57,711
Yes!

1185
01:41:57,711 --> 01:41:59,446
Here's the pinch hitter

1186
01:41:59,446 --> 01:42:01,815
It's Kim Ji-sung

1187
01:42:01,815 --> 01:42:04,585
Ji-sung! It's your brother!

1188
01:42:04,585 --> 01:42:06,653
Go secret weapon!

1189
01:42:06,653 --> 01:42:08,122
He's a reserve player

1190
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:08,622
Go Ji-sung!

1191
01:42:08,622 --> 01:42:10,988
He's a backup player

1192
01:42:25,472 --> 01:42:28,566
Can Kim Ji-sung come out on top?

1193
01:42:29,109 --> 01:42:29,507
Strike!

1194
01:42:40,554 --> 01:42:41,021
Go Ji-sung!

1195
01:42:41,021 --> 01:42:43,421
- What a tense moment
- Sure is

1196
01:42:52,366 --> 01:42:55,733
One homerun could
turn the game around

1197
01:42:56,303 --> 01:42:57,736
Here's the pitch!

1198
01:42:58,772 --> 01:42:59,940
Shoulders back

1199
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:00,807
Weight on your right foot

1200
01:43:00,807 --> 01:43:01,899
Eyes open wide

1201
01:43:03,644 --> 01:43:06,213
The ball is coming!

1202
01:43:06,213 --> 01:43:08,215
Keep your eye on the ball!

1203
01:43:08,215 --> 01:43:09,375
Grasp the bat tightly!

1204
01:43:32,306 --> 01:43:33,774
He's hit!

1205
01:43:33,774 --> 01:43:36,944
- Kim Ji-sung is down
- Ji-sung!

1206
01:43:36,944 --> 01:43:40,180
I hope it's not a serious injury

1207
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:43,150
Ji-sung! Move!

1208
01:43:43,150 --> 01:43:44,117
It's dangerous!

1209
01:43:44,117 --> 01:43:44,885
It's daddy!

1210
01:43:44,885 --> 01:43:47,321
That's not right

1211
01:43:47,321 --> 01:43:48,922
- Is he the father?
- Not sure

1212
01:43:48,922 --> 01:43:50,557
Ji-sung!

1213
01:43:50,557 --> 01:43:53,492
He looks drunk!

1214
01:43:54,861 --> 01:43:56,430
Kim Ji-sung is getting up!

1215
01:43:56,430 --> 01:43:58,523
He's running to the mound!

1216
01:43:59,299 --> 01:44:04,104
- Stop it!
- This is unbelievable!

1217
01:44:04,104 --> 01:44:06,436
All the players are out
on the field!

1218
01:44:08,875 --> 01:44:11,173
Ji-sung! Run!

1219
01:44:49,283 --> 01:44:51,046
How many years do I get?

1220
01:44:57,991 --> 01:44:59,754
Well, there is one way

1221
01:45:02,596 --> 01:45:07,226
Instead of going to prison,
how about working for us?

1222
01:45:09,503 --> 01:45:13,837
You're asking me to be
a spy for you?

1223
01:45:15,742 --> 01:45:17,972
It's the only way you have

1224
01:45:18,912 --> 01:45:20,880
for our country

1225
01:45:22,949 --> 01:45:24,177
and your family

1226
01:45:29,489 --> 01:45:34,027
There was a second attempt
to assassinate Lee Yong-sung

1227
01:45:34,027 --> 01:45:37,664
The assassins from North Korea
were all found dead at the scene

1228
01:45:37,664 --> 01:45:38,598
Next news

1229
01:45:38,598 --> 01:45:40,395
An explosion at a baseball field...

1230
01:45:41,435 --> 01:45:42,197
Hello?

1231
01:45:43,003 --> 01:45:45,335
Son! How are you?

1232
01:45:46,273 --> 01:45:48,969
Mama! I'm fine

1233
01:45:50,377 --> 01:45:51,344
Did you eat?

1234
01:45:52,746 --> 01:45:55,615
I made chicken soup today

1235
01:45:55,615 --> 01:45:59,920
Thinking of you,
I can't bear to eat it

1236
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:04,391
You used to love
my chicken soup

1237
01:46:04,391 --> 01:46:09,796
Feels like just yesterday
you'd slurp up a bowl

1238
01:46:09,796 --> 01:46:11,093
Did you eat?

1239
01:46:21,074 --> 01:46:23,975
Son? Is something wrong?

1240
01:46:24,978 --> 01:46:26,206
Nothing's wrong

1241
01:46:27,514 --> 01:46:29,583
How are you Mama?

1242
01:46:29,583 --> 01:46:31,785
Same old as usual

1243
01:46:31,785 --> 01:46:34,754
By chance
did you wire the money?

1244
01:46:39,025 --> 01:46:43,519
I'll send it soon
Don't worry

1245
01:46:44,598 --> 01:46:47,234
Don't worry about it

1246
01:46:47,234 --> 01:46:50,604
Who needs a big wedding anyway?

1247
01:46:50,604 --> 01:46:54,005
Damn girl doesn't get
how hard it is for her brother

1248
01:46:54,641 --> 01:46:56,810
Did you go see a doctor?

1249
01:46:56,810 --> 01:46:59,880
Don't worry. I'm fine

1250
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:02,015
Why don't you go!

1251
01:47:02,015 --> 01:47:04,184
Listen to me
and go to the hospital!

1252
01:47:04,184 --> 01:47:06,753
Fool!
Why're you yelling!

1253
01:47:06,753 --> 01:47:09,389
How dare you yell at Mama!

1254
01:47:09,389 --> 01:47:11,024
Come on, Mama!

1255
01:47:11,024 --> 01:47:15,256
If you don't want to die,
go see a doctor now!

1256
01:47:16,396 --> 01:47:18,465
You fool!

1257
01:47:18,465 --> 01:47:24,704
Then, send the money so I can
go to the hospital!

1258
01:47:24,704 --> 01:47:26,865
Why always me!

1259
01:48:06,513 --> 01:48:07,411
That's it!

1260
01:48:10,116 --> 01:48:11,811
Yes! Dong-su!

1261
01:48:18,859 --> 01:48:19,689
How're the peonies?

1262
01:48:20,126 --> 01:48:22,896
They don't bloom that easily

1263
01:48:22,896 --> 01:48:24,531
Sure they didn't?

1264
01:48:24,531 --> 01:48:26,897
First time they bloomed
in 1 0 years

1265
01:48:28,668 --> 01:48:30,135
Got any money, pal?

1266
01:48:32,806 --> 01:48:34,341
You know I saved Dong-su

1267
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:35,175
Get it straight

1268
01:48:35,175 --> 01:48:36,676
Your son saved him, not you!

1269
01:48:36,676 --> 01:48:39,479
Same difference, man!

1270
01:48:39,479 --> 01:48:42,916
Lend me $30 grand?
I'll pay you in 3 months

1271
01:48:42,916 --> 01:48:43,541
Yeah?

1272
01:48:45,519 --> 01:48:46,417
When?

1273
01:48:48,488 --> 01:48:49,580
Okay. Be right there

1274
01:48:50,490 --> 01:48:51,740
Shit!

1275
01:48:52,926 --> 01:48:54,227
Lee died

1276
01:48:54,227 --> 01:48:56,129
Really? How?

1277
01:48:56,129 --> 01:48:58,098
Heart attack

1278
01:48:58,098 --> 01:49:02,592
I heard he had a bad heart
Too bad

1279
01:49:05,505 --> 01:49:06,606
So, they'll announce it soon?

1280
01:49:06,606 --> 01:49:09,009
- I guess
- When?

1281
01:49:09,009 --> 01:49:11,811
Probably tomorrow
Why?

1282
01:49:11,811 --> 01:49:14,814
Just wondering
So cold!

1283
01:49:14,814 --> 01:49:16,683
Gotta go

1284
01:49:16,683 --> 01:49:18,084
Call if the peonies bloom

1285
01:49:18,084 --> 01:49:19,786
In this cold?

1286
01:49:19,786 --> 01:49:22,589
- Call me!
- I will!

1287
01:49:22,589 --> 01:49:23,390
Take care

1288
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:24,584
Enough homeruns, Son!
Bye!

1289
01:49:30,363 --> 01:49:31,022
Ji-sung!

1290
01:49:32,132 --> 01:49:32,826
Secret weapon!

1291
01:49:41,875 --> 01:49:44,844
Relax your shoulders!

1292
01:49:58,358 --> 01:50:00,883
<i>Won over Lee's doctor</i>

1293
01:50:01,995 --> 01:50:05,089
<i>Changed Heart Medicine
to Viagra and Lee died</i>

1294
01:50:05,498 --> 01:50:08,990
<i>Request Overdue
Operational Fund</i>

1295
01:50:29,522 --> 01:50:30,819
Watch it!

1296
01:50:36,129 --> 01:50:37,391
<i>Peonies Bloomed!</i>

1297
01:50:42,202 --> 01:50:44,534
Damn! Blooming in the winter!

1298
01:51:04,824 --> 01:51:06,815
Here's your steak

1299
01:51:10,730 --> 01:51:11,389
Wait

1300
01:51:13,299 --> 01:51:15,201
What's the beef's ID?

1301
01:51:15,201 --> 01:51:17,761
We only use Grade A
American beef

1302
01:51:21,675 --> 01:51:22,475
We're leaving

1303
01:51:22,475 --> 01:51:25,879
Come on!
It's embarrassing

1304
01:51:25,879 --> 01:51:28,448
You still don't get it?

1305
01:51:28,448 --> 01:51:32,185
What if Jun-sang goes mad
by eating mad cow?

1306
01:51:32,185 --> 01:51:33,687
Please!

1307
01:51:33,687 --> 01:51:35,382
I'm warning you

1308
01:51:36,656 --> 01:51:38,248
They did it, alright!

1309
01:51:52,472 --> 01:51:54,940
Mom? Do you have to go again?

1310
01:52:04,117 --> 01:52:05,482
I'll pay you $30,000

1311
01:52:07,487 --> 01:52:10,650
Does it say, 'idiot'
on my face?

1312
01:52:11,391 --> 01:52:15,428
Come here you!
Where's my money, fool!

1313
01:52:15,428 --> 01:52:17,430
I planted hair with it

1314
01:52:17,430 --> 01:52:20,194
You son of a bitch!

1315
01:52:21,067 --> 01:52:25,638
Let go! Let go!

1316
01:52:25,638 --> 01:52:28,835
Cut! That's a wrap!
