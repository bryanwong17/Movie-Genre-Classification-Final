1
00:01:15,515 --> 00:01:17,175
INSPECTOR CHAN

2
00:01:50,345 --> 00:01:53,335
SUPER CRIME FIGHTERS

3
00:02:04,395 --> 00:02:06,525
Anyone else?

4
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:16,865
Such a beautiful woman...

5
00:02:17,035 --> 00:02:20,405
...and you arrest her...

6
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:23,305
...just for spitting?

7
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:27,215
Is there no justice?

8
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:30,475
Is there no law?

9
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:34,045
Commissioner is only your boss...

10
00:02:34,225 --> 00:02:36,815
...because he paid his dues
to the Crocodile Gang.

11
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:39,995
And you don't fucking know me?

12
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:43,795
Sorry, I didn't know
she was your wife.

13
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:47,895
Ugly coward!

14
00:02:58,185 --> 00:03:01,415
What are you looking at? Never seen
such a handsome gang boss?

15
00:03:08,295 --> 00:03:10,695
Who'd be in the film business?

16
00:03:10,865 --> 00:03:13,625
It's Sunday,
and the theater's deserted.

17
00:03:14,465 --> 00:03:15,935
Where's the car?

18
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:28,765
Let's go back inside!

19
00:03:50,335 --> 00:03:51,855
Call for help!

20
00:03:54,005 --> 00:03:56,635
No need for that, Northerner.

21
00:03:56,805 --> 00:04:02,145
While you were messing with the cop,
your men signed up with us.

22
00:04:03,715 --> 00:04:06,645
I'll kill all you Axe Gangsters!

23
00:04:40,285 --> 00:04:44,515
Stop! You forget the time
I treated you to dinner.

24
00:04:55,565 --> 00:04:56,725
Brother Sum.

25
00:05:04,445 --> 00:05:05,565
Please...

26
00:05:07,315 --> 00:05:08,975
Please spare me.

27
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,375
Don't worry.

28
00:05:11,985 --> 00:05:15,785
I don't kill women. You can go!

29
00:05:16,555 --> 00:05:18,215
Thank you, Big Brother.

30
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,795
Cops! Come clean up the mess!

31
00:06:52,915 --> 00:06:56,645
THE AXE GANG

32
00:06:58,825 --> 00:07:00,025
In a time of social unrest
and disorder...

33
00:07:00,025 --> 00:07:00,755
In a time of social unrest
and disorder...

34
00:07:00,925 --> 00:07:03,725
...the gangs have moved in
to consolidate their power.

35
00:07:03,895 --> 00:07:06,325
The most feared of them all
is the Axe Gang.

36
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,325
Only in the poorest districts,
which hold no interest for the gangs...

37
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:12,165
...can people live in peace.

38
00:07:14,675 --> 00:07:16,335
PIG STY ALLE Y

39
00:07:37,295 --> 00:07:38,785
One, two, three!

40
00:07:39,865 --> 00:07:41,695
- That okay, Coolie?
- No problem!

41
00:07:59,815 --> 00:08:01,215
TAILOR

42
00:08:05,555 --> 00:08:06,955
NOODLES AND CONGEE

43
00:08:27,745 --> 00:08:30,335
My check, please, Donut.

44
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:36,245
- How much?
- It's on the house!

45
00:08:36,455 --> 00:08:37,615
Donut.

46
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:40,115
- It's nothing.
- I like you.

47
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:43,285
I'll ask the wife about
lowering your rent.

48
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:46,695
Morning, Landlord!

49
00:08:48,765 --> 00:08:49,755
Landlord!

50
00:08:49,935 --> 00:08:51,595
Jill! How you've grown!

51
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,965
Come let me examine you!

52
00:09:06,615 --> 00:09:08,945
Good to see you, Landlord!

53
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,605
What's so good about it?

54
00:09:10,785 --> 00:09:11,945
Don't...!

55
00:09:17,795 --> 00:09:23,125
Can you make the skirt slit higher?

56
00:09:23,795 --> 00:09:25,325
Sure!

57
00:09:25,505 --> 00:09:26,965
Look, a comet!

58
00:09:30,505 --> 00:09:31,995
Jane! You naughty girl!

59
00:09:32,175 --> 00:09:35,875
Landlord! You're such a scoundrel!

60
00:09:38,015 --> 00:09:43,005
Don't go, Jane! Stay and chat!

61
00:09:43,315 --> 00:09:46,485
I'm only kidding. Jane!

62
00:10:06,945 --> 00:10:08,345
Landlady!

63
00:10:09,145 --> 00:10:10,615
Landlady!

64
00:10:13,715 --> 00:10:16,245
What happened to the water?

65
00:10:30,695 --> 00:10:31,855
Water ain't free!

66
00:10:32,035 --> 00:10:36,265
You talk a lot for someone
who won't pay his rent.

67
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:40,135
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.

68
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:41,775
You think that's a problem?

69
00:10:41,945 --> 00:10:44,975
From now on, no water on Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays.

70
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,085
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays
and Saturdays.

71
00:10:48,255 --> 00:10:53,115
I just love hearing you fools
complain. Assholes!

72
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:54,485
Good morning, Landlady!

73
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:58,885
Just pay your rent,
or I'll burn your shop down.

74
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,795
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!

75
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:08,725
Serves you right you're a coolie!

76
00:11:08,905 --> 00:11:12,105
Months overdue and not even
a "good morning."

77
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:14,135
You'll be a coolie for life.

78
00:11:20,115 --> 00:11:21,985
There you go, handsome!

79
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:28,355
What took you so long
with the congee?

80
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:31,425
I stopped to help an old lady
cross the street.

81
00:11:31,595 --> 00:11:34,355
- What are you doing here?
- Checking for Peeping Toms.

82
00:11:34,535 --> 00:11:36,765
Was someone just spying on you,
Auntie Six?

83
00:11:36,935 --> 00:11:40,495
Don't shoot your mouth off
without proof.

84
00:11:43,605 --> 00:11:46,545
She's crazy.

85
00:12:19,075 --> 00:12:20,805
Go away!

86
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:42,225
Please can you teach us, sir?

87
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:43,495
No more soccer!

88
00:13:19,805 --> 00:13:22,035
- Who wants the cut?
- My boss.

89
00:13:24,705 --> 00:13:25,865
Take a seat.

90
00:13:36,755 --> 00:13:39,245
Done! Fifty cents, please.

91
00:13:40,725 --> 00:13:42,285
Isn't it great?

92
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,085
It's too good!

93
00:13:44,965 --> 00:13:47,125
Why'd you make him look so good?

94
00:13:47,835 --> 00:13:49,225
Why?

95
00:13:56,635 --> 00:14:00,305
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy. I'll handle this.

96
00:14:02,315 --> 00:14:05,975
He's boss of the Axe Gang. Don't you
see the two axes? We're bad guys.

97
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,985
Making him look good
is really bad. Understand?

98
00:14:09,155 --> 00:14:11,445
- I didn't know.
- You're a numskull!

99
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:15,245
But I like you, so just pay me,
and I'll take care of it.

100
00:14:15,425 --> 00:14:16,485
No way!

101
00:14:18,765 --> 00:14:22,525
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.

102
00:14:24,705 --> 00:14:28,265
I really care for you. You saw it
for yourself. Seriously.

103
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:32,775
Why don't you pay up. Not much.
Enough for a drink.

104
00:14:32,945 --> 00:14:35,105
Oh, so it's blackmail!

105
00:14:36,945 --> 00:14:38,275
Boss!

106
00:14:39,115 --> 00:14:40,275
Boss!

107
00:14:44,115 --> 00:14:47,285
Now you're dead!

108
00:14:47,455 --> 00:14:49,985
Looks like he's waking up!

109
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:51,495
I'm not afraid.

110
00:14:51,665 --> 00:14:53,625
You can kill me.

111
00:14:53,795 --> 00:14:57,195
But there'll be thousands more of me!

112
00:15:00,405 --> 00:15:03,665
You want to play tough? The Axe
Gang boss is napping in there.

113
00:15:03,835 --> 00:15:05,635
Whoever wants to die,
step forward.

114
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:10,415
So you want to fight?

115
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:13,635
Great! We'll go one-on-one.

116
00:15:13,815 --> 00:15:16,975
Don't even think about cheating.

117
00:15:17,355 --> 00:15:18,975
That old woman with the onion!

118
00:15:21,325 --> 00:15:26,655
You look real tough. Want to try me?
I'll let you hit me first.

119
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:32,765
What do you do?

120
00:15:32,935 --> 00:15:34,665
I'm a farmer.

121
00:15:34,835 --> 00:15:38,325
Farmers don't fight. Piss off!

122
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:39,875
He's crazy!

123
00:15:40,045 --> 00:15:41,565
Calling me names?

124
00:15:41,745 --> 00:15:44,335
You're lucky you're a woman.

125
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:50,785
Hey, shorty! Yeah, you!
If you're short, you don't retort.

126
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:57,695
What did I say about cheating?

127
00:15:57,855 --> 00:15:59,125
Sit back down!

128
00:16:02,135 --> 00:16:04,795
You! The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.

129
00:16:07,975 --> 00:16:11,095
No, not you. I mean...

130
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:12,395
You!

131
00:16:12,575 --> 00:16:15,305
Hey, kid, let's rumble!

132
00:16:17,245 --> 00:16:19,075
All right, all right!

133
00:16:19,385 --> 00:16:22,945
So no one-on-ones today.

134
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,315
You're all such wimps!

135
00:16:28,225 --> 00:16:30,385
He blackmailed me.

136
00:16:30,795 --> 00:16:33,955
Fat woman, you're
in charge here, right?

137
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,895
Fat woman, my ass!

138
00:16:36,135 --> 00:16:37,825
I'm with the Axe Gang!

139
00:16:38,005 --> 00:16:39,125
Axe Gang, my ass!

140
00:16:39,305 --> 00:16:40,295
Boss!

141
00:16:40,465 --> 00:16:42,065
Boss, my ass!

142
00:16:42,305 --> 00:16:44,495
- You have to pay our medical bills!
- Bills, my ass!

143
00:16:44,675 --> 00:16:46,935
- We're on the same side!
- Same side, my ass!

144
00:16:50,615 --> 00:16:53,245
Think you're so tough?
I'll call for backup!

145
00:16:53,485 --> 00:16:57,915
You nitwit! Let's see you call backup!

146
00:16:59,255 --> 00:17:02,915
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.

147
00:17:04,425 --> 00:17:09,095
Don't you go away! Go put
a down payment on your coffin!

148
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,045
Who threw the firecracker?

149
00:17:30,285 --> 00:17:31,775
I'm one of you, brother.

150
00:17:54,145 --> 00:17:55,635
Mind your own business!

151
00:17:55,815 --> 00:17:59,305
It's raining. Go bring in your laundry!

152
00:17:59,585 --> 00:18:00,875
Fat woman!

153
00:18:13,865 --> 00:18:18,165
You blackmailing me too? I ain't afraid.

154
00:18:34,485 --> 00:18:35,475
I...

155
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,165
Did anyone see what happened?

156
00:18:59,175 --> 00:19:01,835
Don't! My back's broken!

157
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:05,305
Call for help!

158
00:19:58,535 --> 00:20:01,995
Hold on, calm down. You hungry?

159
00:20:27,295 --> 00:20:28,555
Keep quiet.

160
00:20:43,975 --> 00:20:45,375
No.

161
00:21:09,175 --> 00:21:10,725
Who did this?

162
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:16,505
I'll count to three.

163
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:20,505
One...

164
00:21:24,115 --> 00:21:26,085
...two...

165
00:21:37,565 --> 00:21:38,725
I did it!

166
00:24:56,535 --> 00:24:58,435
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?

167
00:25:00,505 --> 00:25:01,735
Sorry!

168
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:06,865
Look away, kid.

169
00:25:11,145 --> 00:25:12,475
Get rid of him!

170
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,835
We're the bad guys!

171
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,045
We're meant to do the ass-kicking...

172
00:25:19,025 --> 00:25:21,145
...not the other way around.

173
00:25:21,325 --> 00:25:24,655
And it's all because these morons
posed as Axes.

174
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:28,055
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.

175
00:25:28,225 --> 00:25:30,995
We'll handle this.

176
00:25:31,165 --> 00:25:33,065
You! Take care of it.

177
00:25:47,285 --> 00:25:52,345
- Boy, can this guy pick locks.
- It's a living. Give me a break.

178
00:25:52,525 --> 00:25:55,185
Pick that one too, if you're so good.

179
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:56,575
Come.

180
00:25:57,295 --> 00:26:00,095
I'll count to three.

181
00:26:00,895 --> 00:26:01,915
Hurry!

182
00:26:03,665 --> 00:26:05,495
Ready? Three!

183
00:26:15,515 --> 00:26:17,305
That's quick!

184
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:21,175
Brother Sum, we really
want to be Axes.

185
00:26:21,345 --> 00:26:24,255
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.

186
00:26:24,585 --> 00:26:25,915
Ever killed anyone?

187
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,575
I've always thought about it.

188
00:26:28,925 --> 00:26:30,355
Then go kill someone.

189
00:26:30,525 --> 00:26:32,495
I will!

190
00:26:33,865 --> 00:26:34,925
Go on!

191
00:26:35,335 --> 00:26:36,825
Thank you, Brother Sum.

192
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:51,865
We can always find a use for that type.

193
00:26:55,285 --> 00:26:58,115
I told you before,
you've got to look tough.

194
00:26:58,285 --> 00:26:59,775
Tougher!

195
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:02,885
Tougher!

196
00:27:04,955 --> 00:27:06,515
Act the part.

197
00:27:06,695 --> 00:27:08,165
And try to stay awake.

198
00:27:08,325 --> 00:27:09,695
It's tiring being tough.

199
00:27:09,865 --> 00:27:12,955
Tiring? It's our living!

200
00:27:14,105 --> 00:27:17,795
The streets out there are filled
with money and women.

201
00:27:17,975 --> 00:27:20,705
You only need the will
and determination...

202
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:24,205
...to seize the opportunity to win.

203
00:27:24,475 --> 00:27:26,035
This is our big chance!

204
00:27:26,215 --> 00:27:28,915
We just kill someone,
and we're in the gang.

205
00:27:29,385 --> 00:27:32,875
Then it'll be money and women
all the way!

206
00:27:33,825 --> 00:27:36,685
Don't be like those beggars...

207
00:27:36,895 --> 00:27:39,625
...with no ambition.

208
00:27:44,565 --> 00:27:47,725
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!

209
00:27:49,105 --> 00:27:50,735
Get lost!

210
00:27:51,075 --> 00:27:52,405
Come here and say that!

211
00:27:52,575 --> 00:27:54,735
- You're really gonna kill someone?
- That's right!

212
00:27:54,905 --> 00:27:58,505
The four-eyes, the fat woman
and all the residents of Pig Sty.

213
00:27:58,685 --> 00:28:00,445
But they're good at kung fu.

214
00:28:00,615 --> 00:28:03,445
- I can do kung fu!
- Oh, yeah?

215
00:28:05,585 --> 00:28:09,245
Didn't I tell you I know
Buddhist Palm kung fu?

216
00:28:11,055 --> 00:28:14,495
Hey there, handsome boy. Stop.

217
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,925
Amazing!

218
00:28:19,335 --> 00:28:23,605
Do you know you have
a special aura?

219
00:28:24,205 --> 00:28:27,645
You're so young, but you have
the bone structure...

220
00:28:27,805 --> 00:28:31,215
and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.

221
00:28:31,775 --> 00:28:35,975
If your chi flow can be channeled,
then you will be invincible!

222
00:28:36,155 --> 00:28:39,715
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.

223
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:44,955
The duty of upholding world peace
and punishing evil will be yours.

224
00:28:45,465 --> 00:28:46,445
Sure.

225
00:28:47,365 --> 00:28:50,795
This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
It's priceless.

226
00:28:50,965 --> 00:28:54,495
But as it's fate,
I'll let you have it for $ 10.

227
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,825
BUDDHIST PALM MANUAL

228
00:29:02,775 --> 00:29:05,335
- You gave him your life savings?
- Yes.

229
00:29:05,515 --> 00:29:08,775
I was saving to study to be
a doctor or lawyer...

230
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:11,355
...but this was world peace.

231
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:37,705
Let go of the girl!

232
00:29:56,665 --> 00:29:59,495
Hey! It's the Buddhist Palm!

233
00:29:59,835 --> 00:30:01,995
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu Manual."

234
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,895
You must be loaded.

235
00:30:04,305 --> 00:30:06,465
Have you killed anyone lately?

236
00:30:17,755 --> 00:30:22,655
He's a fool, and she's mute. Losers!

237
00:30:24,425 --> 00:30:28,255
I realized then that good guys
never win. I want to be bad.

238
00:30:29,095 --> 00:30:31,195
I want to be the killer!

239
00:30:32,505 --> 00:30:34,695
- Ice cream!
- Where?

240
00:30:35,505 --> 00:30:37,265
Make mine a vanilla.

241
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:38,805
Chocolate for me!

242
00:30:50,355 --> 00:30:53,345
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?

243
00:30:58,795 --> 00:30:59,955
Look at her run!

244
00:31:15,305 --> 00:31:20,645
You're such kung-fu masters,
go take it on the road.

245
00:31:20,815 --> 00:31:23,145
You belong in the circus, not here!

246
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:27,545
Don't say that, Landlady.
There must be a reason they're here.

247
00:31:27,855 --> 00:31:30,225
Everyone has his reasons.

248
00:31:30,395 --> 00:31:32,485
We don't want to make trouble.

249
00:31:32,665 --> 00:31:35,355
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.

250
00:31:35,535 --> 00:31:38,655
We'll never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!

251
00:31:39,735 --> 00:31:41,995
Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.

252
00:31:44,275 --> 00:31:46,105
You okay?

253
00:31:48,045 --> 00:31:49,565
Masters.

254
00:31:57,185 --> 00:31:59,175
We have nothing precious
to give you...

255
00:31:59,355 --> 00:32:01,685
...but take this as a token
of our appreciation.

256
00:32:02,555 --> 00:32:04,455
Thanks for saving us!

257
00:32:12,205 --> 00:32:15,195
Stop the crying. This isn't a show!

258
00:32:15,365 --> 00:32:18,935
- You're so cold-hearted.
- Talking back to me, eh?

259
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:21,905
You may know kung fu,
but you're still a fairy.

260
00:32:24,415 --> 00:32:27,315
It's no crime to be good at kung fu!

261
00:32:27,485 --> 00:32:30,245
Once a fairy, always a fairy.

262
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:33,945
Look at you. What's with
the red underwear?

263
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:36,615
Why not a diaper while you're at it.

264
00:32:37,895 --> 00:32:39,915
What's wrong with red underwear?

265
00:32:40,165 --> 00:32:42,995
Where were you
when there was trouble?

266
00:32:43,165 --> 00:32:47,125
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!

267
00:32:47,305 --> 00:32:48,795
I'll reason with you.

268
00:32:48,975 --> 00:32:52,235
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.

269
00:32:52,405 --> 00:32:54,675
Pay up or pack up!

270
00:32:54,845 --> 00:32:57,005
Don't you worry. I'll pay it.

271
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:59,665
Think you're a smartass,
Rabbit-Tooth Jane?

272
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:02,475
What's it to you, tub of lard?

273
00:33:02,655 --> 00:33:03,815
Bitch!

274
00:33:04,955 --> 00:33:06,615
Calm down, Landlady.

275
00:33:08,025 --> 00:33:10,085
This is your fault.

276
00:33:12,295 --> 00:33:14,595
- Are you trying to kill us?
- You're right.

277
00:33:14,765 --> 00:33:16,925
How could you do that?

278
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:19,035
Shut the hell up!

279
00:33:32,285 --> 00:33:34,515
You think you can out-yell me?

280
00:33:38,615 --> 00:33:41,385
The fat lady can really sing.

281
00:33:42,425 --> 00:33:43,915
Watch this!

282
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:00,065
What happened?

283
00:34:00,445 --> 00:34:03,375
What do you mean,
what happened? You try it.

284
00:34:03,545 --> 00:34:05,515
- Me?
- Quick!

285
00:34:11,355 --> 00:34:13,615
Sorry! You okay?

286
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,725
I think you should get closer
and take better aim. Okay?

287
00:34:17,895 --> 00:34:18,885
Okay!

288
00:34:31,105 --> 00:34:33,765
- Who's throwing the handles?
- Handle?

289
00:34:35,915 --> 00:34:37,875
Where's the third knife?

290
00:34:38,545 --> 00:34:40,985
God knows where it went.

291
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:43,615
Could it be the same one? Can't be...

292
00:34:43,785 --> 00:34:45,545
- Don't!
- Sorry.

293
00:34:47,725 --> 00:34:49,555
What are you trying to say?

294
00:34:49,725 --> 00:34:53,885
I just remembered I have
something to do. See you!

295
00:34:56,495 --> 00:34:58,555
Uh-oh. They've seen us!

296
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:01,505
Stay back!

297
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:14,175
Don't panic! Snakes like music.
If I whistle, they won't bite.

298
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:15,905
Please, no more bright ideas.

299
00:35:20,025 --> 00:35:21,485
Oh, what the hell!

300
00:35:28,265 --> 00:35:29,825
Not you again, asshole!

301
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:33,365
Get back to your business!

302
00:35:35,205 --> 00:35:36,695
Split up!

303
00:35:38,975 --> 00:35:40,135
Split?

304
00:37:53,075 --> 00:37:54,405
What're you doing here?

305
00:37:54,575 --> 00:37:56,735
Looking for you. Weren't you hurt?

306
00:37:56,915 --> 00:37:58,105
I'm fine!

307
00:38:00,185 --> 00:38:03,085
How come you always recover so fast?

308
00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:04,905
I don't know.

309
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:07,915
- Which hospital did you go to?
- Don't remember.

310
00:38:08,685 --> 00:38:10,315
Maybe it's better that way.

311
00:38:10,495 --> 00:38:15,195
Memories can be painful.
To forget may be a blessing!

312
00:38:15,365 --> 00:38:18,195
I never knew you were so deep.

313
00:38:19,435 --> 00:38:21,925
All the sadness one can bear...

314
00:38:29,915 --> 00:38:33,175
...down the river everywhere.

315
00:38:35,485 --> 00:38:37,075
Hey, get out of the way!

316
00:38:37,255 --> 00:38:38,515
Move!

317
00:38:38,685 --> 00:38:40,345
I'll slap you to kingdom come!

318
00:38:40,725 --> 00:38:44,555
Look at those four-eyes
carting around a coffin.

319
00:38:46,395 --> 00:38:47,885
What morons!

320
00:38:50,095 --> 00:38:52,255
Don't blame me for making you leave.

321
00:38:52,435 --> 00:38:56,495
We'll let Buddha decide...

322
00:38:56,975 --> 00:38:59,375
...whether you stay...

323
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,975
...or go.

324
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:07,875
HORRIFICALLY BAD FATE

325
00:39:19,865 --> 00:39:21,625
Have some tea.

326
00:39:28,905 --> 00:39:31,965
We're grateful for
some professional help.

327
00:39:32,135 --> 00:39:35,805
We understand the problem.
Twelve Kicks from the Tam School...

328
00:39:35,975 --> 00:39:40,975
...Iron Fist from the Hung School
and the Hexagon Staff...

329
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,535
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.

330
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,985
Their warrior days are long over...

331
00:39:46,485 --> 00:39:49,925
...but they're still top fighters.

332
00:39:50,325 --> 00:39:55,155
This job is a great challenge for us.

333
00:39:55,495 --> 00:39:58,025
Now, that's professionalism.

334
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:03,535
Number One Killers. Expensive, yes,
but worth every penny!

335
00:40:03,705 --> 00:40:04,695
No!

336
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:09,935
Number one is the Beast,
the world's top killer.

337
00:40:10,415 --> 00:40:14,715
He was so dedicated to kung fu,
he went crazy.

338
00:40:14,885 --> 00:40:18,185
I heard he's now in an asylum.

339
00:40:18,785 --> 00:40:22,085
So you're the top killers now.

340
00:40:22,255 --> 00:40:26,625
Strictly speaking,
we're just musicians.

341
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:31,695
{\i1}A song that wrenches the heart{\i0}
{\i1}O where do I find a knowing ear? {\i0}

342
00:40:31,965 --> 00:40:36,365
Great poem, isn't it?

343
00:40:44,445 --> 00:40:45,965
We'll be saying goodbye soon.

344
00:40:46,145 --> 00:40:48,635
Who knows when we'll see
each other again.

345
00:40:49,385 --> 00:40:53,585
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.

346
00:40:53,755 --> 00:40:57,055
Let's take this opportunity
to spar a little.

347
00:40:57,295 --> 00:41:00,655
No. We still have a lot to pack.

348
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,155
You're right.

349
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:44,605
Twelve Kicks of the Tam School!
Superb attack and defense!

350
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:47,635
Iron Fist: powerful yet delicate.
Topnotch!

351
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:51,105
Hexagon Staff, with its
thousand moves. Mystical!

352
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:53,915
Till we meet again!

353
00:42:03,595 --> 00:42:04,575
More lipstick!

354
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:26,965
Stay there, or I'll break you in half.

355
00:43:50,895 --> 00:43:52,955
Sorry, we're closed.

356
00:43:53,135 --> 00:43:55,155
You can make a suit in no time.

357
00:43:55,335 --> 00:43:56,825
We're moving.

358
00:43:57,005 --> 00:43:58,835
This is good material!

359
00:43:59,505 --> 00:44:01,835
You know your stuff.

360
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:04,535
This has high artistic value.

361
00:44:05,145 --> 00:44:06,475
How high?

362
00:44:06,915 --> 00:44:08,745
At least a few stories...

363
00:45:18,755 --> 00:45:20,985
Insulting the Axe Gang!
We'll show them.

364
00:45:21,155 --> 00:45:24,315
Let's kill them all and make
this place a brothel.

365
00:45:24,495 --> 00:45:26,485
Don't block my view!

366
00:46:16,045 --> 00:46:17,035
What's going on?

367
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:29,615
Good!

368
00:46:29,795 --> 00:46:31,625
Don't block my view!

369
00:46:36,795 --> 00:46:39,965
Damn! I told those nitwits to leave,
but they're still here.

370
00:46:40,135 --> 00:46:41,865
- Really?
- Yeah.

371
00:47:05,425 --> 00:47:09,415
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?

372
00:47:09,595 --> 00:47:11,585
Sorry, sorry. It's nothing!

373
00:48:52,265 --> 00:48:55,325
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.

374
00:48:56,465 --> 00:48:58,365
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!

375
00:48:59,275 --> 00:49:00,765
Die? In this racket?

376
00:49:00,945 --> 00:49:02,965
Sorry, sorry!

377
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,265
Get out of my way!

378
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:09,775
Hang in there, Tailor.

379
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:20,885
Be quiet!

380
00:49:26,135 --> 00:49:30,865
Give us a break! Why push us so far?

381
00:49:45,555 --> 00:49:46,745
There's another master?

382
00:52:13,865 --> 00:52:15,855
It's the Lion's Roar!

383
00:52:16,535 --> 00:52:18,365
I thought that was a myth.

384
00:52:19,575 --> 00:52:22,545
Who knew the Lion's Roar
really exists?

385
00:52:22,705 --> 00:52:26,305
That's the last we'll see of them.

386
00:52:29,485 --> 00:52:31,815
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!

387
00:52:32,185 --> 00:52:33,815
Start the car!

388
00:52:40,565 --> 00:52:41,725
Boss!

389
00:52:41,895 --> 00:52:44,155
Keep it down! Have you no manners?

390
00:52:44,335 --> 00:52:46,735
Get lost. People are trying to sleep.

391
00:52:46,905 --> 00:52:49,865
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!

392
00:52:53,105 --> 00:52:54,735
Scumbags!

393
00:54:20,595 --> 00:54:23,615
I can't hang on much longer.

394
00:54:25,995 --> 00:54:29,865
But having seen
real masters like you...

395
00:54:30,605 --> 00:54:32,665
...I can now die in peace.

396
00:54:32,835 --> 00:54:34,775
Don't say that.

397
00:54:34,945 --> 00:54:37,875
We're ordinary folks.

398
00:54:38,045 --> 00:54:39,805
Ordinary's a blessing.

399
00:54:39,975 --> 00:54:43,435
Don't call us masters.

400
00:54:43,615 --> 00:54:45,515
But you're such great fighters!

401
00:54:45,685 --> 00:54:49,955
If only you'd helped earlier,
they wouldn't have to die this way.

402
00:54:50,455 --> 00:54:54,625
Like Donut said,
everyone has his reasons.

403
00:54:55,395 --> 00:54:57,125
Years ago...

404
00:54:57,635 --> 00:55:00,725
...we saw our only son killed in a fight.

405
00:55:03,005 --> 00:55:05,665
Revenge can be devastating.

406
00:55:06,035 --> 00:55:08,205
Do you understand?

407
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:11,465
Why don't you train us
to be top fighters...

408
00:55:11,645 --> 00:55:14,635
...and we'll avenge them!

409
00:55:14,985 --> 00:55:18,975
Becoming a top fighter takes time.

410
00:55:19,155 --> 00:55:21,715
Unless you're a natural-born
kung-fu genius.

411
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:25,655
And they're one in a million.

412
00:55:33,235 --> 00:55:35,425
It's obvious I'm the one!

413
00:55:39,005 --> 00:55:41,205
Don't think so.

414
00:55:42,175 --> 00:55:47,545
Everyone! We swore
we'd never fight again.

415
00:55:47,715 --> 00:55:50,115
But we broke that promise today.

416
00:55:50,285 --> 00:55:53,845
For your own safety, please all leave!

417
00:55:58,295 --> 00:56:01,855
In great power lies great responsibility.

418
00:56:02,365 --> 00:56:04,225
There's no escaping from it.

419
00:56:04,635 --> 00:56:07,195
Donut, you're hurt bad.

420
00:56:07,365 --> 00:56:08,925
Rest now.

421
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:16,305
We can't understand
what you're saying.

422
00:56:17,945 --> 00:56:19,035
Donut!

423
00:56:32,095 --> 00:56:34,085
I know you, four-eyes!

424
00:56:35,495 --> 00:56:40,095
You seem prejudiced against
the sight-challenged.

425
00:56:40,265 --> 00:56:43,565
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.

426
00:56:47,805 --> 00:56:51,145
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.

427
00:56:51,315 --> 00:56:54,405
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?

428
00:56:56,785 --> 00:56:57,775
Help me!

429
00:57:00,115 --> 00:57:03,355
"Help me! Help me!"
Want to play, punks?

430
00:57:03,525 --> 00:57:05,355
The Dragon Style? The Tiger Style?

431
00:57:10,095 --> 00:57:14,535
Come down here, and I'll smash
your glasses. Come on!

432
00:57:16,205 --> 00:57:18,435
You know I'd do it, right?

433
00:57:19,775 --> 00:57:21,105
Swear to it!

434
00:57:21,705 --> 00:57:23,035
Swear!

435
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:30,175
Have you no respect? Where were you
when I needed you?

436
00:57:31,955 --> 00:57:33,645
You sound like a wimp!

437
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:36,985
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.

438
00:57:37,155 --> 00:57:40,885
No killing, no arson,
no robberies, no rapes...

439
00:57:41,065 --> 00:57:43,625
...all because of you!

440
00:57:43,795 --> 00:57:46,125
You're a numb-nut!

441
00:57:48,535 --> 00:57:49,865
Follow me!

442
00:57:58,545 --> 00:58:00,175
It's a stickup! Where's the money?

443
00:58:05,085 --> 00:58:07,275
Where's the money?

444
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:11,015
What're you looking at? I'm serious!

445
00:58:15,965 --> 00:58:19,955
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.

446
00:58:38,385 --> 00:58:40,045
The money's in here.

447
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:17,815
Let go of the girl!

448
00:59:30,835 --> 00:59:35,505
He's a fool, and she's mute. Losers!

449
01:00:18,985 --> 01:00:22,385
Go away! You're dragging me down!

450
01:00:23,155 --> 01:00:28,255
Go home and raise pigs.

451
01:00:33,165 --> 01:00:34,655
Go, before I kill you.

452
01:01:23,485 --> 01:01:26,885
You! Whatsyourname!

453
01:01:35,965 --> 01:01:39,395
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!

454
01:01:39,565 --> 01:01:43,395
- For real?
- Someone's waiting for you.

455
01:01:50,305 --> 01:01:51,465
Brother Sum!

456
01:01:51,645 --> 01:01:56,135
One look at you, and I knew
you'd do anything.

457
01:01:56,445 --> 01:01:57,435
Right!

458
01:01:57,615 --> 01:01:59,415
You just needed your chance.

459
01:02:00,185 --> 01:02:01,245
Damn right!

460
01:02:01,425 --> 01:02:03,085
We've an assignment for you.

461
01:02:03,255 --> 01:02:04,815
Anything, Brother Sum!

462
01:02:23,675 --> 01:02:26,665
"Research on abnormal people."
What's that?

463
01:02:26,845 --> 01:02:28,645
A mental asylum.

464
01:02:34,385 --> 01:02:35,615
Soldiers!

465
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:37,515
Boy Scouts!

466
01:02:37,695 --> 01:02:38,675
Tanks!

467
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:40,825
No worries.

468
01:02:40,995 --> 01:02:44,625
When the Boy Scouts change shifts,
you have exactly five minutes.

469
01:02:44,795 --> 01:02:48,735
Follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the last cell...

470
01:02:48,905 --> 01:02:53,565
...and get the man inside there out.
Here's your tools.

471
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:00,965
What about you guys?

472
01:03:01,145 --> 01:03:03,135
We're your lookouts.

473
01:03:14,495 --> 01:03:16,485
Five minutes. Hurry!

474
01:05:30,795 --> 01:05:35,635
The world's top killer
indeed looks the part!

475
01:05:36,665 --> 01:05:39,005
It's only a title.

476
01:05:39,175 --> 01:05:42,625
Cut the bullshit. We want two people
killed. Name your price.

477
01:05:43,175 --> 01:05:44,695
Name my what?

478
01:05:47,075 --> 01:05:52,345
I've killed so many trying to find
a worthy adversary.

479
01:05:52,685 --> 01:05:55,985
So far, I've never found one.

480
01:05:56,325 --> 01:05:58,155
That's why I stayed inside.

481
01:05:58,325 --> 01:06:02,725
Had I met my match,
I'd have been out long ago.

482
01:06:02,895 --> 01:06:05,365
If you find me a worthy opponent...

483
01:06:05,535 --> 01:06:07,825
...I'll do it for free. No charge!

484
01:06:10,005 --> 01:06:11,165
Do you have someone?

485
01:06:11,335 --> 01:06:16,575
Yes. Brilliant fighters who are
up to the challenge.

486
01:06:16,745 --> 01:06:19,075
But first, will you show us
some moves?

487
01:06:19,245 --> 01:06:22,305
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.

488
01:06:22,685 --> 01:06:26,945
You numskulls aren't worthy!

489
01:06:31,455 --> 01:06:33,115
He doesn't look the part.

490
01:06:34,025 --> 01:06:39,225
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'll clean up well.

491
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:41,295
You sure you got the right guy?

492
01:06:41,465 --> 01:06:44,805
Absolutely. I swear I did
exactly what you told me.

493
01:06:46,105 --> 01:06:50,065
Please show us some moves,
Mr. Beast. Don't make it hard for me!

494
01:06:50,245 --> 01:06:51,865
You dumb or what?

495
01:06:52,715 --> 01:06:54,705
You know what this is, old man?

496
01:06:55,145 --> 01:06:57,585
Ever seen a fist this big?

497
01:06:57,755 --> 01:07:00,875
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!

498
01:07:01,055 --> 01:07:02,985
Really? Try me, then.

499
01:07:06,825 --> 01:07:08,985
Is he okay?

500
01:07:14,765 --> 01:07:17,325
So you say you can fight?

501
01:07:18,735 --> 01:07:19,725
Harder!

502
01:07:20,605 --> 01:07:21,595
Harder!

503
01:07:24,845 --> 01:07:26,175
Harder!

504
01:07:29,085 --> 01:07:32,575
You hit like that and call yourself
a gangster?

505
01:07:37,555 --> 01:07:38,855
A foreign gun!

506
01:08:04,515 --> 01:08:09,855
In the world of kung fu,
speed defines the winner.

507
01:08:13,955 --> 01:08:16,865
The Beast is the best of them all.

508
01:08:17,125 --> 01:08:20,795
The Axe Gang extends its respect!

509
01:09:02,575 --> 01:09:05,445
The real masters,
together in one room!

510
01:09:06,545 --> 01:09:10,745
Only the world's top killer...

511
01:09:10,915 --> 01:09:13,115
...has such an aura.

512
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:15,085
Likewise.

513
01:09:15,685 --> 01:09:18,345
Could you two be the fated lovers...?

514
01:09:18,525 --> 01:09:19,515
Paris...

515
01:09:19,695 --> 01:09:20,785
...and Helen of Troy!

516
01:09:21,595 --> 01:09:23,255
A pleasure, indeed.

517
01:09:23,525 --> 01:09:27,365
We're here to deal
with the Axe Gang...

518
01:09:27,535 --> 01:09:29,265
...and only the Axe Gang.

519
01:09:31,205 --> 01:09:34,035
You should've killed me before.

520
01:09:34,375 --> 01:09:38,815
Now you're committing suicide.

521
01:09:38,975 --> 01:09:42,315
You're living on borrowed time.

522
01:09:42,485 --> 01:09:45,475
You can't escape your fate!

523
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:48,555
What's this? A funeral bell?

524
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:52,725
With the Beast here,
let's see whose funeral it is!

525
01:09:53,555 --> 01:09:55,285
So you're on their side?

526
01:09:55,465 --> 01:09:57,625
Don't get me wrong.

527
01:09:57,795 --> 01:10:01,395
I only want to kill you...

528
01:10:01,565 --> 01:10:04,465
...or be killed by you.

529
01:10:06,975 --> 01:10:08,945
What do you think?

530
01:10:09,105 --> 01:10:14,445
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.

531
01:10:15,085 --> 01:10:18,415
So be it. Let's do it.

532
01:10:19,415 --> 01:10:20,575
Okay.

533
01:10:22,125 --> 01:10:23,145
Let's do it!

534
01:10:43,275 --> 01:10:45,675
Piece of cake. I can handle this.

535
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:57,985
Good try, but a little off target.

536
01:12:17,765 --> 01:12:19,435
The Lion's Roar?

537
01:15:00,295 --> 01:15:01,525
Wait!

538
01:15:02,705 --> 01:15:07,535
I didn't know the Lion's Roar
could be done with a speaker!

539
01:15:07,705 --> 01:15:10,035
What a blow!

540
01:15:39,335 --> 01:15:42,675
- Looks like they're not up to it!
- Let's get them while they're down.

541
01:15:42,845 --> 01:15:43,835
You do it!

542
01:15:44,005 --> 01:15:47,005
- I'm gonna puke! I need to see a doctor!
- Go to hell!

543
01:15:51,445 --> 01:15:53,245
You! Come over here.

544
01:15:54,255 --> 01:15:56,415
- Hit him!
- Yes!

545
01:16:00,855 --> 01:16:02,755
- The head!
- Of course!

546
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:04,655
- Hit him on the head!
- Okay.

547
01:16:04,835 --> 01:16:06,625
- Here's your chance.
- Got it!

548
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:07,925
- Hit him!
- Hit him!

549
01:16:08,095 --> 01:16:09,585
- Hit the shit out of him!
- Right!

550
01:16:09,765 --> 01:16:11,035
- Hit him!
- Hit him!

551
01:16:11,205 --> 01:16:12,965
Beat the shit out of him!

552
01:16:15,045 --> 01:16:16,025
What're you doing?

553
01:16:16,775 --> 01:16:19,715
You want me to hit him
or beat the shit out of him?

554
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:21,815
You're making me very confused!

555
01:16:50,145 --> 01:16:53,135
Wow, that's a big fist!

556
01:17:25,715 --> 01:17:27,105
Why did you hit me?

557
01:17:56,045 --> 01:17:59,375
Where are they?

558
01:17:59,715 --> 01:18:01,875
How could you let them escape?

559
01:18:07,985 --> 01:18:11,975
No one gets away from me!

560
01:18:25,635 --> 01:18:27,835
Why did he save us?

561
01:18:28,005 --> 01:18:31,105
Young people make mistakes.

562
01:18:31,445 --> 01:18:35,205
But at least he finally made good.

563
01:18:35,785 --> 01:18:39,475
Look at him! Beaten to a pulp.

564
01:18:42,225 --> 01:18:45,515
Do you have any last requests?

565
01:19:04,805 --> 01:19:07,715
Hey, wait!

566
01:19:08,075 --> 01:19:11,915
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.

567
01:20:08,275 --> 01:20:10,295
There's no one here!

568
01:20:15,085 --> 01:20:17,705
CHINESE MEDICINE

569
01:20:31,395 --> 01:20:34,385
It's a miracle he lasted this long.

570
01:20:35,065 --> 01:20:37,335
The herbs should help him.

571
01:20:37,565 --> 01:20:41,975
Herbal medicine can only partly help.
The key is his own body structure.

572
01:20:42,145 --> 01:20:46,475
All his bones and tendons are broken.

573
01:20:46,645 --> 01:20:49,575
It's amazing he's recovering so fast.

574
01:20:50,085 --> 01:20:52,245
It can't be possible...

575
01:20:52,415 --> 01:20:53,975
Unless he's...

576
01:21:31,325 --> 01:21:32,845
What's that smell?

577
01:22:06,855 --> 01:22:08,845
You mustn't smoke while you're hurt.

578
01:22:10,325 --> 01:22:11,815
Let me handle this.

579
01:22:26,615 --> 01:22:28,075
This makes no sense.

580
01:22:39,725 --> 01:22:43,785
Who knew the Beast could clear
the chi flow...

581
01:22:43,965 --> 01:22:46,525
...and thus unleash
the boy's true potential?

582
01:22:46,735 --> 01:22:49,635
We should've guessed.

583
01:22:50,865 --> 01:22:54,265
He is the one!

584
01:23:04,715 --> 01:23:06,655
Is this for real?

585
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:09,375
You're still alive, you turncoat?

586
01:23:09,555 --> 01:23:11,955
Kill him, men!

587
01:24:06,815 --> 01:24:08,275
What kind of move is that?

588
01:24:08,615 --> 01:24:11,135
Kids' stuff!

589
01:24:39,045 --> 01:24:42,635
If our son were alive,
he'd be his age now.

590
01:24:42,815 --> 01:24:48,155
If he studies hard, he could grow up
to be a doctor or lawyer.

591
01:24:48,315 --> 01:24:51,155
A stuntman, more likely!

592
01:25:54,315 --> 01:25:55,875
Not bad. Let's go.

593
01:26:38,935 --> 01:26:40,985
I can even stop bullets...

594
01:27:51,365 --> 01:27:54,735
What? The Toad Style
of the Kwan Lun School?

595
01:27:54,905 --> 01:27:56,105
Oh, no!

596
01:29:51,685 --> 01:29:55,625
Remember the Palm move
that falls from heaven?

597
01:29:55,795 --> 01:29:58,955
That's the long lost Buddhist Palm.

598
01:30:43,275 --> 01:30:44,605
I surrender!

599
01:31:46,135 --> 01:31:47,575
What kind of move was that?

600
01:31:49,345 --> 01:31:51,505
If you want to learn, I'll teach you.

601
01:32:03,255 --> 01:32:04,585
Master!

602
01:33:18,425 --> 01:33:22,265
Hey! Tell him not to put snot
on the glass.

603
01:33:22,435 --> 01:33:25,025
You two, put your pants on!

604
01:33:25,205 --> 01:33:27,865
No licking if you're not buying!

605
01:34:34,235 --> 01:34:38,835
Kid, you have the bone structure
of a kung-fu genius.

606
01:34:39,005 --> 01:34:42,805
World peace is in your hands.
Here's the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.

607
01:34:42,985 --> 01:34:45,575
Because it's fate, I'll let you
have it for $ 10.

608
01:34:45,745 --> 01:34:46,805
Wait!

609
01:34:47,255 --> 01:34:49,655
You want more...?
