1
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,277
What is the meaning of this check?
Do you want me to cheat?

2
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,404
No. I'm just the middleman.

3
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,614
Are you playing a joke on me,
or trying to cause trouble?

4
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,285
Do you think you can
replace me if I fail?

5
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,620
Look at this!

6
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,707
I'm the only Golden Leg!

7
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,501
- Make sure you remember that.
- It's not that.

8
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:53,005
I just want a kickback.
Please don't tell anybody.

9
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,299
You're trash!

10
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,759
I'm sorry. Catch you later.

11
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,578
Golden Leg! Golden Leg!

12
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:35,232
You've been number one ever since
Fung got his golden leg broken.

13
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,235
First as a player, then as a coach.

14
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,195
I'm better than Fung ever was.

15
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,073
Team Evil has won the Supercup
the last five years.

16
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,575
- What's your secret?
- Secret?

17
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,411
They just have the best coach.

18
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,371
So you're confident
that your team will win again?

19
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,165
Are you new?
Don't ask stupid questions.

20
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:58,547
Good morning.

21
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,342
Golden Leg.

22
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,637
Hung! Good morning.

23
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:11,101
Hung, your shoe's dirty.
Let me clean it for you.

24
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,395
It's okay. I'll do it.

25
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,821
Hung, I'll get the car.

26
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,907
Hung, you said if I worked hard
I could coach my own team.

27
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,451
I'm ready!

28
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,912
I think I can train a team
to be as good as Team Evil.

29
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,791
Do you really think
I'd let you coach?

30
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,335
But you said-

31
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,086
Get real.

32
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,464
You're a joke.

33
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,216
Take a look at yourself.

34
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,720
This tattoo is all that's left
of your fame.

35
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,430
Hung...

36
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,475
I've served you for 20 years.
How can you say that?

37
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,978
Let's be honest.
Things have changed.

38
00:05:55,104 --> 00:06:00,108
You used to be a great player,
but now you're nothing.

39
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,860
I've had enough.

40
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,029
I've kept you around for 20 years...

41
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,698
but it's time for you
to take care of yourself.

42
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,408
Hung!

43
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,410
You've got a lot of nerve.

44
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,996
If you hadn't tricked me
with a bad check 20 years ago...

45
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,165
you'd be working for me right now.

46
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,376
It was your idea to throw the game.

47
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,044
Are you throwing a tantrum?

48
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,630
Say it a bit louder.
Did you guys hear that?

49
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,758
Make sure the reporters can hear it.

50
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:29,346
Say what you want.
Take a look at yourself.

51
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,516
Do you think anyone would believe
a crippled has-been like you?

52
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,559
- You-
- Don't be angry.

53
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:37,479
If you want to blame anyone,
blame yourself.

54
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,564
Blame your own greediness.

55
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,358
Get lost.

56
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,279
One more thing...

57
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,574
I hired that mob to break your leg.

58
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,651
Yuppies.

59
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,751
They're not very skilled
at playing soccer.

60
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,893
What was that?

61
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,273
I said...

62
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,400
they're not very skilled
at playing soccer.

63
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,490
You think you can do better?

64
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:15,744
There must be a fusion
of mind and foot.

65
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:20,040
What kind of fusion?

66
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:38,391
My late idol, Master Bruce Lee...

67
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,437
invented the ultimate kick.

68
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:46,483
If you want to learn about it,
I'll give you kung fu lessons.

69
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:50,904
Kung fu lessons?
You look like a janitor.

70
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,491
My job as janitor is only temporary.

71
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,118
I'm a postgraduate student.

72
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,120
Postgraduate student?

73
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,332
I'm trying to develop
an effective method...

74
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,918
of promoting Shaolin kung fu.

75
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,045
Here's my card.

76
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:13,385
Authentic Shaolin school.
Mighty Steel Leg.

77
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,428
Look! I know what I'm talking about.

78
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,015
I don't need kung fu.

79
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:22,102
I'm more of an intellectual.

80
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,812
It doesn't matter.

81
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,692
Look at this woman.

82
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:34,322
Yeah, she's sexy. So what?

83
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,574
No.

84
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,492
Watch this!

85
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,675
If she knew Shaolin kung fu...

86
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,803
she wouldn't have fallen.
Get me?

87
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,188
Shaolin kung fu
can work for everyone!

88
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,900
Excuse me!
Do you want to learn kung fu?

89
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,861
Are you crazy?

90
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,073
Look over there.

91
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:21,202
If she had studied Shaolin Iron Hand
parking would be much easier.

92
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,501
Kung fu is wonderful.

93
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,505
- Excuse me, do you want to learn-
- Here. Get lost.

94
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,092
Hey, you should share that with me.

95
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:39,554
Let's not fight. See that guy?

96
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,350
What are you doing?
You're way too slow.

97
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,976
That's it! You're fired!

98
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,103
- I'm sorry.
- Get lost!

99
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,898
If he knew Shaolin Flying Sword...

100
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,192
he'd still have a job!

101
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:57,113
You think Shaolin
is the answer to everything.

102
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:00,075
There is nothing more powerful.
All kung fu derives from it.

103
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,431
People have the wrong idea
about kung fu.

104
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,226
It isn't really about fighting.

105
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:30,188
Kung fu is a complete way of life.

106
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:34,067
I'm looking for a good way
to show people...

107
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:38,363
how it can make their lives better.

108
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,157
- Enough already!
- But-

109
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:45,578
I have important things to do.
I've heard enough.

110
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:49,374
Please seize this opportunity!
Cripples can still learn kung fu.

111
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,626
Who are you calling a cripple!

112
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,838
This leg has kicked hundreds of goals.

113
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:55,922
I'm sorry!

114
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,007
Do you know who you're talking to?

115
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,093
I'm the famous Golden Leg.

116
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,678
You're...

117
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,472
just a bum!

118
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:20,071
- You think I'm impressed?
- Get these cans out of here.

119
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,323
- Okay.
- Right away.

120
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,993
Cheap trick.

121
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,400
Get lost.

122
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,759
Excuse me!
Can you help me move this?

123
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,219
No problem!

124
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,393
Your leg's amazing!

125
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,024
Twenty cents!

126
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,944
Only twenty cents?
How about an advance?

127
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,238
No way! Get lost.

128
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,282
SWEET BUNS

129
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,950
Mui, ten steamed buns please!

130
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:48,988
Using Tai Chi kung fu to make
steamed buns is a brilliant idea

131
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:54,452
They look so sweet and tasty

132
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:58,039
Your mastery is astonishing

133
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:02,961
It shows in your every movement

134
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,132
What are you doing?

135
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:13,846
Singing is the best way for me
to express my greatest esteem.

136
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,558
Wow, what a beauty!

137
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,355
I'm not beautiful.
Don't laugh at me!

138
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,816
I bet the steamed buns are wonderful.

139
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,822
Delicious!

140
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,741
Was that Shifting Bodies
and Transposing Shadows?

141
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:37,662
No, it's Shove A Thousand Cattle
with Four Tails.

142
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,580
Right!

143
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,875
That's why the buns
are so tender, yet firm.

144
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,754
Sixty cents each.
Two for a dollar.

145
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,216
That much?

146
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,677
They're worth every penny.

147
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,013
This is all I have.

148
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,515
- Can I pay tomorrow?
- No!

149
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:01,144
Spoken with the grace and economy
of a true kung fu master.

150
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,854
I'm a Shaolin master too.

151
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,148
- Can I pay tomorrow?
- No!

152
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,524
Okay!

153
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,321
Here are some fine sneakers.

154
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,908
I'll give them to you,
if you let me have one more bun.

155
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,036
- I'll call the cops.
- Fine.

156
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,039
Come on, give me a break.

157
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,791
You're so beautiful.

158
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,086
Shut up!

159
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,297
Please stop singing.

160
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,340
Just pay and get out of here.

161
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,551
If you want to sing,
do it on the mountain.

162
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,678
Only crazy people sing here.

163
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,806
I disagree with the young lady.

164
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:44,562
Just because you sing out loud here
doesn't make you a lunatic.

165
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,273
My name is Dynamite.

166
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,778
My dream is to become
a great composer one day.

167
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:58,117
This gentleman's song
is very creative and sincere.

168
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,703
- Thank you!
- You're welcome!

169
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:04,123
I also love to sing.

170
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,419
When I'm inspired
I feel so passionate...

171
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,546
I could explode.

172
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:31,317
My dream is to become
a great choreographer.

173
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,340
Let's go!

174
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,962
Have you lost your mind?

175
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:39,010
Stand straight! Put your hands down!
Get to work!

176
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,469
Lunatics!

177
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,431
What's going on here?

178
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,728
I never should have gone
for a facial...

179
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,856
and left the place in your hands!

180
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,941
What do you want?

181
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,444
Relax. We were just having fun.

182
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,113
I'm here for the buns.

183
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,618
What about my buns?

184
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:07,121
Okay! Okay! Just a minute!
Did that bum pay?

185
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,501
He did.

186
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,297
These are disgusting.
Get rid of them!

187
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:38,819
First Brother!

188
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:44,075
Okay, okay. Keep working!
Clean everything!

189
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,788
Are you sick, First Brother?

190
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,708
I've got a bit of a hangover.
What do you want?

191
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:56,545
- I've had a revelation.
- A revelation?

192
00:20:56,672 --> 00:21:02,343
How to promote kung fu
in a brand new way.

193
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,469
Not again.

194
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,014
Singing!

195
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,352
You know we're great singers.
You can't deny it.

196
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:16,357
- Leave me alone.
- We owe it to our teacher.

197
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,275
He's dead.

198
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,402
- It's worth a try.
- Forget it.

199
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,154
I told you to be down-to-earth.

200
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,074
There's an opening here.
You can clean toilets.

201
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,118
Don't waste your life
chasing dreams.

202
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,371
Without dreams,
we're no different than anchovies.

203
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:33,499
You are an anchovy,
you shoeless small fry.

204
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,627
- Why chase your dream?
- Why not.

205
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,755
The fire in my heart
can't be easily extinguished.

206
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,800
Why not? Just blow it out.

207
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,928
- But I can light it up again.
- Enough already!

208
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,264
We both have our own lives.

209
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:52,018
Please don't bother me.
I have to work to support my family.

210
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:57,648
You're just going to forget about
your Iron Head after all that work?

211
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,358
Never!

212
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,611
I still practice my Iron Head...

213
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,031
every single day!

214
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,490
Fei!

215
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,908
Boss.

216
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,452
You idiot!

217
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,955
You forgot to book
a band for tonight.

218
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:16,500
- Don't worry, I have an idea.
- Tell me.

219
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:19,962
Let's combine Shaolin kung fu
with singing and dancing.

220
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,548
- What kind of Shaolin kung fu?
- Observe.

221
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:28,471
Is he good enough
to perform on stage?

222
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,682
- He's good enough.
- How about you?

223
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,309
Me?

224
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,811
Shit.

225
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,813
How about your Iron Head?

226
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:41,650
If you don't perform well,
I'll kill you tomorrow.

227
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,570
- Sure.
- First Big Brother, thank you.

228
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:01,545
- Shaolin kung fu is great
- Really great

229
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:06,133
- Shaolin kung fu is wonderful
- Wonderful

230
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:10,513
- I'm Iron Head
- Iron Head

231
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:15,434
- He's Mighty Steel Leg
- Mighty Steel Leg

232
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,524
Be serious!

233
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:35,746
- Shaolin kung fu is great
- Really great

234
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:40,418
- Shaolin kung fu is wonderful
- Wonderful

235
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:44,380
- I'm Mighty Steel Leg
- Mighty Steel Leg

236
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,924
He's Iron Head

237
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,846
I'm choking.

238
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,047
It sounds like you're
strangling a cat.

239
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,549
This song sucks.

240
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,217
You sounded like a dying animal.

241
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,886
Who wrote that garbage?

242
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,013
- Yeah, who?
- Who?

243
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:43,314
Creative work is highly subjective,
so I'll accept your criticism.

244
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,025
But it's only
the beginning of the show.

245
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:49,778
Wait until we show you why we're called
Mighty Steel Leg and Iron Head.

246
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:50,696
Iron Head?

247
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,948
I told you the lyrics
were too intellectual.

248
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:56,535
- I'm not Iron Head. He's-
- Iron Head?

249
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:01,749
- Mighty Steel Leg!
- He's Mighty Steel Leg!

250
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,709
That's your Mighty Steel Leg?

251
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,213
- I'll kill you.
- Mighty Steel Leg.

252
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,716
I'm the real Mighty Steel Leg.

253
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:14,136
- Iron Head.
- Don't you understand?

254
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,055
- He's the real-
- Iron Head.

255
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,723
You're so stubborn.

256
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,602
Do you want to fight
with a customer?

257
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:28,400
Thank you so much.
Happy hour went by fast.

258
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,237
It's time for us to say
good night right now.

259
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,156
Let's listen to some music.

260
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,534
You crazy guy.

261
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:43,415
- Let's see how much you can take.
- Thank you.

262
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,853
You're a bum.

263
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,418
Come on. Nothing to see.

264
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:56,090
You want some more?
Sure you want to fight us all?

265
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:01,470
I promised my master
I'd never fight.

266
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:04,765
I told you he'd wimp out!

267
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:07,393
But I expect an apology!

268
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:11,397
An apology?
You should apologize to us!

269
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:33,168
You said you wouldn't use
kung fu to fight.

270
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:46,014
I'm not here to fight.
I'm here to play soccer.

271
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,607
So much for your kung fu-

272
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:03,615
Don't be such a baby. What?

273
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,737
I give up. I apologize!

274
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,048
Do you have any change?

275
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,509
Yes.

276
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,721
Thirty cents.

277
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,557
- Are you stealing my money?
- Yes.

278
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,851
- Was that Praying Mantis Style?
- Yes.

279
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,187
You should learn Shaolin instead.

280
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:47,678
Can I see your leg?

281
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:51,181
I don't care.
Do what you want.

282
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,695
It's the real deal.

283
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,954
It looks like an ordinary leg.

284
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,249
It's Shaolin Mighty Steel Leg.
It's patented.

285
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,962
You could use your kung fu
to play soccer.

286
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,757
You think so?

287
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,259
Yes, why not.

288
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,678
Of course.

289
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,140
That's a great idea. Kung fu soccer.

290
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:36,935
Why didn't I think of that?
How do I go about it?

291
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:39,688
You'll need my help.

292
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,107
I'm Golden Leg, the soccer star.

293
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,276
Now I'm a coach.

294
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,029
- Great! You can teach me soccer.
- I don't know.

295
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,072
It's a great idea.

296
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:52,534
I'll think about it!

297
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,872
There's nothing to think about.
We should start right now!

298
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,334
We've got nothing to lose.

299
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,924
It takes a lot of training.

300
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,509
Let's do it! What do I need?

301
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,471
A pair of shoes.

302
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,520
Do you have the money for the buns?

303
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,148
- No, but-
- I threw them out.

304
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,566
Oh, my God!

305
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:28,195
Those sneakers were a mess.
They were all worn out.

306
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,738
I know, I know.

307
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:34,409
If my boss sees you,
she'll start yelling.

308
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:46,546
I couldn't bring myself to toss them.
I fixed them instead.

309
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:15,242
First Brother, what's wrong?
Are you okay?

310
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,079
I'm fine.

311
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,290
What do you want?

312
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,752
I finally found a great way
to promote Shaolin kung fu.

313
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,256
Soccer!

314
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,135
Please leave me alone!

315
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:36,096
You got me into a lot of trouble.
They demoted me.

316
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,682
Now I have to clean the toilets.

317
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:42,894
- But we'd be great.
- No! Absolutely not!

318
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:46,690
If you humiliate me again, my family
will commit suicide in front of you.

319
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,359
Committing suicide
is not the answer.

320
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,820
Be brave.
Believe in yourself.

321
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:55,282
I'm a complete loser. Please!
Please don't ever come here again.

322
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,910
If you want to form a soccer team,
just ask the other brothers.

323
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,831
Please, no more!

324
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,791
Hopeless.

325
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,340
Good morning, Fourth Brother.

326
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,010
Good morning, Sing.
How are you?

327
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,471
Let me introduce you
to a great guy. He's-

328
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,187
Nice to meet you!

329
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,563
I'm Fung.

330
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:29,316
It's an honor to meet
such a great businessman.

331
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,777
- He's got a lot of style.
- Fung is a soccer coach.

332
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,195
Soccer coach!

333
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,490
The world famous soccer coach.

334
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,408
You play soccer with your legs, right?

335
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,952
So, do you have a job for me?

336
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,872
- I want you to join my soccer team.
- Soccer team?

337
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,999
I haven't had a job in six months.

338
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:49,086
You can use your Empty Hand
to be the goalkeeper.

339
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:52,255
What's Empty Hand?
It's been so long.

340
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:54,341
You know, I even forgot
when our master died.

341
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,969
Listen. We're going to sign up
for the Supercup Tournament.

342
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,305
The prize is one million dollars.

343
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,141
Really? You must be the smart one.

344
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,602
You see? You're dressed up.

345
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,980
Our master taught us
that kung fu was sacred.

346
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:12,234
Now, you have this crazy idea
to use Shaolin for soccer.

347
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,527
Look.

348
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,403
This is the group picture
of our master and brothers.

349
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,739
I keep it under my pillow.

350
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,699
Great! Let's sit down
to talk about the picture.

351
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,913
I'll call you.
Keep a spot open for me.

352
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:31,419
Get lost! I really can't talk now.
My clients are waiting for me.

353
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,880
I'm doing a million dollar deal.
Can you hear me?

354
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:36,258
My driver's off today.

355
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:40,554
I lent my car to a friend
and left my wallet in my office.

356
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,390
I can't have lunch.
I never do.

357
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,517
I'm late! Please leave me alone.

358
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:50,272
Third Brother, you could use your
Iron Shirt technique as a fullback-

359
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:53,024
What's Iron Shirt?

360
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,777
Look. There are planes in the sky.

361
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,737
There are computers everywhere.

362
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,031
It's the 21 st century.
Please don't daydream.

363
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,243
I think we should combine
kung fu with soccer.

364
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:06,621
- We could win a lot of money.
- Are you crazy?

365
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:10,584
There's no way I'm taking time off
to play soccer.

366
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,919
Sorry, your odds are terrible.

367
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:16,298
We don't know anything about soccer.

368
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,175
And let's be honest.

369
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:21,094
We wouldn't stand a chance.

370
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,471
In fact, the probability
of winning is 0%.

371
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,849
- Proba-
- Probability.

372
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,267
Watch.

373
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:32,355
If I toss a coin it will be heads
or it will be tails.

374
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:37,319
The probability that we'd win is the
same as a coin landing on its edge.

375
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,988
- Let me try!
- Get lost!

376
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,241
I'm having lunch with a client!

377
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,911
You said you never eat lunch.

378
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:51,583
Time is money.
I've lost a lot just talking to you!

379
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:12,229
He's Sixth Small Brother,
Weight Vest.

380
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,439
This is the famous soccer coach, Fung.

381
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,442
Fung, how are you?

382
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,862
- Lead Weight?
- Shaolin Light Weight.

383
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,697
Nice to meet you, Mr. Weight.

384
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,617
Fifth Brother,
you want to play soccer?

385
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:29,621
Yes. If you use your
Light Weight skills as a winger...

386
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:33,041
- our offense would be perfect.
- Are you sure?

387
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,501
- Of course.
- Great.

388
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,503
Do they sell diet pills here?

389
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,130
It's useless.

390
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:43,051
Ever since the virus got into my brain,
I just can't lose any weight.

391
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:46,846
I'm no longer able to use
Shaolin kung fu Weight Vest...

392
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,975
and I can't run anymore.

393
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,728
Okay, you're a little overweight,
but it's not that important.

394
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,855
Forget it.

395
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,525
This was me.

396
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:04,197
I can't even get a date
looking like this.

397
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:06,283
You don't know what it's like.

398
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,369
- I do. I can't get a date either.
- Really?

399
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,746
I've read stories about your dates
in newspapers and magazines.

400
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,666
- What kind of papers and magazines?
- I'm sorry.

401
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,877
I can no longer control myself.

402
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,923
Please leave me alone.

403
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,884
Small Brother!

404
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:28,388
Believe in yourself.
I know you can do it.

405
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,141
Everyone calls me Lazy Pig now.

406
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,685
You're the only one
who still calls me Small Brother.

407
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,856
Thank you.

408
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,942
Lazy Pig, get me that roll
of toilet paper.

409
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,364
The red one.

410
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,431
- Soccer?
- Yes, Second Brother!

411
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:15,477
If you use Hooking Leg
as a fullback, I think-

412
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,729
- We'd be perfect!
- Right!

413
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,732
You think I can still do Hooking Leg?

414
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:23,985
You just need practice.

415
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:26,613
Believe in yourself,
and you'll get it back fast.

416
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,490
I doubt it.

417
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:31,326
Why are you washing dishes?

418
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,411
I thought you were a waiter.

419
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,706
Why? There are so many whys.

420
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:37,957
I don't know.

421
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,251
Why isn't my dad the rich?

422
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:44,547
Why am I going bald
even though I'm so handsome?

423
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:47,133
Why aren't you going bald
since you're so ugly?

424
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:51,679
Everyone else enjoyed their youth,
but I had to study Shaolin?

425
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:55,350
Just to become a dishwasher?
To clean up after people?

426
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,561
Calm down, Second Brother.

427
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,897
You should try to enjoy life.

428
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:05,527
Enjoy life? Stay here,
and I'll enjoy killing you!

429
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:08,696
Enjoy life?

430
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:13,451
You call that toilet clean?
It smells awful.

431
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:17,330
If it ever smells this bad again,
you'll clean it with your tongue.

432
00:40:56,954 --> 00:41:01,082
Your apartment looks great!
It's well furnished.

433
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,585
I can't believe you work
as a janitor...

434
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:07,881
but live in the penthouse
on the 59th floor.

435
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,049
You've got good taste.

436
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:16,055
This kind of apartment is so popular,
I can't even get one.

437
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:21,561
The ventilation is okay.
It's just a bit noisy.

438
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:24,522
Can I move in with you?

439
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:42,415
Forget it.
Your brothers aren't coming.

440
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:45,001
We can find other players.

441
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,754
It's my fault.
I'm not persuasive enough.

442
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:54,219
Not true.
You persuaded me, didn't you?

443
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,866
We don't have much time...

444
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,035
and you guys have a lot to learn.

445
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:04,539
So listen up and work as a team.

446
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,874
All right! Let's go!

447
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:18,803
Sell all my shares.
Yes, all five of them!

448
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,888
Don't laugh.

449
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,932
Hold on, I have another call.

450
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:25,226
It's coming down!

451
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,319
You finally decided
to come back down, huh?

452
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,279
We waited over an hour for you.

453
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,576
- What are you doing?
- Playing soccer!

454
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,536
The ball is over there!

455
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,086
You! Come here!

456
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,256
Let me see you kick the ball.

457
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:58,259
- The ball is over there.
- Yes. It's over there.

458
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:01,554
How can you kick it
if you can't even find it?

459
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:06,893
Now, there are four basic soccer drills:
Pass, dribble, hold and shoot.

460
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,895
- Coach!
- Shut up!

461
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,189
Let's get started.

462
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,900
Here.

463
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,862
Hold it.

464
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:21,032
Watch it. Concentrate.

465
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,538
Don't lose it.
You can do better than that.

466
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,083
Have you never seen a ball before?

467
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:33,086
You play like an old woman.

468
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:36,673
Fung, why can't I practice with them?

469
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:40,760
Your leg is strong,
but you have no control.

470
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:43,638
What if you kick the ball up
and hit a plane?

471
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,516
- Ever thought of that?
- No.

472
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,601
Small Brother.
I borrowed your eggs.

473
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:49,811
What?

474
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:53,731
If you can kick an egg without
breaking it, you can play with us.

475
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,400
No problem.

476
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,112
See. It's not easy.

477
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,581
Small Brother, stop it.

478
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:18,673
Oh, my God! My egg.

479
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,508
I'll get you another one.

480
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:23,886
I'll get you!
How could you do that!

481
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:26,472
Concentrate.

482
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:32,478
My egg!

483
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,912
Yes! Yes!

484
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,543
Go!

485
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,758
Yes. Go!

486
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:07,365
What are you doing?
How could you miss that one?

487
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,368
Get it! Come on!

488
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:56,455
- He's great.
- He could win a game by himself.

489
00:47:57,624 --> 00:48:01,627
No. It takes teamwork to win.

490
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:15,516
The game is 30 minutes,
with no breaks.

491
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:18,144
We'll follow the standard rules.
I'll referee.

492
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,187
- Anyone object?
- Of course not.

493
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:24,692
We're honored
to have Golden Leg referee.

494
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:27,320
All of us are big fans.

495
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,739
- This is Fung!
- Fung!

496
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,490
Okay.

497
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:36,704
Sing has already had
one run-in with your gang.

498
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:41,542
Let's be civilized,
and just play a clean game.

499
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:44,337
Their tidy uniform
and friendly faces...

500
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:48,674
- indicate that they are sincere.
- Thank you.

501
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:55,181
Relax. I'm a mechanic.

502
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:58,059
I carry this with me
so I won't lose it.

503
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:00,645
- I'm always on call.
- Yes, of course.

504
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:06,943
As I said, I'm a mechanic...

505
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,320
and that's why I carry a hammer.

506
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:13,115
I'm familiar with
your team's unusual reputation.

507
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:14,533
Don't worry.

508
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:19,246
Oh, good. I'm glad
we understand each other.

509
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:23,042
You better watch out.
Shake hands.

510
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:51,946
I'm open!

511
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:51,315
Third Brother!

512
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:22,429
We're under attack.
Send reinforcements.

513
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,390
We need reinforcements!

514
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:37,736
Stand up.

515
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:42,199
Get up! Stand up now!

516
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:44,869
I said now!

517
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:49,748
- What are you doing?
- They're killing us.

518
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,876
What did you expect?

519
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,713
You're going to let them
get away with this?

520
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,840
You're ejected!

521
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,718
Are you nuts?

522
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:05,181
This is a test.

523
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:08,684
If you guys can't pass it,
you shouldn't even bother playing!

524
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:12,271
We just want to play soccer,
not fight a war.

525
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:15,441
Soccer is war.
You must learn that.

526
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:29,580
I surrender!

527
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:42,676
I surrender.

528
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:46,680
You can't surrender.
We're still at war.

529
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:48,682
We're not letting you go home.

530
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:53,646
I can't take it anymore.

531
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:57,775
We're not good enough
to play with you.

532
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:01,320
Let me go to a doctor.

533
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,495
Put this on your head.

534
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:12,790
Look at you,
you look like a stray dog.

535
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:17,378
Where's your dignity?
I don't ever want to see you again.

536
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,964
Put it on your head
then you can go see a doctor.

537
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:35,062
Yes, I'm a dog. I have no dignity.

538
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,523
Give it to me.

539
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,726
Now it's our turn.

540
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,353
What?

541
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,523
Their powers are back.
I can feel it.

542
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:34,366
- Get your shoes ready!
- All right!

543
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:35,492
The final attack!

544
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:09,943
I can't believe I missed.

545
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,404
Help!

546
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:16,575
Thank you for helping us
get our kung fu back.

547
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:20,412
I'm honored to have you back.

548
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:22,206
It's our honor.

549
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:26,835
Just a second.

550
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:29,379
I'm the one who is honored.

551
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:33,634
You're going to make me rich!
Thank you!

552
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:36,929
We're sorry.

553
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,515
Can we join your team?
Please give us a chance!

554
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:40,974
Please!

555
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,760
Not a bad kick.

556
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:01,930
A bit more work
and Team Evil will be unbeatable.

557
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:09,688
Who is this?

558
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,316
The cripple?

559
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,401
- What's wrong?
- I'm sorry!

560
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:18,530
If it's an open tournament,
why won't you let me sign up?

561
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:21,491
Golden Leg!
What are you doing?

562
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:22,951
- Hung!
- He-

563
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:23,702
It's okay.

564
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:26,246
Hung, my team wants to sign up.

565
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:28,999
Anyone can sign up
for an open tournament.

566
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,584
That's not how it works.

567
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,294
I'm the chairman.

568
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,504
I decide who signs up.

569
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,590
- You get me?
- Yes.

570
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,467
What's the name of your team?

571
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:40,636
Come here.

572
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,387
This is Hung.

573
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:44,181
Hung!

574
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:00,864
This is quite a team.

575
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,783
I've gotta see them play.

576
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,618
What's the name again?

577
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:05,994
This is Shaolin-

578
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,913
Okay.

579
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:10,207
Go ahead and sign them up.

580
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,793
I'll even pay your application fee.

581
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,795
- Thank you!
- Don't mention it.

582
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:18,090
Cripple, you are my brother.

583
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:21,968
My shoe is dirty again.

584
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:25,097
White shoes get dirty a lot.

585
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:26,264
So-

586
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,392
I'll clean it for you!

587
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,769
I'm good at cleaning. Let me try.

588
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,230
It's my duty.

589
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,023
Let me try!

590
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:00,382
Hi.

591
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:07,806
What's going on?

592
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,188
Where are we going?

593
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:17,357
Why are you so quiet?

594
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:20,360
I need to go home.

595
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:30,662
- You're late.
- I won't be long.

596
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:04,029
Try it on.

597
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:06,573
No, I just want to see
the quality of it.

598
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:07,991
Touch it.

599
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:09,618
I'll get it dirty.

600
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:11,369
- Don't worry. Go ahead!
- No!

601
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,914
- Touch it!
- No.

602
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:19,628
- Like it?
- So smooth.

603
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:23,423
- Want one?
- I touched it. That's enough.

604
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:27,803
Tomorrow, I'm going to play
in a professional soccer game.

605
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:29,304
Really?

606
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:31,932
I'll be famous.

607
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:35,685
But if you hadn't fixed my shoes...

608
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,896
none of this would've happened.

609
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:40,941
You're very important to me.

610
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:44,528
I'll get you anything you want.

611
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,738
I'll have money soon.

612
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:53,912
If you become rich and famous,
please buy me sneakers.

613
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:57,040
You deserve more!

614
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,960
You should have more
confidence in yourself.

615
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:03,338
You're such a beautiful girl,
and you're a kung fu master.

616
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:05,090
You've got it all.

617
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:08,343
You shouldn't let your hair
cover your face.

618
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:10,804
Come on!

619
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,889
- Come on. Look at me!
- No.

620
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:14,933
Look at me!

621
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:18,937
You're beautiful!

622
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:21,439
Really?

623
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:23,275
Sure.

624
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:31,408
- Is that a fly?
- Yes, but I missed it.

625
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:34,452
- Did you get it?
- I did.

626
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:36,413
Sorry. I made your hand dirty.

627
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:37,914
It's okay.

628
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,125
You're such a beautiful girl.

629
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:44,170
Do you know that?

630
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:45,380
I guess.

631
01:04:45,506 --> 01:04:48,800
Thank you! Thanks so much!
You sure you know?

632
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:52,679
Where were you?

633
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:55,891
I let you bring a girl here because
you promised to clean the floor.

634
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:58,476
I will get punished
if you don't clean it.

635
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:01,104
Go home. I'll call you later.

636
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:11,197
Remember: Be confident.
You're the best.

637
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:18,580
- I like your shirt.
- I like your socks.

638
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:19,998
- Let's trade.
- Good.

639
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:23,793
Guys, don't be nervous.
Just try to have fun.

640
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,046
There'll be tons of reporters
and a big crowd.

641
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:28,673
Try to smile for the photographers.

642
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,927
Be sure to thank the fans.

643
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:33,887
Thank you!

644
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:40,852
Thanks for your support!
Thank you!

645
01:05:40,978 --> 01:05:43,563
- They're just janitors.
- They're still our audience.

646
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:45,231
Thank you!

647
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,192
Shut up!

648
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,904
Where is everyone. You said-

649
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,447
It's just the first round.

650
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:55,200
We have to make it to the finals.

651
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:58,745
- Great! Let's get to the finals!
- Shut up!

652
01:06:06,587 --> 01:06:08,713
Team Shaolin?

653
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,260
Look at this guy.

654
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:19,891
Look at that guy.

655
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:25,105
What's wrong?

656
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:26,898
No smoking?

657
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:42,747
What happened?

658
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:46,751
It's impossible. Just a trick.

659
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:57,137
What's going on?

660
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:01,474
Okay, it's a trick.

661
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,685
Let's show them what we can do.

662
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:04,811
All right!

663
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,649
Oh, come on!

664
01:07:17,324 --> 01:07:21,327
Please play fair.
Give us a chance.

665
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:26,958
Hung, it's for you.

666
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:34,174
Your tricks don't scare me!

667
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:11,711
What? Forty to zip?

668
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:23,014
Yeah!

669
01:08:39,865 --> 01:08:42,200
Iron Head scores!

670
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,362
We bring the power of Shaolin
to soccer.

671
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:22,282
Kung fu is great. It's wonderful!

672
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:27,162
I want to say hi to my parents and
my Shaolin master, but they're all dead.

673
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:29,038
I also want to say hi
to my friend, Mui.

674
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,957
Mui, how are you?

675
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:33,334
I'll see you soon.

676
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,139
Hi. Can I help you?

677
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:48,349
- I want-
- I understand.

678
01:09:48,475 --> 01:09:50,476
I'll take care of you.

679
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:00,904
Show us something.

680
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,864
Sure. Small Brother!

681
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:06,618
Great!

682
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:09,037
Can you show us more?

683
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:10,496
Sure!

684
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,057
Take it easy.

685
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:38,566
My brothers, today we say good-bye
to our old lives and old shoes.

686
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,782
- Hey, don't throw those around.
- Sorry.

687
01:10:53,874 --> 01:10:54,874
Mui?

688
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:56,876
What's up?

689
01:10:58,128 --> 01:11:00,088
You look great tonight.

690
01:11:02,549 --> 01:11:03,508
Just a little.

691
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:06,386
It's a big difference.
You're so heavily made up.

692
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:09,055
So you think I look nice?

693
01:11:09,181 --> 01:11:12,600
I have big news for you.
We won the soccer match.

694
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:16,104
I know. I saw you guys on TV.

695
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:17,230
Congratulations.

696
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,275
This is for you.

697
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:28,116
Thank you.

698
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:30,201
Let me introduce you to my friends.

699
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:32,537
Nice outfit.

700
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:35,415
Hey, let me introduce you guys
to a new friend.

701
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:37,000
Is she a ghost?

702
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:39,502
This is my friend.

703
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:41,504
- Girlfriend?
- No.

704
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:44,507
This is Mui, the Tai Chi Master
I told you guys about.

705
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:47,218
- Oh, nice to meet you.
- Your girlfriend is quite unique.

706
01:11:47,344 --> 01:11:49,762
- Yes.
- That's great.

707
01:11:50,597 --> 01:11:53,099
I've never seen
shoulder pads so big.

708
01:11:53,225 --> 01:11:55,935
I've decided to start a new trend.

709
01:11:56,061 --> 01:11:57,979
See? It's fashionable.

710
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:02,233
Don't walk around at night.

711
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:03,985
It's quite scary.

712
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:08,197
It's okay.
People will get used to it soon.

713
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:11,326
It will work pretty well in football.

714
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:13,411
You want to borrow them?

715
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,581
Stop it. It's not proper to talk
to a lady like this.

716
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:19,167
It's okay, I can take it.

717
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:22,628
Although she's a girl,
she has a great sense of humor.

718
01:12:24,298 --> 01:12:26,799
Mui, show us a sexy pose.

719
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:34,932
Give us a kiss.

720
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:44,942
- What's wrong?
- Don't touch me.

721
01:12:49,114 --> 01:12:50,448
Are you mad?

722
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:55,828
- No, I'm not mad.
- Then-

723
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:04,087
I'm sorry.

724
01:13:05,339 --> 01:13:06,923
We were just joking.

725
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:09,384
I know you were just joking.

726
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:12,553
I'm sorry,
I didn't mind at all-

727
01:13:12,679 --> 01:13:14,180
Don't be like this.

728
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:16,391
Then why are you like this?

729
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:27,735
Take your hand off me-

730
01:13:27,861 --> 01:13:29,195
Boss!

731
01:13:29,321 --> 01:13:31,072
What the hell are you doing?

732
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:32,865
I was just out playing mah-jongg.

733
01:13:32,991 --> 01:13:36,744
Look at what you did to yourself?
You look like a ghost.

734
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:39,038
Have you no shame?
You are such a disgrace.

735
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:40,373
Hey, enough!

736
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:44,752
Mui has the right
to dress how she wants.

737
01:13:44,878 --> 01:13:47,171
Can't you respect that?

738
01:13:47,297 --> 01:13:49,924
- I think she looks very nice today.
- Yes.

739
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:52,218
- She looks great.
- Don't be mean to her.

740
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:57,598
I'll yell at her if I want to.
Who the hell are you guys?

741
01:13:58,559 --> 01:13:59,892
They are my friends.

742
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:05,940
I agree with them completely.

743
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:10,903
I think I look beautiful now.

744
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:14,323
And I like the way I am.

745
01:14:16,368 --> 01:14:18,244
If you don't like it...

746
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:20,746
you can simply go away.

747
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,750
Who do you think
you're talking to?

748
01:14:26,044 --> 01:14:27,879
I'm talking to you.

749
01:14:28,922 --> 01:14:31,048
You are a mean
and coldhearted boss.

750
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:32,758
You're asking for it!

751
01:14:34,386 --> 01:14:37,263
How dare you hit me?

752
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:49,108
I can't believe this.
Who do you think you are?

753
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:55,198
I am who I am.
I am Mui.

754
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:58,284
I'm gonna tell
your mother about this.

755
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:05,416
Mui, well done!

756
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:08,419
We were just joking earlier.
Please forgive us.

757
01:15:08,545 --> 01:15:12,507
We weren't laughing at you,
your sexy pose really was sexy.

758
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:17,637
Really?

759
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:27,855
Do you...

760
01:15:27,981 --> 01:15:30,233
like the way I look?

761
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:31,442
Well-

762
01:15:31,568 --> 01:15:34,946
You certainly have more confidence.

763
01:15:41,995 --> 01:15:43,913
I want to tell you something.

764
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:45,706
What?

765
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:48,251
I like you.

766
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,294
I like you too.

767
01:15:53,257 --> 01:15:55,675
Is this love?

768
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:01,055
You-

769
01:16:01,181 --> 01:16:02,682
You're joking.

770
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:07,311
No. I'm serious.

771
01:16:08,313 --> 01:16:10,356
Absolutely not. This is not love.

772
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:17,196
We're friends forever.

773
01:16:18,615 --> 01:16:20,741
Don't you think we should be friends?

774
01:16:20,867 --> 01:16:22,660
It's fine.

775
01:16:29,876 --> 01:16:34,547
So you'll still come see me?

776
01:16:35,632 --> 01:16:38,217
I can still fix your shoes.

777
01:16:38,343 --> 01:16:42,054
No, thanks. I can buy new ones.

778
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:45,433
Things have changed.

779
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:48,185
I have to think about the future.

780
01:16:56,903 --> 01:16:58,779
Don't be like this.

781
01:16:59,823 --> 01:17:01,907
You're crying.

782
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:05,411
Don't be that way.

783
01:17:17,507 --> 01:17:19,300
I understand.

784
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,053
Sorry.

785
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,893
- Congratulations!
- Sit with us.

786
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:30,478
Cheers!

787
01:17:38,445 --> 01:17:40,529
If we win this, we'll go to the finals.

788
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:41,739
To the finals!

789
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:44,283
- But don't underestimate our opponent.
- Underestimate our opponent!

790
01:17:48,246 --> 01:17:51,165
You don't have a chance.

791
01:17:51,291 --> 01:17:53,292
We haven't lost all year.

792
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:04,261
How'd they do that?

793
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:06,097
It must be special effects.

794
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:28,179
- Good morning, Hung.
- Good morning.

795
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:29,764
Come here.

796
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:32,183
You're a lucky guy.

797
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:34,268
You're lucky to coach
such a great team.

798
01:19:34,394 --> 01:19:35,311
Thank you.

799
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:38,898
Iron Head and Iron Shirt is practiced
as performance art on the street.

800
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:41,066
It's amusing to see your team
use kung fu to play soccer...

801
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:42,902
and make it to the finals.

802
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:44,945
You did a good job.

803
01:19:45,071 --> 01:19:46,989
Don't waste our time.

804
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:51,243
If you forfeit the game
you can join my Evil Team.

805
01:19:53,079 --> 01:19:56,123
It's not a bad check this time.

806
01:19:56,249 --> 01:19:58,918
You can get the money
before you sign the deal.

807
01:19:59,753 --> 01:20:01,378
That's a lot of money.

808
01:20:01,505 --> 01:20:03,464
Enough to retire.

809
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:06,550
Of course. We're like brothers.

810
01:20:06,676 --> 01:20:09,804
Thank you.
But I don't think I can accept it.

811
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:13,724
What? Do you think
I'm trying to trick you?

812
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:16,644
I think you've
put a great team together.

813
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:18,687
I'd like you to come work for me.

814
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:20,606
Don't get upset.

815
01:20:20,732 --> 01:20:23,400
Think about your future.
Forget about our past, okay?

816
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:27,321
Hung, I'm not mad at you anymore.

817
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:32,117
I know it was all my faults.
I can't blame anyone else.

818
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:35,496
You're lying.

819
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:38,457
I know you too well.
You're too greedy to pass this up.

820
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:42,837
You're right.

821
01:20:43,588 --> 01:20:46,507
I am greedy.
My team is greedy too.

822
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:49,134
But we don't care about the money.

823
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:51,178
We care about the championship.

824
01:20:52,556 --> 01:20:53,806
See you on the soccer field.

825
01:21:28,842 --> 01:21:30,509
Pull over.

826
01:21:36,182 --> 01:21:38,517
- Mui!
- She's dead!

827
01:21:39,185 --> 01:21:40,853
How?

828
01:21:41,521 --> 01:21:43,898
- I killed her!
- Impossible!

829
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:47,651
Mui is a kung fu master.
You could never hurt her.

830
01:21:47,777 --> 01:21:49,820
What do you want?

831
01:21:49,946 --> 01:21:52,114
Revenge!

832
01:21:52,782 --> 01:21:54,992
Come on. It was only a joke.

833
01:21:55,118 --> 01:21:57,703
She's still alive.
She just doesn't work here anymore.

834
01:21:58,788 --> 01:22:00,581
Why not?

835
01:22:00,707 --> 01:22:03,459
Well, we're famous for our
sweet steamed buns...

836
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:06,545
and Mui made
the sweetest ones of all.

837
01:22:06,671 --> 01:22:10,591
But now they're salty and bitter.
She was ruining my business.

838
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:12,009
There was salt in them?

839
01:22:12,135 --> 01:22:13,761
Yes.

840
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:16,180
Now is there anything else
I can do for you, sir?

841
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:22,019
No thanks.

842
01:23:26,543 --> 01:23:27,835
Hey!

843
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:30,295
We've got a game to play!

844
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:12,106
Will Team Evil
score a lot of goals today?

845
01:25:12,232 --> 01:25:14,775
Scoring goals is not
the only way to win.

846
01:25:15,985 --> 01:25:18,070
But make no mistake, we will win.

847
01:27:56,145 --> 01:27:57,437
No way!

848
01:28:01,985 --> 01:28:04,569
Those American drugs
work better than I expected.

849
01:28:26,259 --> 01:28:28,343
Actually, the referee, linesman...

850
01:28:28,469 --> 01:28:32,264
soccer association, soccer federation
and soccer committee...

851
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:35,809
all stand on my side.
How can they possibly beat me?

852
01:29:08,843 --> 01:29:12,012
No problem!

853
01:29:14,057 --> 01:29:15,640
- You rule!
- Good job!

854
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:17,351
You the man!

855
01:30:16,702 --> 01:30:20,539
Throw-in? Are you crazy?

856
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:23,583
How can you call that a throw-in?

857
01:30:23,709 --> 01:30:26,211
Hung, are you here to fight
or play soccer?

858
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:29,381
I should break their legs
like I broke yours!

859
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:32,175
Then you'd have
a whole team of cripples!

860
01:30:32,301 --> 01:30:35,887
Cripples! Cripples!
At least you'd have company.

861
01:30:38,808 --> 01:30:41,017
I'm sorry. I should take a break.

862
01:30:41,144 --> 01:30:43,812
It's okay.
Your body may leave the field...

863
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:46,440
but your spirit will stay behind.

864
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:05,917
Get ready! It's my turn.

865
01:31:24,854 --> 01:31:26,229
Small Brother!

866
01:32:02,934 --> 01:32:05,810
Wake up! The clock already ran out.

867
01:32:12,818 --> 01:32:15,362
It's only halftime.
Their team is already badly injured.

868
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:17,447
They won't be able to play
the second half. Go home!

869
01:32:17,573 --> 01:32:19,533
You won't be able
to finish the game.

870
01:32:19,659 --> 01:32:21,076
Boring.

871
01:32:21,202 --> 01:32:23,495
I'll dance to provide
some entertainment.

872
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:26,623
No, you're not going to dance.
I am!

873
01:32:31,754 --> 01:32:33,171
I've had enough.

874
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:51,189
Break it up!

875
01:32:53,234 --> 01:32:55,235
You want me to eject someone?

876
01:32:56,195 --> 01:32:58,113
Who did that?

877
01:32:58,239 --> 01:32:59,781
Did anyone see?

878
01:33:01,033 --> 01:33:02,909
I'd like to see you do that
to my face!

879
01:33:03,786 --> 01:33:05,078
Gently.

880
01:33:05,204 --> 01:33:07,914
What kind of kung fu was that?

881
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:11,459
I can't take much more!

882
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:15,547
I knew they would play dirty.

883
01:33:15,673 --> 01:33:17,591
I just didn't think
they would play this dirty.

884
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:19,467
They've never been this good.

885
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:21,761
They must be cheating.

886
01:33:21,887 --> 01:33:23,430
Call the police.

887
01:33:23,556 --> 01:33:26,099
We just have to play harder.

888
01:33:26,225 --> 01:33:27,642
We can still win this!

889
01:33:27,768 --> 01:33:29,728
I forgot. I left the oven on!

890
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:32,772
My wife needs me.
She's about to have a baby.

891
01:33:32,898 --> 01:33:36,192
Can't she wait until the game's over?

892
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:38,153
But they're killing us!

893
01:33:38,279 --> 01:33:40,071
Please. I'm begging you.

894
01:33:40,197 --> 01:33:43,700
- I'm begging you too.
- Wait. Wait!

895
01:33:45,411 --> 01:33:48,413
Calm down.

896
01:33:48,539 --> 01:33:49,998
Calm down!

897
01:33:51,542 --> 01:33:54,377
He's right!

898
01:33:54,962 --> 01:33:58,173
We must pull together.

899
01:33:58,841 --> 01:34:00,634
We only have eight players left.

900
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:04,679
If one more is injured,
we have to forfeit.

901
01:34:04,805 --> 01:34:07,766
We'll have to show these guys
that we can block their killer kicks!

902
01:34:07,892 --> 01:34:10,644
That's easy for you to say.
You try blocking one of them.

903
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:12,771
What are you talking about?

904
01:34:13,689 --> 01:34:15,148
Calm down.

905
01:34:15,274 --> 01:34:18,068
Calm down!

906
01:34:18,194 --> 01:34:19,944
Shut up.

907
01:34:26,285 --> 01:34:28,328
I wonder if I can block them.

908
01:34:44,762 --> 01:34:46,346
Shaolin Barricade Shield!

909
01:34:49,642 --> 01:34:50,850
Barricade?

910
01:34:53,938 --> 01:34:56,314
They can't even block one kick!

911
01:34:58,317 --> 01:34:59,943
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

912
01:35:39,650 --> 01:35:41,651
Chun, it's Tin.

913
01:35:43,446 --> 01:35:48,032
I've kept this secret for 20 years.

914
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:50,994
I love you.

915
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:38,792
Are we playing too dirty?

916
01:36:38,918 --> 01:36:41,836
- I don't think so.
- Really?

917
01:36:41,962 --> 01:36:43,755
Play even dirtier!

918
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:18,289
Brothers! Go!

919
01:37:19,458 --> 01:37:20,333
What?

920
01:37:24,046 --> 01:37:26,089
Look out!

921
01:37:52,366 --> 01:37:53,658
Get it!

922
01:37:56,745 --> 01:37:57,996
I don't believe it.

923
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:25,982
Get up! If you're injured,
you forfeit!

924
01:38:27,067 --> 01:38:29,569
You're right. I'm fine.

925
01:38:34,575 --> 01:38:37,160
The game's almost over!
Use the special attack!

926
01:38:37,286 --> 01:38:39,037
Special attack?

927
01:39:11,236 --> 01:39:15,782
That's it. They're out of players.
We won!

928
01:39:22,039 --> 01:39:25,458
Team Shaolin,
I only see seven players.

929
01:39:25,584 --> 01:39:29,295
If you don't have a substitute
you'll forfeit the game.

930
01:39:29,421 --> 01:39:31,422
Those are the rules.

931
01:39:36,929 --> 01:39:38,930
Any substitutes?

932
01:39:40,265 --> 01:39:42,642
Congratulations!

933
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:47,063
I'm here.

934
01:39:47,189 --> 01:39:49,399
I'm their substitute.

935
01:39:49,525 --> 01:39:51,526
I'm a goalie.

936
01:39:57,574 --> 01:39:59,450
Why do you look like E.T.?

937
01:40:00,452 --> 01:40:03,121
You said I should
get rid of the hair in my eyes.

938
01:40:03,247 --> 01:40:04,414
What are you doing here?

939
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:06,290
I want to help.

940
01:40:06,417 --> 01:40:08,167
How can you help?

941
01:40:08,293 --> 01:40:10,586
Phone home.
You don't belong on Earth.

942
01:40:10,713 --> 01:40:12,964
I really want to help.
Trust me.

943
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:15,508
- Let me try.
- No way!

944
01:40:15,634 --> 01:40:18,845
Look. You can't play in those.

945
01:40:20,973 --> 01:40:22,640
Put these on.

946
01:41:07,978 --> 01:41:09,812
The other side.

947
01:41:21,950 --> 01:41:23,117
Go!

948
01:41:23,243 --> 01:41:24,702
All right!

949
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:41,385
Watch out!

950
01:43:49,681 --> 01:43:54,393
What happened?

951
01:43:54,519 --> 01:43:57,396
- Boss, watch out!
- Don't touch me!

952
01:44:00,859 --> 01:44:06,030
Boss!

953
01:45:31,616 --> 01:45:36,120
Shaolin Team wins the championship.

954
01:45:38,332 --> 01:45:40,791
Evil Team's drug use leads to
permanent suspension.

955
01:45:40,917 --> 01:45:43,252
Coach Hung sentenced
to five years in jail.

956
01:46:58,870 --> 01:47:00,371
Wait.

957
01:47:00,497 --> 01:47:02,832
Stop the bus.

958
01:47:27,566 --> 01:47:30,734
Phone home.
You don't belong on Earth.

959
01:47:31,611 --> 01:47:34,029
I'm talking about thousands of dollars.

960
01:47:34,156 --> 01:47:36,949
You're a bunch of losers-

961
01:47:37,075 --> 01:47:38,951
Don't laugh.

962
01:47:39,077 --> 01:47:41,203
The grand prize is a lot of money.

963
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:46,834
I can't get it out.

964
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:49,962
I'm a postgraduate student.

965
01:47:50,088 --> 01:47:52,006
Postgraduate student?

966
01:47:52,132 --> 01:47:53,215
Let's start over.

967
01:47:53,341 --> 01:47:56,594
I'm a postgraduate student.

968
01:47:58,221 --> 01:48:00,264
- What's wrong?
- Don't touch me.

969
01:48:00,932 --> 01:48:01,974
Are you mad?

970
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:04,602
No, I'm not mad.

971
01:48:10,775 --> 01:48:12,943
- What's wrong?
- Don't touch me.

972
01:48:13,778 --> 01:48:14,945
Are you mad?

973
01:48:15,071 --> 01:48:17,072
- I'm not mad.
- Then-

974
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:28,834
I am begging you.

975
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:31,629
Don't do this.

976
01:48:32,631 --> 01:48:34,882
You have to help me.

977
01:48:35,008 --> 01:48:37,009
Please, don't!

978
01:48:39,554 --> 01:48:41,472
It's great

979
01:48:41,598 --> 01:48:43,766
I don't know the lyrics. Sorry.

980
01:48:46,311 --> 01:48:47,978
Don't you dare!

981
01:48:54,110 --> 01:48:56,612
- They're just janitors.
- They're still our-

982
01:48:58,907 --> 01:49:01,867
I heard you have amazing legs.

983
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:04,954
Cut!

984
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:09,875
This is a crescent wrench.
It's for screwing-

985
01:49:10,001 --> 01:49:11,877
- Are you sure?
- You're so sick.

986
01:49:12,003 --> 01:49:14,672
My team is greedy too.

987
01:49:14,798 --> 01:49:17,383
But we don't care
about this plane ticket-

988
01:49:17,509 --> 01:49:19,218
Plane ticket?
Are you going somewhere?

989
01:49:43,326 --> 01:49:46,662
Chun, it's Tin.

990
01:49:47,414 --> 01:49:51,375
I've kept this secret for 20 years.

991
01:49:51,501 --> 01:49:54,086
I love you.

992
01:49:54,212 --> 01:49:56,672
This is not Chun.
This is Kung.

993
01:49:56,798 --> 01:49:58,841
Sorry, Kung.

994
01:49:58,967 --> 01:50:01,969
Please tell your wife
what I just told you.
