1
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,911
Thank you.

2
00:02:31,004 --> 00:02:36,554
<i>I wish they all
could be California girls</i>

3
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,707
- The Beach Boys are dope.
- I love Beach Boys.

4
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,027
Hey, ladies, how you doin'?
Wait a minute.

5
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,860
Hey, where you goin'?
Let's get some sushi!

6
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,147
Hey! Hey, cutie!

7
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,230
<i>I wish they all could...</i>

8
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,098
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

9
00:03:04,198 --> 00:03:07,990
That was my CD.
Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.

10
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,760
Did you see the way those girls
drove off? They was laughing at us.

11
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,100
Those girls drove off because of you.

12
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,530
All I did was invite them
to have a drink.

13
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:20,297
You invited them to get naked
and sacrifice a small goat.

14
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,280
Which word was "goat"?

15
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,400
You owe me a copy
of The Beach Boys' greatest hits.

16
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,880
Don't be gettin' no attitude
with me, Lee.

17
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,337
I been here three days and ain't done
nothin' but work your cases.

18
00:03:29,437 --> 00:03:33,220
Only reason why I'm here in Hong Kong is
'cause you was gonna show me a good time.

19
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,040
I'm on vacation, man,
and I want some mu shu.

20
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,465
- Mu shu? You hungry?
- No, Lee, not mu shu. Some mu shu.

21
00:03:40,565 --> 00:03:42,235
I wanna see some women, man.

22
00:03:42,335 --> 00:03:44,625
Now stop playin' dumb
and show me to the shu.

23
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:18,260
What was that? Did you just take another
damn case on my vacation, man?

24
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,030
Of course not.
My superintendent invited us to a club.

25
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,260
- Big party tonight.
- Don't be messin' with me, Lee.

26
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,600
I will slap you so hard,
you'll end up in the Ming dynasty.

27
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,710
I mean it, man.
I'll bitch-slap you back to Bangkok.

28
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,640
- Big party?
- Big one.

29
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,167
Okay, well, let's go party then.

30
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,580
Hey, this is nice. Hey, cutie.

31
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,313
They don't like tourists in here,
so try to blend in.

32
00:04:46,413 --> 00:04:49,807
What do you mean, blend in?
I'm 2 feet taller than everybody in here.

33
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,315
Wait here.

34
00:04:54,415 --> 00:04:56,280
- Where you goin'?
- Bathroom.

35
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,742
Hurry back, man,
'cause we gonna party. Party!

36
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,800
How you doin'?

37
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,864
Come here a lot? It's a nice place.

38
00:05:17,964 --> 00:05:22,100
<i>Take us through the hours</i>

39
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,620
<i>I won't make you, baby</i>

40
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,207
What in the world
is goin' on up in here?

41
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,150
Am I the only one listenin' to this?

42
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,000
The man destroyin' a classic!

43
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,280
<i>To the force don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough</i>

44
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,965
<i>Keep on till the force don't stop</i>

45
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:40,810
- <i>Don't stop till you get enough</i>
- Boo!

46
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,823
<i>With the force don't stop
Till the force starts up</i>

47
00:05:43,923 --> 00:05:45,435
<i>Don't stop till you get enough</i>

48
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:48,177
I can't take no more of this, man.

49
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,600
<i>Get closer, oh, get closer</i>

50
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,957
<i>I'm burnin' now</i>

51
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,927
<i>Just love me</i>

52
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,160
<i>Till you don't know how</i>

53
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,970
<i>Keep on till the force starts up</i>

54
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,536
<i>Don't stop till you get enough, keep on</i>

55
00:06:35,636 --> 00:06:38,607
<i>Till the force starts up
Don't stop till you get enough</i>

56
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,531
<i>Keep on till the force starts up</i>

57
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:45,671
<i>Oh, come on, girls
Come on till the force starts up</i>

58
00:06:45,771 --> 00:06:48,337
<i>Don't stop till you get enough</i>

59
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,736
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

60
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,480
<i>Come here, girls</i>

61
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,721
<i>Don't stop till you... come on, girls</i>

62
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:03,920
<i>I can't believe it
Don't stop till you get enough</i>

63
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,120
<i>Come on, come on, come on, come on</i>

64
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,727
<i>Come on, don't stop
You know you feel the force</i>

65
00:07:11,494 --> 00:07:13,317
<i>Don't stop till you get enough</i>

66
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,890
- <i>I feel the force</i>
- Carter!

67
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,950
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

68
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,930
- Carter!
- <i>Come on, Lee</i>

69
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,790
- Carter!
- <i>Come on</i>

70
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,940
- Carter!
- <i>Come on, come on</i>

71
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,430
<i>I'll be right back, I'll be right back</i>

72
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,420
<i>I'll be right back</i>

73
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,970
Lee, these people love me.
Come on out here.

74
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,332
- Get off the stage.
- Are you crazy, man? I'm a star!

75
00:07:38,432 --> 00:07:40,180
I'm a god to these people.
Come check this out.

76
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,567
This is a gangster bar.
We are here undercover.

77
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,510
I knew you was lyin'.
I knew you was lyin', man.

78
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,520
- I'm sorry, Carter.
- You a liar!

79
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,800
We are here to find Ricky Tan.
We must tread softly.

80
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,096
Tread softly?
What in the world you talkin' about?

81
00:07:57,196 --> 00:07:59,380
Who taught you how to roust a bar?
"Tread softly."

82
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,150
These men are Triads,
the most deadly gang in China.

83
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,890
You think that scare me?
I'm from Los Angeles. We invented gangs.

84
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,520
- Give me that badge.
- No! You are civilian!

85
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,592
In Hong Kong, I am Michael Jackson!
You are Toto!

86
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:14,360
You mean Tito! Toto is what
we ate last night for dinner.

87
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,517
- Now give me that badge. Give it...
- No!

88
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,316
Okay, listen up!

89
00:08:32,005 --> 00:08:34,027
Right now!

90
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,209
- What did I just say?
- You just asked everybody

91
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:50,680
to pick up their samurai swords...
and shave your butt.

92
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,567
- I said that?
- Yes.

93
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,646
Come out here and translate this
for me. Come on.

94
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:02,660
All right, listen up! All the Triads
and the ugly women on this side,

95
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,105
and all the fine women
on this side right now!

96
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,507
Translate it.

97
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,528
Okay, y'all gonna act like y'all
don't hear what I'm sayin'.

98
00:09:16,728 --> 00:09:19,777
Who in here know Ricky Tan?
Raise your hand.

99
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,422
Translate.

100
00:09:30,632 --> 00:09:32,128
I see what's goin' on here.

101
00:09:32,228 --> 00:09:36,070
Okay. I ain't got time to be playin'
no games now.

102
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,330
- I'm takin' everybody...
- Hu Li!

103
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,041
Hey, Lee!

104
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,863
Out of the way! L.A.P.D.!

105
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,962
Lee! Hold up!

106
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,980
Oh, hell no.

107
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,633
Lee, I'm takin' the stairs!

108
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,039
Sorry.

109
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,963
Carter!

110
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,691
Over here!

111
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,160
- Lee!
- Help me!

112
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,230
- How you get down there?
- Hurry up!

113
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,487
Hold on! Don't let go, man.

114
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,627
- Here.
- Watch out behind you!

115
00:12:42,856 --> 00:12:45,107
- Behind you!
- What?

116
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,420
Who the hell was that?

117
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,605
Lord Jesus, I don't wanna die!

118
00:12:57,705 --> 00:12:59,240
Lee, help me, man!

119
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,789
Don't worry.
Chinese bamboo is very strong.

120
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,412
- You sure, man?
- I'm sure.

121
00:13:11,288 --> 00:13:12,972
Lee!

122
00:13:23,332 --> 00:13:24,904
Let go! Let go!

123
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:28,227
I can't believe I flew
10,000 miles for this shit!

124
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,176
I can't believe you lied to me, man.

125
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,762
- I'm sorry.
- You sorry?

126
00:13:45,862 --> 00:13:48,403
I got somebody's old chopsticks
stuck up my ass,

127
00:13:48,503 --> 00:13:51,105
and all you gotta say to me
is you sorry?

128
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,440
- There was an explosion.
- I don't give a damn!

129
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,867
At the American embassy.
Two Americans were killed.

130
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,482
So you think this guy Ricky Tan
blew up the embassy?

131
00:14:01,582 --> 00:14:04,231
- I don't know.
- Why the hell are you lookin' for him then?

132
00:14:04,331 --> 00:14:06,943
- We're gonna find out.
- No, you gonna find out, man.

133
00:14:07,043 --> 00:14:10,545
There's two billion Chinese people here.
Let one of them be your partner.

134
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:20,050
- Where the hell we at now?
- Massage parlor. Heaven on earth.

135
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,960
Now this is more like it.

136
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:26,330
I'm about to go in here and get a massage
and a hot tea bath right now.

137
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:31,090
- Just follow my lead. Act like a tourist.
- I am a tourist, fool.

138
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:36,979
Hey! Slow down, Chen!
Hell is wrong with you?

139
00:14:45,228 --> 00:14:46,870
...girl. Yeah.

140
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,215
My American friend is on vacation.
I want to show him a good time.

141
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:53,170
- You American.
- Yeah.

142
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,750
You bring American money?

143
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,011
- I got it, Lee. I got it.
- No. You sure?

144
00:14:58,111 --> 00:15:00,200
I'm sure.

145
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,800
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

146
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,337
Right this way, gentlemen.

147
00:15:13,543 --> 00:15:14,650
Are you ready?

148
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,807
You ready? I'm ready.

149
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,668
Oh, my goodness!

150
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,150
This place is off the hook!
I love Hong Kong.

151
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,550
- You get massage from Chinese girl before?
- No, but I heard it was the bomb.

152
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,512
Come with me.

153
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,510
You pick any girl
for you and your friend.

154
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,325
- Any girl?
- Any girl.

155
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,316
Okay.

156
00:15:42,981 --> 00:15:45,161
I don't know where to start.

157
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,307
I'll take that one right there.
She got to come.

158
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,217
Yes, she's very nice.

159
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:55,130
She is nice, but I hurt my back and my neck,
and I need a little bit more massage.

160
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,200
You know?
So I'm gonna take her in the pink too.

161
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,642
- Oh, yes.
- And let me get her. Hey, baby.

162
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:04,980
And let me have her. Can I get her too?
And her right there. She good with feet?

163
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,314
- Oh, yes.
- What are you doing?

164
00:16:07,414 --> 00:16:09,976
She said I could have any girl
I want in here. Wait a minute.

165
00:16:10,076 --> 00:16:11,641
Well, hurry up!

166
00:16:11,741 --> 00:16:14,890
What's wrong with you? You don't jump
in front of a black man in a buffet line.

167
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:19,320
- Calm down! I have to...
- Your friend has big appetite.

168
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,770
Please, follow her upstairs
into the quiet room.

169
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,516
It ain't gonna be no quiet room no more.

170
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,873
In a... oh.

171
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,811
Y'all don't know how good this feels.

172
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,811
I got in a big fight last night
with the Triads.

173
00:16:36,911 --> 00:16:39,620
Y'all ever heard of the Triads?
I beat down like 20 of 'em.

174
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,460
Y'all should've seen me. It was on.

175
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,654
- Lee! Lee!
- Yeah?

176
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:48,290
This is what I'm talkin' about, man.
Now I'm on vacation.

177
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,487
I knew you'd come through.
I just knew it.

178
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,268
America? Wanna come to America with me?

179
00:16:55,868 --> 00:16:57,900
Ever been to America?

180
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,100
Lee, how's your girl?

181
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,934
- Lee, what's wrong?
- That's Ricky Tan.

182
00:17:03,334 --> 00:17:06,304
That's Ricky Tan?
That's a midget in a bathrobe!

183
00:17:06,904 --> 00:17:08,071
I will call for backup.

184
00:17:08,171 --> 00:17:10,610
The man is four feet tall.
Let's go bust him right now.

185
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,142
- No.
- No?

186
00:17:12,242 --> 00:17:15,507
- He's a very dangerous man.
- I'm a very dangerous man.

187
00:17:15,607 --> 00:17:17,476
Look, let's go over there
and bust him, man.

188
00:17:17,576 --> 00:17:19,760
You're not about to mess up my massage,
I'm telling you right now.

189
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,937
- Stay here.
- You don't need backup. I got your back...

190
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,891
Excuse me for a minute.
Just for a minute.

191
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,321
I'll be back. Don't...

192
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,664
I'll be back.

193
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,105
Ricky?

194
00:17:40,205 --> 00:17:43,570
Ricky Tan? Get up, dog. Let's go.
I've been lookin' for you everywhere.

195
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,723
I'm busy at the moment.

196
00:17:45,823 --> 00:17:50,031
Did you hear what I said? I'm busy too.
Now get on your feet. Get on your feet!

197
00:17:50,451 --> 00:17:53,488
I know you. You are Lee's
American friend, right?

198
00:17:53,588 --> 00:17:56,833
No. I'm Lee's new muscle.
Don't let this robe fool you.

199
00:17:56,933 --> 00:17:59,940
This is the only color they had left.
Now I said, get up.

200
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,055
I ain't gonna say it again.

201
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,830
You American are so funny.

202
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,203
And you Asians don't hear that well.

203
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,880
Little Ricky!

204
00:18:12,441 --> 00:18:15,277
Get your little punk ass up...

205
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:18,280
outta that chair right now!

206
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:22,984
You're messin' up my vacation.
Now, I told you to get up, didn't I?

207
00:18:23,384 --> 00:18:24,380
- Now I gotta go off on you.
- No!

208
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,724
- Let me bust his ass, Lee.
- Lee.

209
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:28,619
Let me take care of this.

210
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,450
Look, little man. You comin' with...
Oh, my Lord.

211
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,200
I would like to pay you for that laptop.

212
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,253
- I think I should do that.
- No problem.

213
00:18:55,353 --> 00:18:57,768
I can get you a new one. I seen it
on the internet, with a DVD player.

214
00:18:57,868 --> 00:19:02,041
- That's an old model.
- Now, I must excuse myself. Inspector.

215
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,222
Have a good day.

216
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,242
I was...

217
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,940
Lee, why didn't you tell me
this man rolls like this?

218
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,580
- I told you already!
- No, you didn't!

219
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,598
- I did. I did this.
- What you said?

220
00:19:18,698 --> 00:19:20,973
What do this mean? Speak English to me!

221
00:19:21,073 --> 00:19:23,180
That means I go this way
and you go this way.

222
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,630
- I go that way, you go this way?
- Yes.

223
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,596
Okay.

224
00:19:42,489 --> 00:19:43,603
- Sorry, man.
- Carter!

225
00:19:43,703 --> 00:19:46,222
All y'all look alike! Watch out!

226
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,367
- Carter!
- Lee!

227
00:20:15,312 --> 00:20:16,857
No wonder you mad.

228
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,426
Don't worry. It's okay.

229
00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:37,290
You better get the hell outta here.

230
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,554
Lee!

231
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,270
- Flip me!
- What?

232
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,117
Flip me!

233
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,490
Damn!

234
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,553
Lee!

235
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,240
No, no, no, no!

236
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,392
Lee!

237
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:49,904
Look, you've been ordered
by the Ministry of Public Security

238
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:53,932
to assist the F.B.I. and Secret Service
in our investigation,

239
00:21:54,032 --> 00:21:56,360
to provide us with whatever we need.

240
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,090
You have information, it belongs to us.

241
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,900
This is still Hong Kong.

242
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:06,930
Two Americans have been killed
on United States government property.

243
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:10,910
Give me two copies of that.
This is our investigation.

244
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:14,430
Chief Inspector Lee
will supervise your people.

245
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:18,738
No, he will report to me.
Do we understand each other?

246
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,707
What the hell is that?

247
00:22:26,807 --> 00:22:28,833
That is...

248
00:22:29,506 --> 00:22:31,230
Chief Inspector Lee.

249
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:35,745
I ain't never been humiliated and embarrassed
like that in my whole entire life.

250
00:22:35,845 --> 00:22:39,420
Got me runnin' around Hong Kong
butt-naked, thanks to you.

251
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,470
- Thanks to me?
- Yeah, thanks to you.

252
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,600
You needed backup, so I gave you backup.

253
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,046
I was about to kick Ricky Tan's ass,
and his bodyguards', till you messed it up.

254
00:22:47,146 --> 00:22:49,786
- Stop. I'm sick of your bullshit.
- I'm sick of you!

255
00:22:49,886 --> 00:22:52,606
I'm not the one runnin' up
in karaoke bars full of gangsters.

256
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:55,830
And I'm not the one runnin' up in massage
parlors lookin' for crime lords.

257
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:59,322
- It's my job.
- It's your job. You pitiful, man.

258
00:22:59,422 --> 00:23:02,332
When are you gonna have some fun?
When are you gonna take a day off?

259
00:23:02,432 --> 00:23:05,363
- When are you gonna go on a date?
- I have plenty of dates.

260
00:23:05,463 --> 00:23:07,643
When's the last time you had a date?

261
00:23:07,743 --> 00:23:10,416
When's the last time you played
"hide the rainbow roll"?

262
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:13,060
Let's hear it, Lee. The year of the rat?

263
00:23:13,636 --> 00:23:14,981
You will never understand me.

264
00:23:15,081 --> 00:23:18,374
You right, 'cause I didn't even understand
what you just said to me right then.

265
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,156
They got my passport
back at that massage parlor.

266
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:32,078
Good afternoon, sir.

267
00:23:32,178 --> 00:23:33,469
- Lee?
- Yes, sir.

268
00:23:33,569 --> 00:23:37,580
This is Special Agent Sterling
from the United States Secret Service.

269
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,556
- Secret Service? Why?
- Have a seat, please.

270
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,962
What I'm about to tell you
cannot leave this room.

271
00:23:46,962 --> 00:23:49,966
The men who were killed yesterday
were not American translators.

272
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,615
They were undercover
United States customs agents,

273
00:23:52,715 --> 00:23:55,877
- trying to break a triad smuggling ring.
- Smuggling what?

274
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:59,814
We don't know. But whatever it is,
it got the agents killed.

275
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,395
- How can we help you?
- You can stay the hell out of our way.

276
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:11,394
- Thank you.
- I can get you Ricky Tan.

277
00:24:11,494 --> 00:24:16,177
No. We know all about Tan. That's why
we're leaving him out there as bait.

278
00:24:16,877 --> 00:24:21,357
This is a lot bigger than Ricky Tan
and the Fu Cang Long Triads.

279
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,953
Hey, cutie.

280
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,200
Thank you, Lee.

281
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,495
Carter! Carter!

282
00:25:25,744 --> 00:25:28,349
Heaven on Earth massage parlor?

283
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,840
Heaven on Earth?

284
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:37,980
Hello. Cheap suits. Hello.
Cheap suits. Cheap suits.

285
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,340
- Cheap suits. Cheap suits.
- How cheap?

286
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,134
- Cheap suits.
- Cheap as hell?

287
00:25:59,841 --> 00:26:01,554
Excuse me.

288
00:26:01,654 --> 00:26:04,880
Can you direct me to Heaven on Earth
massage parlor, please?

289
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,390
- Hello. How are you?
- Okay.

290
00:26:09,566 --> 00:26:11,676
No, no. Wait a minute.

291
00:26:12,076 --> 00:26:14,136
I don't want no chicken.

292
00:26:15,396 --> 00:26:17,981
No, no, no. No!

293
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:21,140
I don't want no chicken.
What am I gonna do with a chicken?

294
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,081
I don't like my chickens live, okay?

295
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:26,884
I like 'em dead and deep-fried.
You ever heard of Popeye's?

296
00:26:28,204 --> 00:26:31,370
No, no! No! Don't kill chicken.

297
00:26:32,517 --> 00:26:33,970
Yes.

298
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,827
I'm warning you. I'm a police officer.

299
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,524
Put the blade down
and let the bird go right now!

300
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:49,026
You okay, Lee?

301
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:54,298
All he wanted was some mu shu.

302
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,103
Damn.

303
00:27:12,034 --> 00:27:14,170
Hey, taxi! Taxi!

304
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:16,700
Hey! Hey!

305
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,353
Follow that car.

306
00:27:19,653 --> 00:27:23,187
Hey, follow that limo.
This is a chase, okay?

307
00:27:23,287 --> 00:27:25,260
Wherever he goes, you go.

308
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,040
You're not movin'!
This is the opposite of chasin'!

309
00:27:29,294 --> 00:27:32,400
What? I will slap you
if you don't move this car.

310
00:27:32,921 --> 00:27:35,341
I'm gonna slap you. I'm gonna slap you.

311
00:27:35,441 --> 00:27:38,112
Okay. All right. Okay, look.

312
00:27:38,212 --> 00:27:40,468
Here. You understand that?

313
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:48,334
- Now you're speaking my language.
- Get the hell on then. Come on, let's go!

314
00:27:56,934 --> 00:27:58,259
<i>Yeah</i>

315
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:03,072
<i>This right here, tell you what
Goes out to everyone</i>

316
00:28:03,572 --> 00:28:05,469
<i>That has lost someone</i>

317
00:28:05,569 --> 00:28:07,593
<i>That they truly loved
Come on, check it out</i>

318
00:28:07,693 --> 00:28:10,149
<i>Seems like yesterday
we used to rock the show</i>

319
00:28:10,249 --> 00:28:12,099
<i>I laced the track, you locked the flow</i>

320
00:28:12,199 --> 00:28:14,504
<i>We're so far from hangin'
on the block for dough</i>

321
00:28:14,604 --> 00:28:16,700
<i>Notorious, they got to know that</i>

322
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,883
<i>Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me</i>

323
00:28:20,983 --> 00:28:23,197
<i>Even though you're gone we still a team</i>

324
00:28:23,297 --> 00:28:25,416
<i>Through your family,
I'll fulfill your dreams</i>

325
00:28:25,516 --> 00:28:28,997
<i>In the future can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me</i>

326
00:28:29,097 --> 00:28:31,921
<i>Reminisce sometime
the night they took my friend</i>

327
00:28:32,021 --> 00:28:34,705
<i>I try to black it out
but it plays again...</i>

328
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:20,527
Wait right here. I'll be right back.
You understand?

329
00:29:20,627 --> 00:29:22,731
Yes, I understand!

330
00:29:22,831 --> 00:29:25,300
- And don't eat my chicken, okay?
- Okay, okay.

331
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,905
- Okay.
- Okay. Jesus!

332
00:29:28,005 --> 00:29:30,118
Hey! Hey!

333
00:30:51,187 --> 00:30:56,065
How you doin', baby?
Carter, James Carter. Baldwin Hills.

334
00:30:56,165 --> 00:31:00,645
- Isabella Molina. From San Juan.
- San Juan? I know San Juan.

335
00:31:00,745 --> 00:31:03,637
I've traveled there many times
on my private plane.

336
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:08,890
You must know my good friend Pedro Morales
Magonzales Marato Molaso Mondustos.

337
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,226
- I don't think so, no.
- You sure?

338
00:31:11,376 --> 00:31:14,132
Well, I'm sorry. I thought
you rode in the best of circles.

339
00:31:14,232 --> 00:31:19,161
But listen. Make yourself feel at home.
You need anything... champagne, caviar...

340
00:31:19,261 --> 00:31:20,706
My yacht is your yacht.

341
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:25,550
- This is your yacht?
- That's right. I'm the owner.

342
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,370
The captain. <i>El capitán.</i>

343
00:31:28,794 --> 00:31:31,600
- <i>El captán?</i>
- Yes. Listen...

344
00:31:31,934 --> 00:31:35,511
I'm not gonna play games with you.
I want you right now.

345
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:40,507
I see me and you downstairs in one
of those bathrooms in about five minutes.

346
00:31:40,807 --> 00:31:44,853
Well, I'm very tempted.
It's such a beautiful yacht.

347
00:31:46,164 --> 00:31:47,448
What's it called?

348
00:31:47,548 --> 00:31:50,510
- What's it called?
- Your yacht.

349
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,170
The S.S. Minnow Johnson.

350
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,758
- The S.S. Minnow Johnson?
- Yeah.

351
00:31:54,858 --> 00:31:57,440
Funny. The name on the back
was the Red Dragon.

352
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,046
- The Red Dragon? Are you sure?
- Oh, I'm sure.

353
00:32:01,146 --> 00:32:02,939
Because this is my friend's yacht.

354
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,024
- Your friend's yacht?
- And this is his party.

355
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:08,947
I must've got on the wrong yacht.
All these yachts look just alike these days.

356
00:32:09,047 --> 00:32:12,190
I knew somethin' was wrong
when my key didn't work.

357
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,457
- Who's your friend?
- Somebody who got on the wrong yacht.

358
00:32:16,557 --> 00:32:19,380
Hey, wait a second. I know you.
Steven Reign, right?

359
00:32:19,601 --> 00:32:22,947
You own half of Los Angeles.
What you doin' out here in Hong Kong?

360
00:32:23,047 --> 00:32:24,983
I'm here for the weekend,
taking in the sights.

361
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:28,230
You must have your own plane too.
It's fun, ain't it?

362
00:32:29,022 --> 00:32:31,560
- Shall we?
- Yes.

363
00:32:32,292 --> 00:32:36,660
- Well, enjoy the party, Mr. Carter.
- I plan to, Ms. Isabella.

364
00:32:37,308 --> 00:32:40,184
See you later, Stevie. Be cool.

365
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,786
- Ricky Tan. Where is he?
- I don't know!

366
00:32:56,886 --> 00:32:59,470
He killed a detective today.
Where is he?

367
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,140
Who got killed, man?

368
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,635
- Carter!
- Who died, Lee?

369
00:33:05,035 --> 00:33:06,787
- You!
- Detective Yu?

370
00:33:06,887 --> 00:33:08,924
- Not Yu, you!
- Who?

371
00:33:09,024 --> 00:33:11,325
- You!
- Who?

372
00:33:11,425 --> 00:33:14,261
Do you understand the words
that are coming out of my mouth?

373
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:17,440
Don't nobody understand the words
that are comin' out of your mouth, man.

374
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,554
Ricky Tan is waiting for you.

375
00:33:26,132 --> 00:33:28,306
What the hell is going on here, Lee?

376
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:30,419
Remember I told you
my father was a policeman?

377
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:32,326
- Yeah.
- Ricky Tan was his partner.

378
00:33:32,426 --> 00:33:33,315
What?

379
00:33:54,505 --> 00:33:58,725
Lee, I've been expecting you.
Please ask your partner to wait inside.

380
00:33:58,825 --> 00:34:01,323
- Hell, no. I ain't goin' nowhere.
- It's okay.

381
00:34:01,423 --> 00:34:03,980
- I'm not leavin' you alone, Lee.
- I'll be fine.

382
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,550
- You sure?
- Yes.

383
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,864
I'll be right upstairs.

384
00:34:12,687 --> 00:34:14,866
I know what everybody's saying.

385
00:34:14,966 --> 00:34:17,780
I did not blow up the American embassy.

386
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,815
I'm not that stupid.

387
00:34:21,158 --> 00:34:23,960
But I believe some of my people did.

388
00:34:24,767 --> 00:34:27,313
My enemies are trying to frame me.

389
00:34:27,413 --> 00:34:31,318
There is a war going on
right now within the Triads.

390
00:34:32,573 --> 00:34:35,420
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose this time.

391
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,470
If your father were still alive,
I would turn to him for advice.

392
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:41,102
Please don't.

393
00:34:41,202 --> 00:34:44,787
Lee, I really need your help.
I cannot trust anybody else.

394
00:34:45,187 --> 00:34:47,500
Tell me why they killed
the customs agents.

395
00:34:48,047 --> 00:34:50,423
I'll give you all the information
you need,

396
00:34:50,523 --> 00:34:54,524
but you've gotta get me
out of Hong Kong right away.

397
00:35:36,864 --> 00:35:40,025
Hey, lady, what are you doin'?
Get down. I'm L.A.P.D.

398
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:46,334
You just kick me?
You must be outta your mind!

399
00:35:46,434 --> 00:35:49,784
You want some of me? I'm gonna
give you an L.A.P.D. ass-kickin'!

400
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:20,002
- You okay?
- Yeah. I slipped and I fell.

401
00:36:20,402 --> 00:36:21,504
- Hey.
- What?

402
00:36:21,604 --> 00:36:23,582
Am I bleedin'?

403
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,898
Quite a night, Inspector.

404
00:36:38,998 --> 00:36:42,217
Ricky Tan was our only bait.
Now he's gone.

405
00:36:42,317 --> 00:36:44,021
So you got your revenge...

406
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:46,890
at the expense of a United States
government investigation.

407
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,591
Revenge? What are you talkin' about?

408
00:36:48,691 --> 00:36:51,744
Now, I don't know if the Triads
paid you to get rid of Tan

409
00:36:51,844 --> 00:36:54,157
or if it was a pure vendetta killing

410
00:36:54,257 --> 00:36:56,758
or if you're involved
in the smuggling yourself,

411
00:36:56,858 --> 00:37:00,185
but you're off this case. I don't ever
wanna see you again. Is that clear?

412
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:03,100
- Hey, what's goin' on here?
- Carter, you're in enough trouble.

413
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,009
Just shut up. Stay out of it.

414
00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:08,112
You're goin' back to L.A. right now.

415
00:37:08,312 --> 00:37:11,840
Hey, that's fine with me, man.
I ain't had fun since I been out here.

416
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,548
Okay.

417
00:37:16,315 --> 00:37:17,810
Sorry, Lee.

418
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:23,009
- Escort Detective Carter to the airport.
- No.

419
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,666
- I'll take him.
- Get your hands off!

420
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:38,450
- Carter, you don't understand.
- Oh, I understand, all right.

421
00:37:38,779 --> 00:37:42,619
I got knocked off a building,
I got beat on, I got stripped butt-naked,

422
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:46,422
and you held out on me, man.
I'm outta here.

423
00:37:53,385 --> 00:37:56,404
Carter, Ricky Tan set up my father.

424
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:59,619
What?

425
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:08,438
Five years ago, my father was working
a big international smuggling case.

426
00:38:08,538 --> 00:38:11,751
He found out his partner, Tan,
was working for the Triads.

427
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:15,591
But before he could prove it,
he was killed.

428
00:38:16,031 --> 00:38:20,230
All the evidence disappeared, Tan resigned,
and the case was never solved.

429
00:38:22,351 --> 00:38:24,844
So I get it now. This is all
about your daddy's last case.

430
00:38:30,445 --> 00:38:32,261
So you gettin' on the plane
with me or not?

431
00:38:32,661 --> 00:38:36,371
- What?
- You know my daddy died on the job too.

432
00:38:36,471 --> 00:38:39,675
If I had a chance to square his death,
I'd do whatever it took.

433
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,904
I'd do anything. So you comin' or what?

434
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,144
Why L.A.?

435
00:38:53,661 --> 00:38:57,509
Lee, let me introduce you to Carter's
theory of criminal investigation:

436
00:38:57,609 --> 00:38:59,411
follow the rich white man.

437
00:38:59,511 --> 00:39:02,853
- Follow the rich white man?
- Exactly. Now you're learning.

438
00:39:02,953 --> 00:39:06,487
Every big crime has a rich white man
behind it waitin' for his cut.

439
00:39:06,587 --> 00:39:09,878
Now in our case, we know
who the rich white man is. Steven Reign.

440
00:39:09,978 --> 00:39:10,913
Who?

441
00:39:11,013 --> 00:39:14,193
Steven Reign, the hotel billionaire.
I saw him on Ricky Tan's boat.

442
00:39:14,293 --> 00:39:16,307
When the shootin' started,
he was way too cool.

443
00:39:16,407 --> 00:39:18,997
I'm gonna tell you somethin'. When people
start shootin', white people ain't that cool.

444
00:39:19,097 --> 00:39:22,593
They either runnin' around,
hidin' behind tables, or screamin' like...

445
00:39:24,772 --> 00:39:26,311
You sound like that all the time.

446
00:39:26,411 --> 00:39:28,255
Let me tell you somethin'
about black people.

447
00:39:28,355 --> 00:39:30,911
When stuff goes down, we keep our cool.

448
00:39:31,011 --> 00:39:34,304
Maybe, but not like Asians,
we never panic.

449
00:39:34,404 --> 00:39:37,839
Yeah, right. When godzilla's comin',
y'all be trippin'. I seen the movie.

450
00:39:37,939 --> 00:39:39,792
- You be, "gaica, gaica!"
- Carter.

451
00:39:39,892 --> 00:39:43,456
- Yellin' everywhere. I seen Chinamen...
- Mr. Carter, excuse me.

452
00:39:43,556 --> 00:39:46,756
- Thank you so much. It's the kosher meal?
- Yes, sir, that is our kosher meal.

453
00:39:46,856 --> 00:39:48,514
Shalom.

454
00:40:02,413 --> 00:40:03,728
There he is, right there.

455
00:40:03,828 --> 00:40:08,194
Mr. Steven Reign, livin' large
in one of his penthouse suites.

456
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,722
Oh, guess who this is. Yep, that's her.

457
00:40:13,822 --> 00:40:16,707
That's the woman that was
on Ricky Tan's boat, right there.

458
00:40:16,807 --> 00:40:18,401
We got 'em.

459
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:21,244
Told you it'd work out.
Know what I'm talkin' about.

460
00:40:21,344 --> 00:40:23,510
All we gotta do now is wait.

461
00:40:24,671 --> 00:40:26,167
They still talkin'?

462
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,114
- He's leaving.
- He'll be back.

463
00:40:30,214 --> 00:40:33,390
- How do you know?
- I know. You see how fine that woman is?

464
00:40:33,622 --> 00:40:35,633
He'll definitely be back.

465
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:43,747
What's she doing?

466
00:40:46,984 --> 00:40:48,539
What's she doin', man?

467
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:51,440
She's just standing around,
not doing much.

468
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:55,253
Well, just don't fall asleep.
Sooner or later, something's gonna happen.

469
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:59,785
Okay, I just try to stay awake.
It's just so boring.

470
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:07,790
- Slow down, baby.
- What?

471
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,915
- Nothing. I said nothing.
- You said somethin'.

472
00:41:12,015 --> 00:41:13,805
- I said nothing.
- I heard you say somethin'.

473
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:15,973
No. Noth... nothing.

474
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:30,408
Lee, what's goin' on, man?
What you talkin' about?

475
00:41:30,508 --> 00:41:33,433
- She's getting undressed.
- What?

476
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:35,320
- She's just getting undressed.
- Give me that!

477
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,975
No!

478
00:41:37,075 --> 00:41:38,888
It's not right!

479
00:41:39,522 --> 00:41:41,247
- Lord, have mercy!
- What?

480
00:41:41,347 --> 00:41:44,260
- She took her skirt off.
- Oh, I... I cannot hear this.

481
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:47,436
Black panties, black bra...

482
00:41:47,536 --> 00:41:52,595
Victoria's Secret, spring catalog,
page 27. Girl got class.

483
00:41:52,995 --> 00:41:55,541
Let me look a little closer.
Oh, look at that.

484
00:41:55,641 --> 00:41:59,970
Got a little tattoo. That's cute.
Looks like... Snoopy.

485
00:42:00,164 --> 00:42:01,830
- Snoopy? I love Snoopy.
- Yeah.

486
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:04,797
Wait a minute. I love Snoopy too.
Let me look at this thing.

487
00:42:05,497 --> 00:42:06,796
Hold up. Wait a minute.

488
00:42:06,896 --> 00:42:10,681
She's goin' to the door. Wait a minute,
wait a minute. She's goin' to the door.

489
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:12,924
She's openin' the door.

490
00:42:14,067 --> 00:42:16,715
Look like somebody
droppin' off a package.

491
00:42:16,815 --> 00:42:18,660
Wait a minute.

492
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:22,120
Look like the same girl who dropped off
the package at your office.

493
00:42:22,919 --> 00:42:24,101
- It's a bomb!
- Bomb!

494
00:42:25,329 --> 00:42:27,334
Watch out! Watch out!

495
00:42:32,014 --> 00:42:35,259
It's this one right here, I think.
Hey, lady, you got a bomb in there!

496
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,750
Open that door! Kick the door.

497
00:42:39,694 --> 00:42:41,643
- What the...
- No, no, no, no!

498
00:42:41,743 --> 00:42:44,400
- Damn, you fine.
- Carter!

499
00:42:45,365 --> 00:42:47,534
- Come on, Lee! Come on!
- Where?

500
00:42:47,634 --> 00:42:50,887
- Don't drop it! Come on, this way!
- Where should we go?

501
00:42:53,933 --> 00:42:57,100
- <i>Bájate! Bájate, señora!</i>
- Roof! Roof!

502
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,214
Don't trip! Be careful!

503
00:43:02,545 --> 00:43:04,401
- Throw it, Lee!
- Where?

504
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:05,645
- Lee, throw it!
- Where?

505
00:43:05,745 --> 00:43:08,246
Throw the bomb over the edge! Throw it!

506
00:43:08,546 --> 00:43:11,334
- Throw it! Throw it over the edge!
- No, there's people down there!

507
00:43:11,434 --> 00:43:14,050
- Lee, throw it! Lee!
- Carter! Carter!

508
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:16,387
- Lee! Throw it!
- Carter! No!

509
00:43:16,487 --> 00:43:18,693
We about to die!

510
00:43:25,818 --> 00:43:28,266
Okay, get on your feet.

511
00:43:28,366 --> 00:43:30,163
- Enough, all right?
- Put that down!

512
00:43:30,263 --> 00:43:31,931
- It's a bomb! Hey!
- Put that down!

513
00:43:32,031 --> 00:43:35,023
Guys, no bomb. Nothing.

514
00:43:35,123 --> 00:43:38,708
Now stay away before I throw you
both in jail for obstruction.

515
00:43:38,808 --> 00:43:41,090
Throw us in jail?

516
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:43,610
You must be outta your mind.
I'm about to bust you right now.

517
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:46,474
I'm an undercover agent
for the United States Secret Service.

518
00:43:46,574 --> 00:43:49,490
How do we know that?
Show me a badge right now.

519
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:50,680
Here you go.

520
00:43:53,173 --> 00:43:56,270
Let me see that again.
I didn't get a good look at that.

521
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:59,168
We can help you.
I'm a detective from Hong Kong.

522
00:43:59,268 --> 00:44:01,800
I know who you are,
Inspector Lee. I know.

523
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,344
We need to go out of sight,
so come down to my suite.

524
00:44:08,489 --> 00:44:10,773
- Now why did you say it was a bomb?
- No, you said that.

525
00:44:10,873 --> 00:44:13,120
- No, you said it.
- You said that in the hotel room.

526
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,610
I said she was the bomb.

527
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:18,768
She was the bomb?

528
00:44:19,218 --> 00:44:21,704
Look, I've been working
this case for months now,

529
00:44:21,804 --> 00:44:25,508
- So if I seem aggravated, I apologize.
- You need to tell us what's goin' on.

530
00:44:25,608 --> 00:44:28,582
The Triads and Reign, they think
I'm a crooked customs agent.

531
00:44:28,682 --> 00:44:32,564
- Is that a payoff?
- No. That's a sample.

532
00:44:32,664 --> 00:44:35,312
- You guys ever heard of the superbill?
- I heard of it. It's a myth.

533
00:44:35,412 --> 00:44:40,114
- Some kind of counterfeit.
- Honey, it's much more than a counterfeit.

534
00:44:40,214 --> 00:44:43,350
Fourteen out of fifteen world banks
can't even tell the difference.

535
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:47,818
The paper is crane linen blend, and the bills
are printed on U.S. intaglio presses.

536
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:50,778
You wanna tell us how in the world they get
into the U.S. mint to use the presses?

537
00:44:50,878 --> 00:44:54,769
In 1959, the United States
was very friendly with the shah of Iran.

538
00:44:54,969 --> 00:44:57,326
Why? Because we wanted his oil.

539
00:44:57,426 --> 00:44:59,079
Our government gave him a gift.

540
00:44:59,179 --> 00:45:03,397
A U.S. treasury intaglio printing press.
It's the only one to ever leave the country.

541
00:45:03,497 --> 00:45:06,339
Five years ago, Ricky Tan bought
the press on the black market.

542
00:45:06,439 --> 00:45:10,246
Five years ago?
That's right before he left the force.

543
00:45:10,346 --> 00:45:14,047
Earlier this year, he got a hold of one-
of-a-kind Swiss-made hundred-dollar plates,

544
00:45:14,147 --> 00:45:16,059
and he started printing superbills.

545
00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:19,391
That's why Hu Li killed him...
for the plates.

546
00:45:19,491 --> 00:45:23,568
And they've printed and shipped
one hundred million dollars.

547
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:28,415
There's only one way to spot a fake.

548
00:45:28,815 --> 00:45:32,464
They use an optical transfer ink
from India that burns red. You see?

549
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:36,374
Now, the real ink... it burns black.

550
00:45:36,474 --> 00:45:39,757
So what in the hell they gonna do
with $100 million of phony money?

551
00:45:39,857 --> 00:45:42,926
You know, Carter, I believe
you're asking the wrong question.

552
00:45:43,426 --> 00:45:46,851
The real question is...
where are the plates?

553
00:45:46,951 --> 00:45:50,304
Because if we can find the plates,
we can stop the whole operation.

554
00:45:50,404 --> 00:45:53,220
- Right?
- Yeah, you're right.

555
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:56,082
Maybe this is where
you can help us, guys.

556
00:45:56,182 --> 00:45:59,393
Yeah. I mean, Carter,
this is your city, right?

557
00:45:59,493 --> 00:46:02,409
Yeah, this is my titty.
I mean, this is my city.

558
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:06,521
Great. And Lee, you know Hu Li
and the Triads, correct?

559
00:46:06,621 --> 00:46:10,447
- Yes.
- Great. So can you do me a favor?

560
00:46:10,547 --> 00:46:12,817
Can you find out where Hu Li's
keeping the plates?

561
00:46:13,217 --> 00:46:15,447
- That ain't no problem.
- Thank you.

562
00:46:15,547 --> 00:46:18,168
So welcome aboard, gentlemen.
From this moment on,

563
00:46:18,268 --> 00:46:22,187
you're officially working
for the United States Secret Service.

564
00:46:23,964 --> 00:46:28,226
Secret Service Agent James Carter.
Oh, that sounds good.

565
00:46:28,326 --> 00:46:31,766
It's got a nice ring to it, don't it?
I'm tellin' you, Lee, give me six months.

566
00:46:31,866 --> 00:46:35,643
Six months and I'm gonna be in
Washington, D.C., protectin' the president.

567
00:46:35,743 --> 00:46:38,457
We both know you would never take
a bullet for someone else.

568
00:46:38,557 --> 00:46:40,171
Yeah, but they don't know that.

569
00:46:40,271 --> 00:46:42,570
I'm gonna talk to Isabella,
see if she can hook somethin' up.

570
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:44,458
Seein' the way she was starin'
at a brother.

571
00:46:44,558 --> 00:46:47,082
She never even look at you.

572
00:46:47,182 --> 00:46:49,673
Just jealous, Lee,
'cause the girl chose me,

573
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:53,379
'cause I'm tall, dark and handsome,
and you third-world ugly.

574
00:46:53,479 --> 00:46:58,804
I'm not third-world ugly. Women like me.
They think I'm cute, like Snoopy.

575
00:46:58,904 --> 00:47:01,774
Lee, Snoopy is six inches
taller than you.

576
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:05,801
<i>Sterling.</i>

577
00:47:05,901 --> 00:47:11,036
Lee and Carter are officially out
of the Secret Service's way. Correct.

578
00:47:29,747 --> 00:47:33,191
This is my informant's place.
They got pretty good ribs here too.

579
00:47:33,291 --> 00:47:35,379
I like kosher.

580
00:47:43,898 --> 00:47:45,964
Hey. Hey, wait.

581
00:47:53,315 --> 00:47:56,661
Oh, I know I don't think I see
what I see what I'm thinkin'!

582
00:47:56,761 --> 00:47:59,194
I know good and well
y'all ain't gamblin' back here!

583
00:47:59,294 --> 00:48:02,311
- This is supposed to be a Chinese restaurant!
- What you doin' in here, James?

584
00:48:02,411 --> 00:48:05,602
You about to go to jail. You about
to go to jail, and all your little friends.

585
00:48:05,702 --> 00:48:08,060
Everybody pack up your stuff
and let's get outta here. Let's go!

586
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,092
- Let's talk outside.
- You wanna talk outside?

587
00:48:10,192 --> 00:48:12,565
- Yes.
- Let's go then. You wanna talk.

588
00:48:12,665 --> 00:48:14,321
As long as you wanna talk.

589
00:48:17,924 --> 00:48:22,165
Where you get that from? I like that.
That's good. What's up, Kenny?

590
00:48:23,221 --> 00:48:25,648
- James Carter.
- What's up?

591
00:48:25,748 --> 00:48:28,995
What's up is I heard you was gettin' your
ass kicked out there in Hong Kong, brother.

592
00:48:29,095 --> 00:48:31,368
- What?
- That's right.

593
00:48:31,468 --> 00:48:34,507
- You crazy. Who told you that?
- I got my sources. Don't worry about that.

594
00:48:34,607 --> 00:48:36,154
They tellin' you lies.

595
00:48:36,254 --> 00:48:38,679
Look, man. I'm about to bust you
if you don't give me some information.

596
00:48:38,779 --> 00:48:42,085
How you gonna come up here
and jam me up like this, James?

597
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:46,073
You embarrass me in front of my wife,
my kids out there.

598
00:48:46,373 --> 00:48:47,943
Kenny, you embarrassin' yourself.

599
00:48:48,043 --> 00:48:50,954
You a black man
with a Chinese restaurant on Crenshaw.

600
00:48:51,054 --> 00:48:53,901
You come up in here,
you ain't show me no badge.

601
00:48:54,001 --> 00:48:56,144
You ain't even flashed a warrant.

602
00:48:56,244 --> 00:49:00,334
Know what I'm gonna do for you?
I'm gonna whup your ass.

603
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:05,080
- And then I'm gonna whup your ass.
- Kenny, we'd love to see that. We would.

604
00:49:05,529 --> 00:49:08,125
- Come on, Kenny! Come on, Kenny!
- Come on! Do it!

605
00:49:08,225 --> 00:49:11,530
I'll shoot you and say you fell in
the kitchen. You better chill out, boy.

606
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:14,944
- Kenny, calm down, Kenny!
- Hey, what...

607
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:20,857
Kenny!

608
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:26,974
Twisting tiger.

609
00:49:30,292 --> 00:49:31,644
Where did you learn that?

610
00:49:39,207 --> 00:49:42,434
- They're brothers.
- Oh, all right, all right.

611
00:49:45,496 --> 00:49:46,884
7-11?

612
00:49:51,385 --> 00:49:55,531
Hey! I heard that. I heard that.

613
00:49:55,631 --> 00:49:57,634
Don't be talkin' about me, man.

614
00:49:57,734 --> 00:49:59,788
You guys are here
about some funny money?

615
00:49:59,888 --> 00:50:02,025
- How you know?
- C-notes, right?

616
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:04,993
Yeah. Any of 'em came through here?

617
00:50:06,963 --> 00:50:08,691
One of my regulars came in here
a few days ago,

618
00:50:08,791 --> 00:50:11,611
dropped about 50 large
on the tables in there.

619
00:50:11,711 --> 00:50:14,569
I was about to go down there
with my boys and tune his ass up,

620
00:50:14,769 --> 00:50:16,673
But he comes in the next day
with the whole thing.

621
00:50:16,773 --> 00:50:19,650
Brand-new one hundred
dollar bills, sequential.

622
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,576
Now, I figure they're fake,
'cause this guy's got a regular dayjob.

623
00:50:22,676 --> 00:50:26,360
- So I test 'em, and they checked out.
- You still have the bills?

624
00:50:27,588 --> 00:50:29,768
Still got my lunch money
from the third grade.

625
00:50:29,868 --> 00:50:31,184
Let me see 'em.

626
00:50:55,003 --> 00:50:57,390
Hold it. What are you doin'?

627
00:51:03,649 --> 00:51:07,362
It's fake. He got you.
Who you say gave that to you?

628
00:51:07,462 --> 00:51:09,836
Cat named Zing.
Work down at Reign Plaza.

629
00:51:09,936 --> 00:51:12,420
Tell you what: you better hope
you find him before I do.

630
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,174
All right.

631
00:51:37,345 --> 00:51:39,209
Excuse me.

632
00:51:39,731 --> 00:51:42,814
L.A.P.D. We're lookin'
for a guy named Zing.

633
00:51:45,078 --> 00:51:47,270
- You!
- Come here! Come back here!

634
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:50,222
Hey! Hey! You little rascal!

635
00:51:50,322 --> 00:51:52,183
Get back here!

636
00:51:52,283 --> 00:51:54,053
Get back here right now!

637
00:52:13,373 --> 00:52:17,513
You know what? I don't even know
why the hell I'm here. I ain't even Chinese.

638
00:52:17,613 --> 00:52:19,790
All right, I'm sorry.

639
00:52:21,298 --> 00:52:24,265
I think there's someone
who would like to talk to them first.

640
00:52:34,231 --> 00:52:37,284
What'd you do that for?
That was unnecessary!

641
00:52:41,977 --> 00:52:44,657
You done knocked out my filling, girl.
That's gonna cost you.

642
00:52:48,531 --> 00:52:51,643
I ain't never hit a woman in my life,
but your ass is pushin' it!

643
00:52:55,155 --> 00:52:58,378
Okay, all right, all right. I'll go.

644
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:03,234
Better watch your back.

645
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:40,492
Lee. Lee!

646
00:53:41,182 --> 00:53:42,406
What happened?

647
00:53:42,506 --> 00:53:45,617
That lady Isabella knock you out,
that's what happened. She played you.

648
00:53:45,717 --> 00:53:47,103
- No.
- Yes, she did.

649
00:53:47,203 --> 00:53:49,048
- She save our life.
- What?

650
00:53:49,148 --> 00:53:51,733
- Hu Li could have killed us.
- Are you crazy, man?

651
00:53:51,833 --> 00:53:55,566
- Look at us. We good as dead!
- Stop your whining, Carter!

652
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:59,340
What you gonna do if I don't stop?
I will slap the hell outta you right now.

653
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,596
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

654
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:05,306
- I'll bitch-slap you back to Africa!
- Oh, you will? Come on, let me see that.

655
00:54:05,406 --> 00:54:09,726
I wanna see you do that! You don't know
who you're messin' with, man!

656
00:54:09,826 --> 00:54:11,889
You don't know who
you're messin' with, do you?

657
00:54:11,989 --> 00:54:15,034
- I'll bite your damn nose off, man.
- You bite... come on!

658
00:54:49,073 --> 00:54:50,829
Some apple?

659
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:56,078
I'd put that knife away, bitch,
before you have an accident.

660
00:55:05,801 --> 00:55:07,748
Ain't no use, man.

661
00:55:08,448 --> 00:55:10,943
Just tell me how the Triads
are gonna kill us.

662
00:55:11,043 --> 00:55:13,763
They will torture us for three days.

663
00:55:13,863 --> 00:55:18,229
- I can handle that.
- Then they'll cut off our egg rolls.

664
00:55:18,329 --> 00:55:22,117
Cut off our egg rolls? Hell, no!
Let's get the hell outta here!

665
00:55:22,217 --> 00:55:24,056
Come on, man! Don't give up!

666
00:55:32,005 --> 00:55:35,030
- I don't wanna die!
- Be quiet.

667
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:38,685
- Okay, give me your left leg.
- What for?

668
00:55:38,785 --> 00:55:41,800
Left leg! Like this.

669
00:55:43,868 --> 00:55:46,224
- Hold tight.
- Okay.

670
00:55:56,938 --> 00:56:01,162
That's it. Bite that thing.
Bite it! Bite it like a little monkey!

671
00:56:01,262 --> 00:56:05,756
Go on, bite it! There you go.
Yank it! Use them tiger teeth!

672
00:56:05,856 --> 00:56:09,980
Yeah! Grab it! Pull on it!
You almost got it. That's it.

673
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:12,477
Oh, shit!

674
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,923
What the hell?

675
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:18,480
Lee, untie me. Hurry up, man!

676
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:21,334
All these statues full of money.

677
00:56:30,363 --> 00:56:32,661
Hello, Benjamin!

678
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:38,310
- What are you doing?
- I'm takin' this for evidence.

679
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:41,692
Carter.

680
00:56:42,492 --> 00:56:46,061
- You feel that?
- Yeah, we slowin' down, man.

681
00:57:01,061 --> 00:57:03,924
- What happened?
- I'll tell you what happened.

682
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,835
Come on, Lee!

683
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:14,517
Carter, go up.

684
00:57:20,612 --> 00:57:23,204
Carter! Carter!

685
00:57:42,158 --> 00:57:44,516
- Carter!
- Lee!

686
00:57:45,116 --> 00:57:46,740
- What happened?
- You left me.

687
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,084
I didn't leave you, man.
I was waitin' up there for you.

688
00:58:04,829 --> 00:58:06,761
- Man! I ain't goin' in there!
- Come on!

689
00:58:06,861 --> 00:58:09,023
- There's rats in there!
- There's no rats!

690
00:58:09,123 --> 00:58:10,979
Look at that rat!

691
00:58:32,505 --> 00:58:33,620
Las Vegas?

692
00:58:34,614 --> 00:58:38,474
Vegas? What the hell we doin' in Vegas?

693
00:58:38,574 --> 00:58:41,211
Look. Red Dragon.

694
00:58:41,311 --> 00:58:43,890
That's the name of Ricky Tan's boat.

695
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:45,630
Lee.

696
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:49,360
That's how you launder
$100 million in cash.

697
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,885
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

698
00:58:51,985 --> 00:58:53,527
- Sorry.
- Damn!

699
00:58:53,627 --> 00:58:56,094
One at a time.
What the hell is wrong with you?

700
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:02,370
- Wait a second, man.
- What?

701
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:04,330
- We can't go in there like this.
- Why?

702
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:06,663
- We got to look fly.
- What mean "fly"?

703
00:59:06,763 --> 00:59:08,580
We got to mack out, man.
We can't go in there like this.

704
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,210
What does it mean, "mack out"?

705
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:15,584
Follow me, my Asian brother.
I'll show you. Come on. Come on.

706
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:24,120
That's where we're going, right there.

707
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:26,610
When we get in there,
you stay a couple steps behind me.

708
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:30,640
You smell a little funky.
I think you stepped in some rat shit.

709
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:34,080
It was a cowboy hat,
and now it's a pith helmet.

710
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:36,534
Hold on. Talk to you in a bit.

711
00:59:36,634 --> 00:59:38,090
Hi, nice to see you.
Can I help you, gentlemen?

712
00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:41,096
Yeah, I'm gonna need black, 42 long,

713
00:59:41,196 --> 00:59:43,352
and nothin' touches this body
but pure silk.

714
00:59:43,452 --> 00:59:45,904
And get my partner
somethin' from the kids' department.

715
00:59:46,004 --> 00:59:48,201
Would your partner like
to be wrapped in silk as well?

716
00:59:48,301 --> 00:59:51,700
Some people think it's tacky, but I really
enjoy it when couples dress alike.

717
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,861
No, this ain't no couple thing, man.
We're police officers.

718
00:59:54,961 --> 00:59:56,860
We're workin' a dangerous case,
and we need some clothes.

719
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,895
- Yes. There are a lot of men chasing us.
- As well they should be.

720
00:59:59,995 --> 01:00:01,800
Listen, you have nothing
to worry about, okay?

721
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,894
Because I'm gonna turn you two
into the belle of the ball.

722
01:00:03,994 --> 01:00:05,303
- Thank you.
- Absolutely.

723
01:00:05,403 --> 01:00:06,848
Let's start with you, shall we?

724
01:00:06,948 --> 01:00:09,094
You've got the mochaccino face,
wonderful skin,

725
01:00:09,194 --> 01:00:12,036
and the big, broad shoulders, okay?
Let's put a dead animal on you.

726
01:00:12,336 --> 01:00:15,240
Croc skin. Butter cream, butter cream,
croc skin, butter cream...

727
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:17,723
What size is the waist?
Let's go in. I wanna...

728
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:20,383
Hey! Watch it, sweetness!

729
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:22,250
- He's got some fire to him.
- Honey cups!

730
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:24,440
- I like that.
- Go get the clothes! Hurry up!

731
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:28,753
I'll pull some items. Oh, Jesus.
Lil Kim, I'll be back.

732
01:00:29,527 --> 01:00:32,250
- You see that?
- He likes you.

733
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:35,034
I'm not shoppin' with you no more.

734
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:44,990
Act like you're rich.

735
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:48,530
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Steven Reign,</i>

736
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:53,444
<i>owner and founder
of the Red Dragon Casino.</i>

737
01:00:53,629 --> 01:00:55,373
Thank you.

738
01:00:58,330 --> 01:01:00,178
Thank you.

739
01:01:00,278 --> 01:01:01,681
Good evening.

740
01:01:01,781 --> 01:01:05,410
A thousand years ago, a small,
wealthy village in China,

741
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:09,274
hired a young dragon
to guard their treasures in a cave.

742
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:12,840
The people of the village
started sneaking him extra food,

743
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:14,770
hoping to make him stronger.

744
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:17,533
The dragon grew so big he got stuck,

745
01:01:17,833 --> 01:01:22,880
and the treasure was trapped
behind him for all eternity.

746
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:27,480
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have found that lost treasure.

747
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:32,634
It is here, inside the greatest casino
in the world!

748
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:35,060
Welcome to the Red Dragon,

749
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:38,564
where everybody is a winner!

750
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:09,366
Look at this place, Lee.
It's the biggest front in the world.

751
01:02:09,466 --> 01:02:11,440
Yeah, right...

752
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:15,154
- Would you like a drink?
- Drink?

753
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,200
- Put your arms around me.
- What?

754
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:24,610
Hold me close.
There are cameras everywhere.

755
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:28,126
- What's going on?
- I think I may be in trouble, Lee.

756
01:02:28,226 --> 01:02:30,070
I really need your help.

757
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:33,148
Last time you needed my help,
I woke up in a truck.

758
01:02:33,248 --> 01:02:37,140
I'm undercover, Lee. I had no choice.
You have to trust me.

759
01:02:37,361 --> 01:02:40,420
Look over my right shoulder.
That's the soft count room.

760
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,660
We think the plates are in there.

761
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:46,000
- I need you to go and get them.
- Why don't you go get them?

762
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:51,080
Because if I'm wrong, then my entire
cover is blown, you understand?

763
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:55,897
- How do I know I can trust you?
- Dip me.

764
01:02:58,991 --> 01:03:00,845
I'm asking for real now.

765
01:03:01,245 --> 01:03:03,847
Will you help the Secret Service?

766
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:13,210
Hey, Lee! Lee!

767
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:16,112
What are you doing?

768
01:03:16,412 --> 01:03:17,846
Thank you, man. Take this.

769
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:21,260
- Dancing.
- Dancin'?

770
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,570
Man, I'm up here workin',
puttin' my life on the line,

771
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:27,937
and you're up here messin' around dancin'
with some bimbo? Does she have a friend?

772
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:31,750
That was Isabella. She says the plates
are in the soft count room.

773
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:35,899
Lee, I know you didn't just say Isabella.
Are you crazy? That girl is settin' you up again.

774
01:03:35,999 --> 01:03:40,050
- No. I'm gonna find out.
- No, wait, man.

775
01:03:41,584 --> 01:03:44,845
There's security all over. If you're gonna
do this, you're gonna need a distraction.

776
01:03:45,195 --> 01:03:48,527
So keep your eye on me,
and you'll know when to make your move.

777
01:03:48,627 --> 01:03:50,674
- Good.
- Cool.

778
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,950
- Come on, big eight!
- Come on, Tex! Come on, Tex!

779
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:06,223
Hey, hey, hey! Good roll, man!
This table's hot!

780
01:04:06,323 --> 01:04:08,610
I want some of this money.
Get me in this game. Come on.

781
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:11,840
Sir, are you aware that there's
a $50,000 buy-in this evening?

782
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:14,243
If that's the case,
give me $100,000 in chips.

783
01:04:14,343 --> 01:04:16,330
Let me have a diet Pepsi
and some hot wings.

784
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:18,850
- 100,000. Give him the chips.
- Come on! Let's play!

785
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:21,307
I'm gonna get some of this.

786
01:04:21,407 --> 01:04:23,665
- What's this?
- $500 chips, sir.

787
01:04:23,765 --> 01:04:25,740
You gave me $500 chips 'cause I'm black?

788
01:04:27,312 --> 01:04:29,546
No, sir. I did not.
I just assumed that...

789
01:04:29,646 --> 01:04:33,871
You assumed that a brother comin' in here
can only afford $500 a roll. Is that it?

790
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,280
No, I didn't think that at all, sir.

791
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:38,185
- You a racist?
- No, I'm not, sir.

792
01:04:38,285 --> 01:04:42,065
How come everybody else around the table got
$1,000 chips, and the black man got a nickel?

793
01:04:42,165 --> 01:04:45,202
- I don't know. It just happened.
- How did that happen? It just happened.

794
01:04:45,402 --> 01:04:46,662
This is crazy.

795
01:04:46,762 --> 01:04:50,628
You think my people suffered 362 years
of slavery so you could send us back

796
01:04:50,728 --> 01:04:52,827
- to the cotton fields with $500 chips?
- No.

797
01:04:52,927 --> 01:04:54,675
- Do I look like chicken George to you?
- You do not.

798
01:04:54,775 --> 01:04:56,814
- What the hell is that?
- I have no idea.

799
01:04:57,014 --> 01:04:58,194
I think you should calm down.

800
01:04:58,294 --> 01:05:00,424
I think you should go over there
and count somethin'.

801
01:05:00,524 --> 01:05:03,127
Give me my chips,
and I want $1,000 chips!

802
01:05:03,227 --> 01:05:06,092
Hurry up. I just want to be treated fairly.
Is that too much to ask?

803
01:05:06,192 --> 01:05:08,270
Is that too much to ask?

804
01:05:09,165 --> 01:05:11,471
I got a problem on table nine.

805
01:05:19,477 --> 01:05:22,730
How come ain't no black people performin'
in this hotel? We ain't good enough?

806
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:24,540
We got Lionel Ritchie
performin' here tonight.

807
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,180
Lionel Ritchie ain't been black
since the Commodores, man.

808
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,184
What about Peaches And Herb?
Gladys Knight and the Pips?

809
01:05:30,284 --> 01:05:33,770
Ike and Tina. They can get
back together. This is crazy.

810
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:36,633
Sir, why don't you calm down,
win some money, and have some fun?

811
01:05:36,733 --> 01:05:39,680
I ain't calmin' down no more!
I'm sick of you tryin' to calm me down.

812
01:05:40,130 --> 01:05:42,509
We got a problem. Go.

813
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:01,066
I have a dream...

814
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:04,250
that white people and black people...

815
01:06:04,915 --> 01:06:07,630
and even Chinese people
can gamble together...

816
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:11,314
- without gettin' different chips!
- Hallelujah!

817
01:06:15,415 --> 01:06:18,098
Hold it, hold it.
In the spirit of brotherhood,

818
01:06:18,198 --> 01:06:21,489
let's just play craps, man.
Come on. Let's go. Come on!

819
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:45,127
Oh, shit.

820
01:07:23,810 --> 01:07:25,143
Hey!

821
01:07:29,576 --> 01:07:31,254
Stop!

822
01:08:23,017 --> 01:08:26,300
- Winner.
- Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

823
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:29,634
I feel good.
Who put their hand on my butt?

824
01:08:29,734 --> 01:08:31,870
Do it again. Give me that.
How much I win?

825
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:36,557
- 200,000, sir.
- $200,000?

826
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:38,746
- Yeah!
- All right.

827
01:08:39,671 --> 01:08:43,455
This seven I'm about to roll is for the
27 years Mandela spent in that prison

828
01:08:43,555 --> 01:08:45,870
and couldn't get no justice
and took all that crap.

829
01:08:45,970 --> 01:08:50,494
That's why I ain't gonna crap out.
This one is for Mandela!

830
01:08:54,283 --> 01:08:58,539
Free at last, free at last

831
01:09:13,161 --> 01:09:14,768
Out.

832
01:09:18,130 --> 01:09:22,700
Imagine a business
where people hand you money,

833
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:27,624
and you hand them back
absolutely nothing.

834
01:09:28,890 --> 01:09:32,324
Now, that's the real American dream.

835
01:09:32,624 --> 01:09:35,008
Thanks to a few pieces of metal...

836
01:09:35,108 --> 01:09:38,754
and a most beautiful U.S. customs agent,

837
01:09:39,366 --> 01:09:41,493
I'm back in business.

838
01:09:47,515 --> 01:09:49,739
Look at you, Lee.

839
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:51,450
You look ridiculous.

840
01:09:54,214 --> 01:09:57,224
You know it didn't have to be like this.

841
01:09:58,408 --> 01:09:59,947
It's too bad.

842
01:10:00,047 --> 01:10:02,904
Like father, like son.

843
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,708
Look at this old fool.

844
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:16,347
What does he think he's doing?

845
01:10:16,847 --> 01:10:19,360
I tell you, it's almost impossible
to find a partner

846
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:22,530
that is trustworthy and loyal.

847
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:24,698
Don't you agree, Lee?

848
01:10:25,765 --> 01:10:29,770
Everything stays on the table. Don't nobody
touch that table. You understand?

849
01:10:29,870 --> 01:10:31,538
All right.

850
01:10:32,970 --> 01:10:35,403
Winner, four high, four high.

851
01:10:35,503 --> 01:10:38,157
Yes! Yes!

852
01:10:38,257 --> 01:10:41,179
Oh, my goodness! That's $500,000!

853
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:43,297
- Yes!
- Come on, sir.

854
01:10:49,013 --> 01:10:51,520
- Cash me out.
- You're gonna have to get off the table.

855
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:53,614
Thank you very much.

856
01:10:56,763 --> 01:11:00,404
The trouble with partners is...
they die.

857
01:11:10,316 --> 01:11:12,061
Have fun.

858
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:31,094
Don't move! U.S. Secret Service!
You're under arrest.

859
01:11:47,942 --> 01:11:50,343
These gentlemen will escort you
to the cashier.

860
01:11:50,443 --> 01:11:53,874
Good, 'cause I don't want to get jumped
by any of these rich white folks. Let's go.

861
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:20,204
I appreciate this, fellas.
You never can be too safe.

862
01:12:31,871 --> 01:12:33,591
What the...

863
01:12:34,115 --> 01:12:37,130
- I'm sorry, man. Did that hurt?
- Hey, you! Hold it!

864
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:40,151
You okay?

865
01:12:59,187 --> 01:13:01,514
Black man get on a roll,
y'all start trippin'.

866
01:13:01,614 --> 01:13:04,267
- Y'all get back!
- Calm down!

867
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:07,737
Get back! Get back!

868
01:13:08,037 --> 01:13:09,527
Get back!

869
01:13:13,592 --> 01:13:16,166
- Get down.
- Drop the stick.

870
01:13:16,566 --> 01:13:17,632
Lee!

871
01:13:22,890 --> 01:13:25,411
Where you been, Lee?
I been on a roll, man!

872
01:13:36,792 --> 01:13:39,124
What happened to you, man?

873
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:42,830
What's that light in your mouth?

874
01:13:42,930 --> 01:13:45,666
Oh, man, this can't be good.

875
01:13:59,741 --> 01:14:02,985
Move! Would you get out of my way?

876
01:14:15,153 --> 01:14:17,165
What's wrong with you?

877
01:14:17,330 --> 01:14:19,232
What happened to you, man?

878
01:14:42,693 --> 01:14:44,935
Why the hell you didn't tell me
you had a bomb in your mouth?

879
01:14:45,035 --> 01:14:46,355
- I did!
- No, you didn't!

880
01:14:46,455 --> 01:14:48,231
- I said "Mmm."
- What the hell is "Mmm"?

881
01:14:48,331 --> 01:14:50,177
"Mmm, boom!"

882
01:14:52,808 --> 01:14:56,385
Ricky Tan's still alive.
We have to get to the penthouse.

883
01:14:56,485 --> 01:14:59,614
Ricky Tan dead. What you talking about?

884
01:15:06,770 --> 01:15:09,430
Lee. Go after Ricky, man. I got this.

885
01:15:09,530 --> 01:15:13,252
- Carter...
- Just go, man. I got this.

886
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:19,670
I'm not gonna hold back on you
this time just because you're a woman.

887
01:15:19,770 --> 01:15:22,106
I'm gonna pretend you're a man.

888
01:15:23,370 --> 01:15:27,454
A very beautiful man with a perfect body,
who I'd like to take to the movies.

889
01:15:37,314 --> 01:15:40,560
You don't know nothin' about this,
do you? Egyptian style, girl.

890
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:43,375
You want some of this? Come on.

891
01:15:44,078 --> 01:15:45,894
Bring it on!

892
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,390
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

893
01:15:58,490 --> 01:16:00,491
You need help.

894
01:16:02,290 --> 01:16:04,395
I didn't know which side you were on.

895
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:07,668
Well, now you know.

896
01:16:07,768 --> 01:16:10,013
What's wrong with you, woman?

897
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:17,111
You smell good.

898
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:16,924
Thank you, Benjamin. Thank you.

899
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:25,110
We could have been a good couple.
We could have had somethin' special.

900
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:28,072
But you one crazy-ass bitch!

901
01:17:38,549 --> 01:17:42,260
American's love to gamble,
don't they, Mr. Reign?

902
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,300
I never gamble.

903
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,204
Oh, I'm, cutting our deal short.

904
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:51,950
And my plates?

905
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:56,474
The plates stay with me. I'm sure
you won't have a problem with that.

906
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:02,486
I enjoyed that little story you told
about the dragon and the treasure.

907
01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:05,195
My mother used to tell it
to me all the time.

908
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:09,402
Do you know the moral of that story?

909
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:12,328
Greed will imprison us all.

910
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:19,694
I hate that fortune-cookie shit.

911
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:35,633
Just like your father.

912
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:41,110
I really did try to help him, you know.
To share with him.

913
01:18:41,210 --> 01:18:43,403
To make your life better.

914
01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:46,362
But he was too weak.

915
01:18:46,462 --> 01:18:48,625
Too afraid of change.

916
01:18:48,725 --> 01:18:51,769
Give me the plates. It's over.

917
01:18:51,869 --> 01:18:53,580
I don't think it's over.

918
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:56,940
There are casinos all over this country.

919
01:18:57,690 --> 01:19:00,560
I can make you a very rich man, Lee.

920
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:03,050
Don't make the same mistake
your father did.

921
01:19:03,150 --> 01:19:07,400
If you reach for that gun,
I'll kill you.

922
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:11,264
Don't you remember? I'm already dead.

923
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:19,159
Hey, Ricky. How you doin'?

924
01:19:19,259 --> 01:19:23,540
I see you got everything under control.
I'm gonna go downstairs and... goddamn!

925
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:24,776
What happened to Reign?

926
01:19:24,876 --> 01:19:27,673
Would you like me to tell you
how your father died?

927
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,606
Hey, hey. Wait one second, Lee.

928
01:19:30,706 --> 01:19:33,487
It ain't worth it, man. He tryin'
to trick you. Don't go too far, now.

929
01:19:33,587 --> 01:19:36,293
He never begged for his life
or tried to make a deal.

930
01:19:36,393 --> 01:19:37,765
Put the gun down.

931
01:19:37,865 --> 01:19:41,880
All he asked me, just seconds
before I pulled the trigger,

932
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:45,352
was that I promise not to kill you.

933
01:19:45,452 --> 01:19:47,580
Oh, it was so pathetic.

934
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:51,281
Hell, no. He went too far. Shoot his ass
right now, Lee. Shoot his ass!

935
01:19:51,381 --> 01:19:52,644
What are you gonna do, Lee?

936
01:19:52,744 --> 01:19:55,041
All you got to do
is pull that trigger back and bam!

937
01:19:55,141 --> 01:19:58,460
Are you going to spend the rest
of your life hiding like your father?

938
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,850
Don't let him talk about your daddy
like that. Shoot him, Lee.

939
01:20:00,950 --> 01:20:03,590
- You can't do it, can you?
- Yes, hell, you can, Lee.

940
01:20:03,690 --> 01:20:06,370
- Ain't nobody up here but us.
- Just as I thought.

941
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:08,611
- He tryin' to punk you. Shoot him!
- Come on!

942
01:20:08,711 --> 01:20:11,260
If you ain't gonna shoot him,
Kung Fu his ass or somethin'.

943
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:13,195
Carter!

944
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:19,856
No!

945
01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:36,340
Damn! Good kick, Lee.

946
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,210
It was an accident.

947
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:41,634
That's okay. We'll just say
he tried to catch a cab.

948
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:47,340
What's that in your... oh, hell, no.

949
01:20:48,134 --> 01:20:51,182
Lady, you listen to me right now.
You put that bomb down and turn it off!

950
01:20:51,282 --> 01:20:54,990
- Carter, we have to jump!
- You crazy, man. I ain't jumpin'.

951
01:20:55,790 --> 01:20:58,016
- Use your jacket!
- Hey, turn that bomb off!

952
01:20:58,916 --> 01:21:00,902
Crazy-ass...

953
01:21:15,650 --> 01:21:17,876
That wasn't so bad.

954
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:58,462
I cannot believe I flew
10,000 miles for this shit.

955
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:11,192
Detective Lee, I hate to admit it,

956
01:22:11,292 --> 01:22:14,960
but the United States Secret Service
is indebted to you.

957
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:17,386
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

958
01:22:17,486 --> 01:22:19,540
I'll see you on board.

959
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:24,334
I want to thank you too.

960
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:35,000
It was nice working with you.

961
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:47,201
I saw that.

962
01:22:47,601 --> 01:22:51,468
You sly devil, you.
She kissed you, didn't she?

963
01:22:52,433 --> 01:22:55,330
You played it cool, too, walkin' away
and not lookin' back. I like that.

964
01:22:55,430 --> 01:22:57,274
Yeah. I'm a player.

965
01:22:58,950 --> 01:23:02,834
- Where is she headed?
- She's going to New York.

966
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:07,412
- Is that your gate down there?
- Yep.

967
01:23:08,185 --> 01:23:10,150
Well, I'm this way.

968
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:12,990
- Guess that mean good-bye.
- I guess so.

969
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:16,191
Thank you, Carter.

970
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:18,481
Take good care of yourself, Lee.

971
01:23:22,850 --> 01:23:25,460
- Oh, Carter.
- Yeah, Lee?

972
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:27,437
What's up?

973
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:31,442
There is something I want you to have.

974
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,910
Oh, no, man. This is your daddy's badge.
I can't take that, man. No way.

975
01:23:36,010 --> 01:23:38,573
It's okay. No. Finally, I can let it go.

976
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:45,397
Thank you, man. Hey, you know what?
I got somethin' for you too.

977
01:23:47,570 --> 01:23:49,925
- What is this?
- That's $10,000, man.

978
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:52,740
I got it at the tables this mornin'
at Caesar's. I'm still hot.

979
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:56,310
- I can't take this.
- Don't worry about it. I got a lot more.

980
01:23:56,410 --> 01:23:58,970
- Go ahead. Enjoy yourself.
- No, Carter. I can't have this.

981
01:23:59,070 --> 01:24:02,044
Would you stop actin' like a cop
for one second, man, and live it up?

982
01:24:02,144 --> 01:24:04,690
There gotta be something
you want. Come on.

983
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:06,259
Think about it.

984
01:24:06,359 --> 01:24:10,511
<i>This is the final boarding call
for flight 44 to La Guardia...</i>

985
01:24:12,027 --> 01:24:15,770
I always wanted to go to Madison
Square Garden, see the Knicks play.

986
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:18,060
- New York City?
- First class.

987
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:20,550
- The Plaza Hotel?
- Maybe a little mu shu?

988
01:24:20,650 --> 01:24:23,210
- Amen to that, brother.
- So, what do you say?

989
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:27,003
You know what, man?
I can use another vacation.

990
01:24:40,671 --> 01:24:43,077
- Action!
- Let's go!

991
01:25:08,899 --> 01:25:11,168
- You all right?
- Is he okay?

992
01:25:11,268 --> 01:25:14,501
- Jackie, you okay?
- Jackie always okay.

993
01:25:15,038 --> 01:25:18,309
- Is this the kosher meal?
- Yes, sir. That's our kosher meal.

994
01:25:18,409 --> 01:25:20,811
- What's the name of it?
- Gefilte.

995
01:25:20,911 --> 01:25:23,447
- Gefilte fish.
- "Filk" fish.

996
01:25:23,547 --> 01:25:26,450
Lox and bagels. It's my favorite.

997
01:25:26,850 --> 01:25:29,554
- What's the name of this stuff?
- Gefilte fish.

998
01:25:30,254 --> 01:25:32,151
"Gefilke" fish...
What's the name of this fish?

999
01:25:32,251 --> 01:25:35,614
- Gefilte fish.
- Gefilke... gefilte...

1000
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:38,262
You know what this is? What is it?

1001
01:25:38,362 --> 01:25:40,598
- Gefilte fish.
- It's "filte" fish.

1002
01:25:40,798 --> 01:25:42,633
"Filte" fish. You want some
of my "filte" fish?

1003
01:25:42,733 --> 01:25:46,600
You want any of this...
What's the name of the fish?

1004
01:25:47,039 --> 01:25:50,408
- Gefilte fish.
- Gefilte fish! All right. Okay.

1005
01:25:50,508 --> 01:25:52,312
- Gefilte fish.
- I love this stuff.

1006
01:25:52,412 --> 01:25:55,279
I really don't. You have black people
all over the world eatin' this.

1007
01:25:55,379 --> 01:25:59,410
Who eats lox and bagels?
I'll have some "gilte" fish.

1008
01:26:13,497 --> 01:26:15,766
Lady! Jackie, kick it.

1009
01:26:15,866 --> 01:26:18,235
Okay. Chris Tucker!

1010
01:26:18,929 --> 01:26:22,106
- Jackie, kick it.
- Jackie again?

1011
01:26:22,306 --> 01:26:24,708
We'd love to see that.
Wouldn't we love to see that, Jackie?

1012
01:26:25,578 --> 01:26:29,580
Jackie, we'd like to see that.
Jackie, wouldn't we love to see that?

1013
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:33,117
- His name is Lee, goddamn it.
- Lee, we would love to see that.

1014
01:26:33,217 --> 01:26:34,885
We would love to see that,
wouldn't we, Lee?

1015
01:26:34,985 --> 01:26:38,872
- There's gotta be something you want.
- I always want to go to...

1016
01:26:38,972 --> 01:26:41,469
I always want to go to Scra...

1017
01:26:41,975 --> 01:26:44,904
I always dreamed to "Square Marden."

1018
01:26:45,312 --> 01:26:47,420
I always wanted to...

1019
01:26:49,983 --> 01:26:52,353
Now I'm gone. Now I'm nervous.

1020
01:26:52,453 --> 01:26:56,023
Every "garden," I'm nervous.
Madison Square Garden.

1021
01:26:56,123 --> 01:26:58,998
I always wanted to go to this Madison...

1022
01:27:00,661 --> 01:27:01,885
There are a lot of men chasing us.

1023
01:27:01,985 --> 01:27:04,110
As well there should be.
'Cause you're a very good-looking man.

1024
01:27:04,210 --> 01:27:06,153
If I didn't have a girlfriend
I'd take a run at you,

1025
01:27:06,253 --> 01:27:10,004
I'd put you in a bubble bath and put water
wings on you and spank your little bottom.

1026
01:27:10,104 --> 01:27:14,355
But listen. Here's what we do, guys.
Easy, easy. Look, you're giggling at me.

1027
01:27:14,455 --> 01:27:18,812
I'll take you home and just punish you.
I need both of you.

1028
01:27:18,912 --> 01:27:22,450
You sly devil, you.
She kissed you, didn't she?

1029
01:27:22,850 --> 01:27:24,918
Yeah. I like that.

1030
01:27:26,446 --> 01:27:28,426
- Hold on.
- Who's calling?

1031
01:27:28,526 --> 01:27:30,858
- Hello?
- Say hello to your dad.

1032
01:27:30,958 --> 01:27:34,428
Hello? I'm filming, man.

1033
01:27:34,821 --> 01:27:36,730
Call me back at 7:00. I'm filming.

1034
01:27:36,830 --> 01:27:39,600
I'm looking Jackie Chan
dead in his eye. Call me back.

1035
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:42,503
- Call me back.
- Are you a professional? We are filming.

1036
01:27:42,603 --> 01:27:46,073
- You turn on your phone?
- No, you can't speak to Jackie Chan.

1037
01:27:46,173 --> 01:27:47,875
No! They want to speak to you, Jackie.

1038
01:27:47,975 --> 01:27:50,177
- Hello?
- I'm sorry about this.

1039
01:27:50,277 --> 01:27:52,846
We are filming right now!

1040
01:27:52,946 --> 01:27:56,256
You're sorry? You waste all our film!

1041
01:27:56,984 --> 01:27:59,445
Call me back later. 7:00.

1042
01:28:04,541 --> 01:28:06,028
Damn!

1043
01:28:06,128 --> 01:28:08,609
He ain't gonna be in Rush Hour 3.
