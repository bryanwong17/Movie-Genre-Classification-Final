1
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,553
Good morning, James.

2
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,833
How are you feeling?

3
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,113
Wait. What?

4
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,273
It's perfectly normal to feel confused.

5
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,913
You just spent 120 years
in suspended animation.

6
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,510
What?

7
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,314
It's okay, James.

8
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,872
- It's Jim.
- Jim.

9
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,679
Just breathe. Everything is okay.

10
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,075
Where am I?

11
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,231
You're a passenger on the Starship Avalon,

12
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,950
the Homestead Company's
premier interstellar starliner.

13
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,677
We've nearly completed the voyage
from Earth to your new home.

14
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,117
The colony world of Homestead II.

15
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,960
A new world. A fresh start.

16
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,554
Room to grow.

17
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,313
Yeah.

18
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,437
The Avalon is on final approach.

19
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,591
For the next four months,
you'll enjoy space travel

20
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,558
at its most luxurious.

21
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,550
Food. Fun. Friends.

22
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,075
- My friends.
- That's right, Jim.

23
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,512
The ID band on your wrist is your key
to the wonders of the Avalon.

24
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,879
You're in perfect health, Jim.

25
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,475
Let's get you to your cabin,
where you can get some rest.

26
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,359
You may be experiencing
post-hibernation sickness.

27
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,950
Your door will illuminate for you.

28
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,520
Welcome to your cabin,

29
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,910
your home until we make landfall.

30
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,110
Over the next four months,

31
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,079
you'll prepare for your new life
on Homestead II,

32
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,638
meet your fellow passengers,
take skill-building classes,

33
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,598
and learn about colonial living.

34
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,510
You've been assigned to learning group 38

35
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,718
for passengers with engineering
and technical trade skills.

36
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,515
Please scan your ID
to confirm luggage delivery.

37
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,395
Jim.

38
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,154
Please scan your ID
to confirm luggage delivery.

39
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,317
To help you recover from hibernation,
be sure to drink plenty of fluids.

40
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,555
Enjoy the rest of your voyage on the Avalon,

41
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,791
a Homestead Company Starship.

42
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,874
Good morning, one and all.

43
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,595
It's a beautiful morning
here on the Starship Avalon.

44
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,400
Whatever you do, don't get homesick,
get Homestead.

45
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,711
Let's start things off
with one of my favorites back on Earth.

46
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,080
No.

47
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,519
That's stupid.

48
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,558
Just own it. Own it, Jim.
You got a cool jacket.

49
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,513
Hello, passengers.

50
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,152
Will you all please take a seat.

51
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,439
Welcome, learning group 38.

52
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,194
Your introduction to colonial life.

53
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,430
Earth is a prosperous planet,
the cradle of civilization.

54
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,671
But for many, it's also overpopulated,
overpriced, overrated.

55
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,431
I'm sorry, I think I may be in the wrong...

56
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,318
Hold all questions till the end, please.

57
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,430
Sorry.

58
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,399
The colonies offer an alternative,
a better way of life.

59
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,630
Where are all the other...

60
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,760
And there's no colony
more beautiful than Homestead II,

61
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,752
the jewel of the occupied world.

62
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,194
I'm sorry.

63
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,475
Where is everybody?

64
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,997
We are all on the Starship Avalon.

65
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,434
But I'm the only one here.

66
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,639
There are 5,000 passengers
and 258 crew members.

67
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,395
So why am I alone?

68
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,752
We're all in this together.

69
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,910
Hello?

70
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,200
Anybody here?

71
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,040
Hello?

72
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,039
Please buckle up and secure any loose items.

73
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,830
This elevator will experience
a momentary lapse in gravity.

74
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,758
Grand concourse.

75
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,830
Hello.

76
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,996
Welcome to the grand concourse
aboard the Avalon.

77
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,270
Can I help you?

78
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,072
I need to talk to a person.

79
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,799
A real live person, please?

80
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,076
What sort of person?
Personal trainer? Travel planner?

81
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,759
- Therapist?
- I don't know.

82
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,234
Somebody in charge.

83
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,118
The ship's steward handles passenger affairs.

84
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,317
It's on level three of the grand concourse.

85
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,073
- Thank you.
- Happy to help.

86
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,790
Not good.

87
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,759
- Hello.
- Who's flying the ship?

88
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,752
The flight crew, the captain, the pilot,
the chief navigator...

89
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,911
Captain. I want to speak to the captain.

90
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,832
The captain rarely handles
passenger queries...

91
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,673
It's an emergency! Please.

92
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,437
The captain is usually found on the bridge,
in the command ring.

93
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,833
Bridge access requires special authorization.

94
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,679
Bridge access requires special authorization.

95
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,951
You got to be kidding me.

96
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,591
Welcome to the observatory.

97
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,029
What can I show you?

98
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,237
We're supposed to land soon.

99
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,879
I'm the only one awake.

100
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,549
I don't understand. What can I show you?

101
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,640
Show me Homestead II.

102
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,758
Homestead II is the fourth planet
in the Bhakti System.

103
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,316
Right. And where are we?

104
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,393
We're in transit from Earth to Homestead II.

105
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,314
We will arrive in approximately 90 years.

106
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,356
What?

107
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,831
We arrive at Homestead II
in 90 years, three weeks and one day.

108
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,070
No. Wait.

109
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,753
How long ago did we leave Earth?

110
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,309
Approximately 30 years ago.

111
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,630
I woke up too soon.

112
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,996
Hello.

113
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,679
How do I send a message to Earth?

114
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,150
Interstellar messages
are sent by laser array.

115
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,674
This is an expensive service.

116
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,433
- Bite me.
- Happy to help.

117
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,590
Planet and connection?

118
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,792
Earth. The Homestead Company.

119
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,279
There are 30,826 contacts
listed under Homestead Company.

120
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,913
I'm emigrating to Homestead II
and I have an emergency.

121
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,195
I have a customer help line.

122
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,270
Sounds about right.

123
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,670
Begin message.

124
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,720
Hi. I'm Jim Preston.

125
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,034
I'm a passenger on the Avalon.

126
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,274
I...

127
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,114
I think something went wrong
with my hibernation pod.

128
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,554
I woke up too soon.

129
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,316
And I mean, way too soon.

130
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,040
Nobody else is awake, and...

131
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,353
I don't know how to get back to sleep.

132
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,558
And the thing is, there's 90 years to go.

133
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,400
At this rate, I'm...

134
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,355
I'm sorry, I'm trying to fix this.

135
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,473
Maybe I missed something. I could use a hand.

136
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,514
That's all.

137
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,356
Thank you.

138
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,280
Message sent.

139
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,476
Outstanding.

140
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,836
Message will arrive in 19 years.

141
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,036
Wait, what?

142
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,272
Earliest reply in 55 years.

143
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,837
Fifty-five years?

144
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,191
We apologize for the delay.

145
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,795
That will be $6,012.

146
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,633
- Afternoon.
- Man!

147
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,792
Is it good to see another face!

148
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,720
Thought I was the only one awake.

149
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,912
Who wants to sleep
on a beautiful day like this?

150
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,914
No, I mean we're in trouble.
We're not supposed to be here.

151
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,038
Well, I won't tell if you don't.

152
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,760
Our little secret.

153
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,675
What can I get for you?

154
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,870
What?

155
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,434
You look like a whiskey man.

156
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,509
Okay.

157
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,834
You're a robot.

158
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,756
Android. Technically.

159
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,350
Arthur's the name.

160
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,830
- Jim.
- Pleased to meet you, Jim.

161
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,593
How much do you know about this ship?

162
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,560
I don't know.

163
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,710
I know some things.

164
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,230
What do I do
if my hibernation pod malfunctions?

165
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,789
Hibernation pods are fail-safe.

166
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,200
They never malfunction.

167
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,475
Well, I woke up early.

168
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,990
Can't happen.

169
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,512
How long until we get to Homestead II?

170
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,432
About 90 years or so.

171
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,477
And when are all the passengers
supposed to wake up?

172
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,392
Not till the last four months.

173
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,551
How is it that I'm sitting here with you

174
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,839
with 90 years to go?

175
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,794
It's not possible for you to be here.

176
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,194
Well, I am.

177
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,560
Good morning.
It's a beautiful day here on the Avalon.

178
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,918
So wake up, sunshine.
It's time to relax and enjoy your stay.

179
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,878
Please make a selection.

180
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,839
Sorry. The Mocha Cappuccino Extreme
is reserved for gold-class passengers.

181
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,480
Sorry. The Mocha Cappuccino Extreme
is reserved for...

182
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,960
I want the Mocha Cappuccino Extreme.

183
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,076
Bill my room, please.

184
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,719
Food can be purchased in the ship's...

185
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,280
Sorry. The French Roast...

186
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,714
Sorry. The Pumpkin Spice...

187
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,390
Sorry. Vanilla Chai...

188
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,749
Sorry. Sorry.

189
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,910
Sorry.

190
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,950
Large coffee.

191
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,997
- Cream...
- Please enjoy your coffee.

192
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,510
Really?

193
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,516
Crew pod room access
requires special authorization.

194
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,595
Grand...

195
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,670
Going...

196
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,271
Please make... Level...

197
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,193
Grand concourse.

198
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,396
I'm screwed, Arthur.

199
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,072
Completely and ridiculously screwed.

200
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,480
Come on, now.

201
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,597
Every cloud has a silver lining.

202
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,639
Guess I am gonna die of old age on this ship.

203
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,194
We all die.

204
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,673
Even androids end up on the scrap heap.

205
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,310
I'm your only customer.
Why are you always polishing a glass?

206
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,920
Trick of the trade.

207
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,640
Makes people nervous
when a bartender just stands there.

208
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,279
So lay some bartender wisdom on me.

209
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,153
I'm lost in space here.

210
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,955
You're not where you want to be.

211
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,555
You feel like you're supposed
to be somewhere else.

212
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,070
You said it.

213
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,919
Well, say you could snap your fingers

214
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,430
and be wherever you wanted to be.

215
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,273
I bet you'd still feel this way.

216
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,074
Not in the right place.

217
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,949
Point is, you can't get so hung up
on where you'd rather be

218
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,271
that you forget how to make
the most of where you are.

219
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,394
What are you telling me?

220
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,518
Take a break from worrying
about what you can't control.

221
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,356
Live a little.

222
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,158
Live a little.

223
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,800
Welcome to the Vienna Suite.

224
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,560
Yeah.

225
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,834
What?

226
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,391
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah!

227
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,994
Make that a double jumbo shrimp.

228
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,196
Triple.

229
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,750
Dance-off.

230
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,514
All right.

231
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,755
I did exactly what you just did.

232
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,792
Large coffee.

233
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,919
You have had many, señor.

234
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,280
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

235
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,478
Get out of here!

236
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,349
Come back. Hey.

237
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,116
Come here.

238
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,399
Welcome, Jim.

239
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,160
Please turn your attention

240
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,472
to the screens displaying safety tips.

241
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,839
These spacesuits are designed
to withstand the harsh environment of space.

242
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,116
The carbon fiber and polyamide construction

243
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,557
means your suit is both flexible and durable.

244
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,720
Remember, your spacesuit is your lifeline.

245
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,709
Slide the handle on the right
to release the air pressure.

246
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,356
Your magnetic boots are now engaged.

247
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,672
They can be deactivated
using the control panel on your arm.

248
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,315
Press the red button
to open the airlock door.

249
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,073
Have a wonderful time.

250
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,636
Tether attached.

251
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,674
Welcome back, Jim.

252
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,471
We hope you decide to join us again soon

253
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,916
for another thrilling experience.

254
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,877
Have a wonderful time.

255
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,039
Aurora.

256
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,831
Searching passenger profiles.

257
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,873
I'm Aurora Lane.

258
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,919
Passenger 1456. I'm a writer.

259
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,720
I think we tell each other stories

260
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,474
to know we're not alone, to make contact.

261
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,077
Your father was Oliver Lane,
a Pulitzer Prize-winning author.

262
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,435
No pressure, right?

263
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,911
My dad used to say,
"If you live an ordinary life,

264
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,276
"all you'll have are ordinary stories.

265
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,511
"You have to live a life of adventure."

266
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,553
So...

267
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,710
Here I am.

268
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,319
Good morning.

269
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,799
We're starting over in every way.

270
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,040
I'll have to figure out
where to live, how to live,

271
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,634
who my friends will be.

272
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,995
It's like the first day of school.

273
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,231
If the school bus
took 120 years to get there.

274
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,272
We're creating a culture...

275
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,476
You are funny.

276
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,280
Do you ever read something
and feel like it's written just for you?

277
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,872
I don't do a lot of reading.

278
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,713
She's good.

279
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,960
Who's that?

280
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,440
Aurora.

281
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,076
The sleeping girl.

282
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,197
You know, I'm not saying
the universe is evil,

283
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,078
but it sure has a nasty sense of humor.

284
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,150
How is that?

285
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,755
You get to fly to another planet,

286
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,309
but you'll die along the way.

287
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,869
And you find the perfect woman

288
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,959
right in front of you...

289
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,913
Yet she's completely out of reach.

290
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,233
Yeah, I'll miss New York City.

291
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,189
Give me a cup of coffee and a view of the
Chrysler Building, and I can write all day.

292
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,677
They do have coffee on Homestead II, right?

293
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,836
They better have coffee.

294
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,276
If they don't, I have to turn around
and come back to Earth.

295
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,517
Is there anything you regret leaving behind?

296
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:48,070
Yeah, I'll miss the trees in Central Park
turning in the fall.

297
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,114
I'll also miss crowds...

298
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,593
Say you were trapped on a desert island,

299
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,920
and you had the power
to wish somebody there with you.

300
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,798
You wouldn't be alone anymore.

301
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,911
But you'd be stranding the person
on the island.

302
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,430
Would you make that wish?

303
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,876
I don't know. I've never been on an island.

304
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,599
Okay, well, yeah.

305
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,596
Forget the island.

306
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,114
Let's say you figured out how to do something

307
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,439
that would make your life
a million times better,

308
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,115
but you knew it was wrong
and there's no taking it back.

309
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,270
How do you do the math?

310
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,751
Jim, these are not robot questions.

311
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,714
I know how to wake Aurora up.

312
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,513
Well, that seems like a fine idea.

313
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,670
You could use some company.

314
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,475
I'd be stranding her on this ship
for the rest of her life.

315
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,755
Well, you can't do that.

316
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,515
What am I gonna do?

317
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,074
I'm here for you.

318
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,958
Arthur, you're a machine.

319
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,313
See? You can't feel that.
You don't have feelings.

320
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,350
See?

321
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,113
That doesn't hurt.

322
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,634
And you don't even mind.

323
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,314
'Cause you're not a person.

324
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,440
Don't even think about it.

325
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,920
No more Aurora talk.

326
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,434
I'm over it.

327
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,950
I'm moving on.

328
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,118
Don't even think about it!

329
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,078
What am I gonna do?
I'm just gonna sit and think about it?

330
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,640
I can't think about it, so I'm not going to.

331
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,552
That's the deal. I've made my decision.

332
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,630
I know what I'm doing.

333
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,436
I just cut it off.

334
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,030
I'm not... No more.

335
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,634
You won't hear me bring up her name again.

336
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,035
I'll never even mention her name again.

337
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,470
Done.

338
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,193
You can't do it.

339
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,794
Shaving off my beard.

340
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,552
Please don't do it.

341
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,434
Good morning, Aurora.

342
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,671
How are you feeling?

343
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,559
It's perfectly normal to feel confused.

344
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,752
You just spent 120 years
in suspended animation.

345
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,197
Grand concourse.

346
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,714
Hello?

347
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,469
Anybody?

348
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,350
Hello.

349
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,230
Hi.

350
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,398
Are you passenger or crew?

351
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,273
Passenger.

352
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,510
Jim Preston.

353
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,239
Aurora Lane.

354
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,438
Do you know what's going on?

355
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,432
Nobody else from my row woke up.

356
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,830
Same for me.

357
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,634
The crew's supposed to wake up
a month before we do,

358
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,473
but I haven't seen anybody.

359
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,880
The crew is still asleep.

360
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,679
Are you saying nobody's awake?

361
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,436
Just me.

362
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,950
Just you?

363
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,395
It's just us.

364
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,756
But somebody's got to land the ship
in a few weeks.

365
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,877
We will arrive in approximately 89 years.

366
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,112
Eighty-nine years?

367
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,274
The other passengers aren't late waking up.

368
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,433
We were early.

369
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,316
We need help.

370
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,629
Where's the crew?

371
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,954
The crew's in a secure hibernation room.

372
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,317
Everything important, the controls,
the reactors, the engines...

373
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,993
It's all behind firewalls.

374
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,753
There's no way through.

375
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,476
How long have you been awake?

376
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,879
A year and three weeks.

377
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,360
No. No, no, no.

378
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,634
No, this can't be happening.

379
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,198
We have to go back to sleep.

380
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,200
Aurora, we can't.

381
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,357
We just have to get back to our pods
and start them up again.

382
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,280
I can't find my pod. I can't find my pod.

383
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,591
I can't find my pod. I don't know which...

384
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,160
It doesn't matter.

385
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,799
- Aurora...
- I can't find it!

386
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,633
- Stop. Aurora...
- I can't find which one is mine!

387
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,359
- Stop.
- I don't know which one is mine!

388
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,510
- I'll help you.
- I can't...

389
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,115
Stop! It doesn't matter.

390
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,071
Putting somebody into hibernation
requires special equipment.

391
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,632
Remember the facility
where they put us under,

392
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,076
all the procedures we went through?

393
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,436
These pods are designed
to keep us in hibernation,

394
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,034
to wake us up at the right time,

395
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,753
but they can't put us back to sleep.

396
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,714
You don't think there's a way
back into hibernation?

397
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,594
No.

398
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,239
But there has to be.

399
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,514
There has to be.

400
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,154
9:00. Nighttime.

401
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,073
I know I should be
working the problem, but...

402
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,513
I can't even keep my eyes open.

403
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,472
You just came out of hibernation.

404
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,995
It's going to be a couple of days
before you're 100%.

405
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,514
You should get some rest.

406
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,313
Think I'm gonna have to.

407
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,000
I'll walk you to your cabin.

408
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,595
No, it's okay. I'll be all right.

409
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,470
Okay.

410
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,396
Good night, Aurora.

411
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,235
More than a year?

412
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,118
I can't imagine.

413
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,354
It must have been so hard for you.

414
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,914
It was.

415
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,434
Good night, Jim.

416
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,318
Please buckle up and secure any loose items.

417
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,951
- Whiskey, neat.
- Sure thing.

418
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,116
How's your day been?

419
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,110
Aurora's awake.

420
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,993
Congratulations.

421
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,754
You don't look happy.

422
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,599
Arthur, can you keep a secret?

423
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,200
Jim...

424
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,840
I'm not just a bartender, I'm a gentleman.

425
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,790
Don't tell Aurora that I woke her up.

426
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,589
She thinks it was an accident.
Let me tell her.

427
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,240
Of course.

428
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,116
How can there be no way
to put someone back into hibernation?

429
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,600
What if a pod breaks down?

430
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,799
No hibernation pod has malfunctioned
in thousands of interstellar flights.

431
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,040
Well, I'm awake.

432
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,396
Hibernation pods are fail-safe.

433
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,269
Good morning.

434
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,273
- Have you eaten?
- No. I'm starving.

435
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,670
And this is the dumbest machine.

436
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,314
Happy to help.

437
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,037
Gold-class breakfast.

438
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,193
Well, you're a man of simple tastes.

439
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,951
I'm not a gold-class passenger.

440
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,397
French breakfast puff's above my pay grade.

441
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,960
What? This whole time?

442
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,793
- Yeah.
- What can I get you?

443
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,837
- No. No, I'm fine.
- Stop it.

444
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,718
Really. Okay.

445
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,760
Here you go.

446
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,670
Yeah.

447
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,472
So, I was thinking,
maybe there's another way to go to sleep.

448
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,755
What about the infirmary?

449
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,230
I checked it out.
It's just scanners and an Autodoc.

450
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,755
There could be another hibernation machine
in the cargo hold.

451
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,956
I had that thought, too.

452
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,310
And then I read the manifest.

453
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,437
It's mostly farming stuff,
machines and trade goods.

454
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,156
Replacement parts
for computers and engineering.

455
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,596
We're not gonna find
a hibernation facility in a box.

456
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,399
- We could build our own.
- We can't.

457
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,550
Jim, you're not even trying.

458
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,950
I have tried everything.

459
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,033
For over a year, I...

460
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,396
I tried everything.

461
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,916
Well...

462
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,074
Well, I'm not ready to give up.

463
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,233
Infirmary.

464
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,794
What about research articles?
Any kind of technical documents.

465
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,475
Hibernation technology is proprietary.

466
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,270
The following articles deal with the subject
on a theoretical level.

467
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,876
New file. My voyage.

468
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,716
I boarded the Avalon with an idea,
a destination.

469
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,877
Both now out of reach.

470
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,879
I've been awake for seven days.

471
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,957
Awake far too soon.

472
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,556
And I may well spend
the rest of my life here,

473
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:15,149
in a steel world 1,000 meters long.

474
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,918
There's another passenger awake,
a mechanic named Jim Preston.

475
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,720
He seems to have accepted our fate.

476
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,392
But I'm scared.

477
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,999
I'm fighting to stay calm.

478
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,230
All the other passengers will sleep

479
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,312
for another 90 years

480
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,155
while I live out my life on this ship,

481
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,639
traveling forever...

482
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,472
Never arriving...

483
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,796
My only companion a total stranger.

484
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,110
Why did you do it?

485
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,830
Do what?

486
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,949
Emigrate. Leave Earth.

487
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,440
I'm interviewing you.

488
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,590
You're what?

489
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,277
You were the first hibernation failure
in the history of space travel.

490
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,430
That makes you a story.

491
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,840
Who you gonna tell?

492
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,070
Posterity.

493
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,959
So, why did you give up your life on Earth?

494
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:28,355
120-year space hibernation means you'll
never see your family or friends again.

495
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,760
You'll wake up in a new century
on a new planet.

496
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,559
It's the ultimate geographical suicide.

497
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,396
Well, I could ask you the same thing.

498
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,312
But it's my interview.

499
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,592
Were you running away from something?

500
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,319
No.

501
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,710
- Everything was okay.
- So?

502
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,470
Well, I guess I just wanted a new
world, I don't know, a fresh start.

503
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,552
That's Homestead Company advertising.

504
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,040
- Is it?
- Jim.

505
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,998
I know. I guess. You're right.

506
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,319
Back on Earth, when something breaks,
you don't fix it, you replace it.

507
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,920
The colonies, they have problems to solve.

508
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,833
They're my kind of problems.

509
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,631
And a mechanic is somebody.

510
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,916
This is a new world still being built.

511
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,311
I could build a house and live in it.

512
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,840
Open country. Room to grow.

513
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,389
Now you're back to slogans.

514
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,234
Can't slogans be true?

515
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,631
Do you know how much Homestead
Company made off its first planet?

516
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,791
Eight quadrillion dollars.

517
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,600
That's eight million billions.

518
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,076
Colony planets
are the biggest business going.

519
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,193
Did you pay full price for your ticket?

520
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,636
No. I'm in a desirable trade.

521
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,272
So they fill your head with dreams,
discount your ticket,

522
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,238
and you fly off to populate their planet

523
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,437
and give Homestead
20% of everything that you make

524
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,510
for the rest of your life.

525
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,718
Not to mention the debt you run up
on this fancy starship.

526
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,871
So all you see here is 5,000 suckers?

527
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,391
I see zeros
on the Homestead Company's bottom line.

528
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,759
I see 5,000 men and women
changing their lives.

529
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,354
For 5,000 different reasons.
You don't know these people.

530
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,120
I'm a journalist. I know people.

531
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,790
Really?

532
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,550
This one.

533
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,509
Is he a banker, a teacher or a gardener?

534
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,913
- Banker.
- He's a gardener.

535
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,115
And her. Is she a...

536
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,960
Madison, Donna or a Lola?

537
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,352
Donna's too serious for that hair.

538
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,430
Lola.

539
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,317
- Madison.
- Shit!

540
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,514
All right, chef, accountant or midwife?

541
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,796
She has to be a midwife.

542
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,439
There's no way you just made that one up.

543
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,556
Yeah. She's a midwife.

544
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,431
I didn't know they still had midwives.

545
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,075
I like her. We'd be friends.

546
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,393
You think you can see that?

547
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,880
Don't you?

548
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,230
I do.

549
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,875
- A round-trip ticket?
- That's right.

550
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,350
I was gonna fly to Homestead II,
live for a year,

551
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,760
and then right back to Earth.

552
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:16,477
I don't get it. I left Earth for a new life,
but you end up back where you started?

553
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,199
I end up in the future.

554
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,476
Two hundred and fifty years in the future,

555
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,314
on Earth, which is still
the center of civilization,

556
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,629
like it or not.

557
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,951
And I'll be the only writer to ever travel
to a colony world and come back.

558
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,958
I'll have a story no one else can tell.

559
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,560
What story?

560
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,950
Humanity's flight to the stars.

561
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,997
The greatest migration in human history.

562
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,719
It's the biggest story there is.

563
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,997
But you won't know
any of the people who are reading it.

564
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,560
But they'd be reading it.

565
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,314
Or they would have been.

566
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,315
I'll never write it now.

567
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,479
I don't know if I'll ever write again.

568
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,959
Jim, I can't think of anything else to try

569
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,439
to save us.

570
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,830
And I don't even want to
think about it anymore.

571
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,674
What is there to do around here?

572
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,916
- Are you serious?
- Dead serious.

573
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,558
- Partner mode.
- Let's get it on!

574
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,514
Come on, get in power mode.

575
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,719
You just stand here.

576
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,200
And then we repeat what they do.

577
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,517
Is there anything else we can do?

578
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,795
- Just do the...
- Okay.

579
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,950
- You don't have to.
- Okay. I can...

580
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,112
- Beat down!
- Hey!

581
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,434
Here we go. Let's see it.

582
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,832
- Why you smiling?
- Aurora! Aurora!

583
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,559
'Cause I'm up two points.

584
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,309
Who's the lovely lady?

585
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,635
This is Aurora.

586
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,111
Aurora. A pleasure.

587
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,353
- I can't!
- You did great!

588
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,518
Okay, one more time.
One more time, let's see it.

589
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,710
Yes!

590
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,673
I swear, I didn't wear pants for a month.

591
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:25,595
Seven weeks and two days, to be exact.

592
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,909
The man has no shame.

593
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,430
Well, you're a little lacking
in that area yourself, Arthur.

594
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,474
I laughed at the man with no pants

595
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,677
until I realized I have no legs.

596
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,590
For a minute,
I almost forgot my life is in ruins.

597
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,235
I'm sorry.

598
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,394
What for?

599
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,280
I'm gonna go to bed.

600
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,110
Good night.

601
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,793
- All right.
- Good night, Aurora.

602
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,914
She is wonderful.

603
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,114
Excellent choice.

604
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,590
Hello.

605
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,390
Hi.

606
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,030
Here you go.

607
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,238
Is he asking me on a date?

608
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,199
Do you need a pen?

609
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,593
She didn't seem that impressed.

610
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,877
"Love to." She wrote, "Love to."

611
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,519
You have a visitor.

612
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,592
You clean up pretty good yourself.

613
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,356
You went shopping.

614
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,960
I went shoplifting.

615
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,236
Evening.

616
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,795
What can I get for you?

617
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,872
I'll have a Manhattan, please.

618
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,158
- Whiskey, rocks.
- Coming up.

619
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,040
You two look fine this evening.

620
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,915
Thank you, Arthur. We're on a date.

621
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,800
Very nice.

622
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,353
Took you long enough to ask.

623
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,160
I was giving you space.

624
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,149
Space.

625
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,550
The one thing I do not need more of.

626
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,354
That was so good.

627
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,834
It wasn't easy getting a reservation.

628
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,750
They're probably gonna want us
to give up our table.

629
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,115
I'm getting a lot of dirty looks.

630
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,714
Very popular tonight.

631
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,234
So how's your book coming?

632
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,437
I don't really know what it is yet.

633
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,592
My dad, he used to always
write about his life,

634
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,279
but he had stories.

635
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,194
He'd sailed around Antarctica.

636
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,429
He was a war reporter.

637
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,756
He had lovers.

638
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,509
He wrote about his daughter.

639
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,276
He wrote about you?

640
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,955
Yeah. I grew up reading
about myself in his books.

641
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,030
How was that?

642
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,596
Not always easy.

643
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,389
A little more than you wanted
to know about yourself.

644
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,640
And then, when I was 17,

645
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,959
he had a heart attack.

646
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,914
Right at his keypad.

647
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,320
End of story.

648
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,835
That was so serious. I'm sorry.

649
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,795
We need more wine.

650
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,394
I like hearing about your life.

651
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,400
Thanks.

652
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,160
Why are we here?

653
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,356
You'll see.

654
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,039
Best show in town.

655
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,920
So you've done this before?

656
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,269
Yeah.

657
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,749
And it's safe?

658
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,110
No.

659
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,835
Reasonably safe.

660
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,671
Hop in. You're next.

661
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,270
What about my dress?

662
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,550
Right.

663
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,154
Turn around.

664
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,440
Tether attached.

665
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,033
What are you doing?

666
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,190
Do you trust me?

667
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,234
Thank you.

668
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,476
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

669
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,157
You kill me.

670
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,512
You okay?

671
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,000
Yeah.

672
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,439
I'm fine.

673
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,000
It's just...

674
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,153
Yeah, I know.

675
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,554
So, I'm seeing someone.

676
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,279
You'll never guess who.

677
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,952
We're the last two people in the world
who would ever get together.

678
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,313
But here we are.

679
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,800
The last two people in the world.

680
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,310
What's that?

681
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,834
I'm writing, Arthur. Hush.

682
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,193
Jim and I live in accidental happiness.

683
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,239
Like castaways,
making their home on strange shores.

684
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,471
"Strange shores." I love it.

685
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,789
You do? You don't have to say that.

686
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,997
- I know.
- You're not gonna eat this.

687
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,840
Does that seem fishy to you?

688
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:14,956
Keep reading.

689
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,234
It's funny.

690
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,913
We all have dreams.

691
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,112
We plan our futures
like we're the captains of our fates.

692
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,559
But we're passengers.

693
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,597
We go where fate takes us.

694
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:30,030
I can't

695
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,156
Help

696
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,230
Arthur!

697
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,840
This isn't the life we planned.

698
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,999
But it's ours.

699
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,640
And for the first time in my life,

700
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,393
I don't feel alone.

701
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,351
We weren't supposed to find each other.

702
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,394
But we did.

703
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,159
He makes me feel like my life isn't over.

704
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,437
Like it's just beginning.

705
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,350
How was your day?

706
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,432
Good. I wrote a few pages.

707
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,752
Did you find anything that can help us?

708
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,193
- I did.
- Are they real?

709
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,633
I cut them myself.

710
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,555
You know, for two unlucky people,

711
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,040
we sure got pretty lucky.

712
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,034
Attention.

713
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,790
You may wish to proceed to a viewing area.

714
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,237
The Avalon will slingshot
around the star Arcturus.

715
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,754
Look!

716
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,672
Oh, my God!

717
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,833
That was amazing.

718
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,353
A red giant.

719
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,997
The universe's present to you.

720
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,840
What?

721
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,958
Happy birthday.

722
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:36,335
Happy birthday to you

723
01:00:36,416 --> 01:00:40,313
Happy birthday to you

724
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,440
Happy birthday, dear Aurora

725
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,874
Happy birthday to you

726
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,870
A birthday drink for the birthday girl.

727
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,150
Aren't you going to ask for my ID?

728
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,356
I might not be old enough to drink.

729
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,909
I would never ask your age
in front of a gentleman.

730
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,840
Jim's no gentleman.

731
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,389
Anyway, there's no secrets
between me and Jim.

732
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:06,314
- Is that so?
- You heard the lady.

733
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,436
I will be right back.

734
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,400
This is a perfect birthday drink. Thank you.

735
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:28,598
I remember this day a year ago.

736
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,717
Jim was so looking forward to meeting you.

737
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:32,910
What?

738
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,638
How could he be looking forward to it?

739
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,394
He spent months deciding
whether to wake you up.

740
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,795
He couldn't stop talking about you.

741
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,679
Jim woke me up?

742
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:49,840
Yes.

743
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,474
He said it was
the hardest decision of his life.

744
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,115
But I see it worked out just fine.

745
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,760
What?

746
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,312
Did you wake me up?

747
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,110
Yes, I woke you up.

748
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,115
How...

749
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,035
How could you do it?

750
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,674
I tried not to.

751
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,794
I'm gonna be sick.

752
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,514
I can't see.

753
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:49,676
Aurora, please...

754
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,229
Stay away from me!

755
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,433
I can't get off this ship.

756
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,989
I can't get off this ship. I can't get off.

757
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:12,790
No!

758
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,276
Oh, God.

759
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,479
Can I talk to you?

760
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,793
Aurora,

761
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,152
I know nothing I can say will make this okay.

762
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:52,960
But please listen.

763
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,870
I was so alone

764
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:57,519
for so long.

765
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,269
It felt like I was disappearing.

766
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:05,113
The night I first saw you, I was ready to...

767
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:09,710
You saved my life.

768
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:16,078
And I know that's no excuse for what I did.

769
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,033
I read everything you wrote,

770
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:22,872
and I fell in love with your voice

771
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,999
and with the way your mind works.

772
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,550
I fell in love with you.

773
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,717
And all of a sudden,

774
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,879
it was like I wasn't trapped anymore.

775
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,152
My pointless life suddenly had meaning.

776
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,671
And I wish I could take it back.

777
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,720
But I can't.

778
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,714
Aurora, I don't want to lose you.

779
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,917
I don't care!

780
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,197
I don't care what you want!

781
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:57,115
I don't care why you woke me up!

782
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:00,274
You took my life!

783
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,873
Please stand by.

784
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,919
Your suite's control center is rebooting.

785
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,033
I envy you, Arthur.

786
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:06,750
How so?

787
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,993
You have a purpose.

788
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:12,670
You're always happy.

789
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,719
How's your book coming along?

790
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,198
I've never written about myself before.

791
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,718
I think it's some of the best work
I've ever done,

792
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,757
and I don't even know why I'm doing it.

793
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,834
There's only one person who could read it,
and I can't stand him.

794
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,557
They say time heals all wounds.

795
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,996
Broken hearts aren't that simple, Arthur.

796
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,240
You wouldn't understand.

797
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,560
Arthur!

798
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,713
Tuesday's my day with Arthur.

799
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,196
It's Wednesday.

800
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,470
The bar's all yours.

801
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,234
What'll you have? Whiskey?

802
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,394
Coffee.

803
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,080
Aurora! We love you!

804
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,231
What are we gonna do without you?
We'll miss you so...

805
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:22,434
You're the bravest woman I know.

806
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,920
Bye, Aurora!

807
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:27,990
I promise that I will think of you every day.

808
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,197
When you wake up, I'll be gone,

809
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:33,796
but just know that I will never forget you.

810
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,519
You're my best friend.

811
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,434
You were never happy here. I know.

812
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,637
Nothing was ever enough for you.

813
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:45,277
You know, you don't have to go.

814
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:48,558
You could do
whatever it is you have to do right here.

815
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,270
But...

816
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,038
Since you're going, here's my wish.

817
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:01,599
I hope you finally find someone
who fills your heart, and

818
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,237
I hope you let him in.

819
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,674
I hope you realize you don't have to do
something amazing to be happy.

820
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:14,755
You know, have fun,

821
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:17,233
take chances.

822
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:20,916
Okay.

823
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:23,794
I love you, Aurora.

824
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,835
Bye.

825
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,592
Morning, Arthur!

826
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,592
- Coffee, please.
- Coming up.

827
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,597
Are you soiling my barstool?

828
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:43,116
You want to make things,
you got to get your hands dirty.

829
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,150
And what have you been making?

830
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,040
Improvements.

831
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,032
Grand concourse.

832
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,520
First floor.

833
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,513
Gold-class breakfast.

834
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,634
This is Deck Chief Gus Mancuso.

835
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,273
Who the hell planted a tree on my ship?

836
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,632
- Who did that?
- I did.

837
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,230
Who are you?

838
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:22,590
Jim Preston.

839
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,230
Aurora Lane.

840
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,355
Anybody else awake?

841
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:28,954
Just me and him.

842
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,120
How far along are we?

843
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,149
Eighty-eight years to go.

844
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,752
Hibernation failure.

845
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,679
They said that couldn't happen.

846
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:49,992
Three people, three pod failures.

847
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,954
You have no idea
how long I've been trying to get in there.

848
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:00,351
Now that you're in, don't touch anything.

849
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,960
This is where you work?

850
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,271
No, this is flight crew. I'm a deck chief.

851
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,717
Ops, Navigation, Comm.

852
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,915
Unauthorized personnel.

853
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:14,636
Sorry.

854
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:20,352
If I'm reading this right,
we're still on course.

855
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:23,160
So whatever's wrong with the ship,
NavCom is still on the job.

856
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,515
There's something wrong with the ship?

857
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:27,195
Three pod failures?
Yeah, there's something wrong.

858
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,033
Question is what.

859
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,240
That's strange.

860
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:35,915
We should be getting diagnostics
from all over the ship right here,

861
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,832
but there's no data.

862
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,353
Got to check all the systems manually.

863
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,591
Can't we turn the ship around,
go back to Earth?

864
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,000
No, we're doing 50% of light speed.

865
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:47,390
Turning back would
take just as much time as going on.

866
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:49,199
Well, there's got to be something we can do.

867
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,676
Sorry. We're going where we're going.

868
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,230
You okay?

869
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,279
Hibernation hangover.

870
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,999
Get it all the time.

871
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:02,158
Grand concourse.

872
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,435
Two years?

873
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,432
Any more trees I need to know about?

874
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:06,510
Look out!

875
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,314
Never seen that before.

876
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,278
These robots have been breaking down.

877
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:18,000
This guy makes fifteen?

878
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:19,716
Fifteen.

879
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:21,234
The breakfast bar went crazy today.

880
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:23,630
- Yeah, and an elevator.
- Last week, my door broke.

881
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,916
- I was trapped in my cabin for two days.
- You were?

882
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:29,835
Things like that don't happen.
Not on this ship.

883
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,757
There are 16 of these tech stations
on every deck.

884
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:34,876
Dock your slate.

885
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,074
Data syncs automatically. Got it?

886
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:38,873
- Yeah.
- Okay.

887
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,396
You take decks one and two.
You take decks three and four.

888
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:45,394
I'm going down to the hibernation bay,
check our pods.

889
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:47,554
Well, that should be interesting.

890
01:14:58,280 --> 01:14:59,714
Ain't you supposed to be making your rounds?

891
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,429
I'm finished.

892
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,879
I checked your pod.

893
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,480
Problem's very simple.
The clock chip's burnt out.

894
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,314
It ain't supposed to happen,
but pretty simple.

895
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:14,880
My pod's more complicated.

896
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,839
Bunch of system failures that
all happened at the same time.

897
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,752
Whole damn thing went haywire.

898
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:23,918
Explains why I'm feeling so bad.

899
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:25,595
But Aurora's pod...

900
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,393
You did this.

901
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:34,830
Yeah.

902
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:37,355
All this time, I'm thinking
you're one lucky son of a bitch

903
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,079
to get stuck with Aurora.

904
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,392
It wasn't luck, was it?

905
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:45,950
No.

906
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,110
She knows?

907
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:48,956
She knows.

908
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,389
How long were you alone?

909
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,314
A year.

910
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,314
Still...

911
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:02,640
Damn.

912
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:10,079
Data received.

913
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:15,269
Data received.

914
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:22,197
- Data received.
- Same as Jim's.

915
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:23,475
Interpolating data.

916
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:25,597
System shutdowns...

917
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,956
Everywhere, but no apparent connection.

918
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,274
You saw the hibernation pods?

919
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:33,390
I saw them.

920
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:35,636
Data received.

921
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:36,995
So you know

922
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,350
what Jim did.

923
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:43,680
Yeah.

924
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:45,470
And?

925
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:48,390
- It's not my...
- He woke me up.

926
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:50,434
He took away my life.

927
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:52,591
I know, and I'm sorry,
but there's work I'd...

928
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,433
It's murder.

929
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:58,919
You're right, Aurora.

930
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,596
But the drowning man will always try
and drag somebody down with him.

931
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:05,315
It ain't right, but the man's drowning.

932
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,033
This one makes 16.

933
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,679
Hey. You okay?

934
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,909
- You should go rest.
- Yeah.

935
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:28,072
But just a couple hours, and then
back at it first thing in the morning.

936
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:16,799
I was in the pool when the gravity gave out.

937
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:17,996
Are you okay?

938
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,719
We need to find Gus.

939
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:22,959
Gus! Gus!

940
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:27,112
Gravity loss means that whatever's wrong
is starting to hit the big-ticket items.

941
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:28,429
Not good.

942
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:30,993
Every failure's a burnt out processor.

943
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,834
Everything on board's thinking too hard.

944
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:35,589
Why?

945
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:39,074
Computer, display these failures over time.

946
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,277
Processing timeline.

947
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,074
Cascade failure.

948
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:47,595
It started two years ago. Power surge.

949
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,711
Seventeen failures in one day.

950
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,597
Including hibernation pod 1498.

951
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:54,756
That's me.

952
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:56,874
Woke me up.

953
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,080
- What happened that day?
- Something big.

954
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:03,317
A major system went down somewhere.

955
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:06,076
Everything else on board
is trying to pick up the load,

956
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:07,879
but the load's too heavy.

957
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:09,792
Whatever started this, we got to find it.

958
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:10,996
And fix it.

959
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:12,400
How bad can this get?

960
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,996
Give me risk analysis based on this data.

961
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,116
Extrapolating.

962
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:20,315
A mission-critical failure is imminent.

963
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,359
Failing systems.
Life Support, Fusion Reactor...

964
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:24,596
So we're stranded.

965
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,637
Hibernation Bay, Ion Drive...

966
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,200
On a sinking ship.

967
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:39,072
Main Engineering.

968
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:42,039
Not a lot of things big enough
to hit this ship that hard.

969
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:47,720
With Diagnostics out,
we'll have to find it ourselves.

970
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:49,960
Where do we start?

971
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:52,354
Gus!

972
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:58,474
Scan complete. Analyzing data.

973
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,433
What's it say is wrong with me?

974
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:06,433
It's a few things.

975
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,113
612 disorders found.

976
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:10,515
Get me out of here.

977
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:26,674
What's the prognosis?

978
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:30,071
Critical diagnoses cannot be discussed
without a doctor in attendance.

979
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:35,160
Override on my authority. ID 2317.

980
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:36,469
Lay it on me, doc.

981
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,358
Pansystemic necrosis.

982
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:41,160
Progressive organ failure. Cause, unknown.

983
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:43,711
My goofy hibernation pod. That's the cause.

984
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:47,233
- What's the treatment?
- Various treatments are possible.

985
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:49,551
None will meaningfully extend
the patient's life.

986
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:54,636
How long have I got?

987
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:57,280
Your end-of-life transition
is already underway.

988
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:02,794
These sedatives will alleviate your suffering
during these final hours.

989
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:21,914
Gus.

990
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:28,353
I need a minute.

991
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:01,039
We are experiencing difficulties in flight.

992
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,032
- Gus!
- Gus!

993
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,190
Where could he be?

994
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:07,159
For your own safety,
please return to your cabins.

995
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:13,954
We are experiencing difficulties in flight.

996
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:17,590
For your own safety,
please return to your cabins.

997
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,513
Should've took the damn pills.

998
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:23,000
- I'll go get them.
- No. Stay here with me.

999
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,233
Sit down.

1000
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,631
You two take care of each other.

1001
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:43,560
My ID.

1002
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,869
Get you where you need to go.

1003
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,753
Fix the ship.

1004
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,991
Find out what's wrong with her.

1005
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:58,515
How do I look?

1006
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,518
You look magnificent.

1007
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:04,631
Ladies love the dress blues.

1008
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:15,270
What do we do now?

1009
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,075
This can't be good.

1010
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:29,153
I'm going back to Engineering.

1011
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:30,799
Can you fix this?

1012
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:32,874
I need your help.

1013
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:36,910
Let's go.

1014
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:00,916
Arthur!

1015
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,390
Let's go.

1016
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:23,472
Main Engineering.

1017
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:25,517
Can't we wake up some of the crew?

1018
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,910
It'll take them too long to recover.
We don't have that kind of time.

1019
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,434
What are we even looking for?

1020
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:33,233
Something broken. Something big.

1021
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,515
Come on.

1022
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,270
Is it broken?

1023
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,511
It seems okay. What's next?

1024
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,956
Power plant. This way.

1025
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:50,433
Come on.

1026
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,359
The whole section's closed off.
Something's wrong.

1027
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,039
We're looking for wrong.

1028
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:55,110
Try to open it.

1029
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:10,034
Warning. Pressure fault.

1030
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:12,072
Lockdown initiated.

1031
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:18,358
- Please secure all doors.
- Hold on!

1032
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,560
Warning. Dangerous oxygen level.

1033
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:25,597
Please secure all doors.

1034
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,238
Dangerous oxygen level.

1035
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:39,437
Please secure all doors.

1036
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:44,909
Grab it!

1037
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:54,713
Pressurizing cabin unsuccessful.

1038
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,873
Pressure normalized.

1039
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,878
Oxygen level restored.

1040
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:09,952
- There's a...
- End lockdown.

1041
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:11,872
A hole in the ship.

1042
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:15,550
More than one.

1043
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:22,114
How did that even happen?
The ship's supposed to be meteor-proof.

1044
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:23,236
I guess one got through.

1045
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,556
It's hot.

1046
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:41,110
I think we found it.

1047
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,069
It's the reactor-control computer.

1048
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,559
This is what hit us two years ago.

1049
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:02,994
Jim...

1050
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:04,880
How can we fix this?

1051
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:09,750
We're gonna die.

1052
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,599
There's replacement parts for everything.

1053
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,432
- Light.
- Sorry.

1054
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:23,400
Soon as I pull this module,
the entire computer's gonna shut down.

1055
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:25,312
Well, what happens then?

1056
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,519
I'll get it back up as quickly as I can.

1057
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:34,270
Hurry!

1058
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:38,633
- Jim!
- Okay.

1059
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:42,794
Control computer restored.

1060
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:45,955
Venting reactor.

1061
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:50,995
- But we fixed it!
- Reactor vent failed.

1062
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:53,436
Manual override required.

1063
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:00,310
Vent failure.

1064
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:01,993
- Come on!
- Jim.

1065
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:08,639
Outer door nonresponsive.

1066
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:10,473
What does that mean?

1067
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:14,038
The outer door is jammed.

1068
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:16,032
We've got to open that door
and cool the reactor down,

1069
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:17,474
or the whole ship is gonna blow.

1070
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:20,316
- How?
- I got to go out there.

1071
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:21,993
Open it from the outside.

1072
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,519
I open the door, I get clear.

1073
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:28,599
- You blow that fire into space.
- You get clear?

1074
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:30,239
You can talk to me through this.

1075
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:32,352
What happens to you when that door opens?

1076
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,354
Heat shield. It might help.

1077
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:55,239
You might need this.

1078
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:09,910
It's gonna be okay.

1079
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:21,310
I better go.

1080
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:29,075
Jim. Jim.

1081
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:33,914
Come back to me.

1082
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,717
I can't live on the ship without you.

1083
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,190
Warning.

1084
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:06,078
Temperature critical.

1085
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:20,794
What's wrong?

1086
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:22,350
What's the matter?

1087
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:23,920
- Are you okay?
- Nothing.

1088
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,798
- Go.
- You sure?

1089
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:27,195
Go.

1090
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:35,990
I'm at the vent tube.

1091
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:39,757
New anchor point. Reset tether.

1092
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:44,916
I see the door.

1093
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:48,078
Temperature level rising.

1094
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:57,272
Warning. Temperature critical.

1095
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:05,753
Containment unstable.

1096
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:09,836
- Where are you?
- I'm at the door.

1097
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:11,400
I'm ready. Just say when.

1098
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:12,510
Here goes.

1099
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:17,350
The door won't open.

1100
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:19,159
I'll have to bypass it.

1101
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:23,358
Temperature level rising.

1102
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:25,596
Jim, come on!

1103
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:27,200
Please hurry!

1104
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:29,791
- Okay, I'm trying it again.
- Tell me when you're clear.

1105
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:35,670
- No!
- What?

1106
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:38,196
What's going on?

1107
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:40,509
Jim?

1108
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:45,556
Jim!

1109
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:47,195
The door won't stay open.

1110
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:50,350
I think I have to stay here.

1111
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:52,240
Hold the door open.

1112
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:53,550
What?

1113
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:54,710
No!

1114
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:56,520
No way! Get out of there!

1115
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:58,114
I can't.

1116
01:33:58,200 --> 01:33:59,554
Jim.

1117
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:00,910
We're out of time.

1118
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:05,235
- Containment unstable.
- Jim?

1119
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:13,116
Vent the reactor.

1120
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:22,396
No! You don't understand!

1121
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:25,880
If I open the door right now, it'll kill you!

1122
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:26,950
I'm hoping not.

1123
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:28,912
Come back in. We'll think of something else.

1124
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,400
There is nothing else.

1125
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:32,876
Jim!

1126
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:35,070
- It's okay.
- No!

1127
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:36,992
- It's not okay!
- Aurora...

1128
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:38,878
Warning. Temperature level exceeded.

1129
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:40,958
This isn't what you said was gonna happen!

1130
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:43,994
Aurora, this ship is gonna go.

1131
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:46,072
I don't care! You die, I die.

1132
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:49,760
There are 5,000 other people
on this ship, Aurora.

1133
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:52,390
We have to do this.

1134
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,434
Maximum pressure reached.

1135
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,117
Do it. Now.

1136
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,917
Maximum cabin pressure reached.

1137
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:27,874
Temperature dropping.

1138
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:30,470
Jim.

1139
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:51,277
- Jim?
- Vent successful.

1140
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:53,875
Rebooting process initiated.

1141
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:55,030
Jim, please say something.

1142
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:34,319
Suit pressure dropping.

1143
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:40,195
Return to ship immediately.

1144
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:42,276
Aurora?

1145
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:45,950
It worked!

1146
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:47,394
You did it! You can come in!

1147
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:50,238
Yeah, about that.

1148
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,437
What's the matter? Are you hurt?

1149
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:54,239
I got blown out of the tube.

1150
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:55,959
- What?
- My tether broke.

1151
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:58,231
I can't get back to the ship.

1152
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:00,752
I'll come out. I'll come out.
I'll pull you in.

1153
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:03,520
Warning. Oxygen level critical.

1154
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:05,837
Return to ship immediately.

1155
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:17,080
Aurora, I'm sorry.

1156
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:20,070
For everything.

1157
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:22,436
Shut up. I'm coming.

1158
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:26,594
I wish we'd have met in 90 years.

1159
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:34,953
I'd have built you a house.

1160
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:41,752
I'd have read your book.

1161
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:45,600
It's gonna be great.

1162
01:37:58,200 --> 01:37:59,190
Tether attached.

1163
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:01,313
Locate Jim Preston.

1164
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,469
Jim Preston located.

1165
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:10,960
I'm coming to get you.

1166
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:37,474
Jim!

1167
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:39,278
I'm sorry. The patient is dead.

1168
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:41,518
Well, resuscitate him!

1169
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:44,638
Postmortem operations require
authorized medical supervision.

1170
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:46,518
No.

1171
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:48,560
Jim.

1172
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:55,470
Override!

1173
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:56,994
Override on my authority!

1174
01:39:57,080 --> 01:39:59,914
ID 1-7...

1175
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:03,673
Two...

1176
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:05,319
Two. Two.

1177
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:06,595
2-3-1-7.

1178
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:09,549
2-3-1-7! ID 2-3-1-7!

1179
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,590
Resuscitation.

1180
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,831
Multiple procedures are not recommended.

1181
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:22,276
Override! Do it now!

1182
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:23,990
Executing.

1183
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:21,310
Hi!

1184
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:24,270
Jim!

1185
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:28,395
Hey, Jim.

1186
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:58,357
You brought me back.

1187
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:00,120
Yeah.

1188
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:26,317
- Thank you.
- Be still.

1189
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:27,915
Of course.

1190
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:15,153
There's something I have to show you.

1191
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:16,669
In command mode, it turns out

1192
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:20,993
the Autodoc has an option
called Stabilize and Suspend.

1193
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:23,636
It stops all metabolic activity.

1194
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:26,510
What are you saying?

1195
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:30,397
With Gus's ID, it can be like hibernation
inside the Autodoc.

1196
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:31,470
You can go back to sleep.

1197
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:38,472
But there's only one Autodoc.

1198
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:44,314
Yeah.

1199
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:50,394
And you're gonna lay down in it
and fall asleep.

1200
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:53,751
And you'll wake up on Homestead II.

1201
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,638
And you'll write your book.

1202
01:43:57,320 --> 01:43:58,390
You'd finish your journey.

1203
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:00,358
You'd do what you set out to do.

1204
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,673
You'd be alone.

1205
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,719
I've been alone before.

1206
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:15,469
And I'll be fine.

1207
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:18,993
But I would never see you again.

1208
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:24,354
I'll come and visit you.

1209
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:09,039
Tuesday is my day with Arthur.

1210
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:12,714
Lovely as ever.

1211
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:15,031
Thank you, Arthur.
You're looking very well yourself.

1212
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:16,554
Thanks to you.

1213
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:18,550
What's that?

1214
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:23,592
Something I've wanted to give you
for a long time.

1215
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:32,553
It's beautiful.

1216
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:47,751
Took you long enough to ask.

1217
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:52,274
Champagne.

1218
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:53,876
I'll wait.

1219
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:12,958
Hell of a life.

1220
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:16,954
Hell of a life.

1221
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:51,836
Crew wake-up process initiated.

1222
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:54,318
My fellow passengers,

1223
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:55,834
if you're reading this,

1224
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:59,675
then the Starship Avalon
has reached its destination.

1225
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:02,036
Grand concourse.

1226
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:03,952
A lot happened while you slept.

1227
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:13,518
A friend once said,

1228
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:16,672
"You can't get so hung up
on where you'd rather be

1229
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:19,832
"that you forget to make
the most of where you are."

1230
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:22,877
We got lost along the way.

1231
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:25,553
But we found each other.

1232
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:28,079
And we made a life.

1233
01:47:28,160 --> 01:47:30,277
A beautiful life.

1234
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:32,353
Together.
