<i>Report suspicious activity

00:02:18,852 --> 00:02:21,088
<i>Health and safety is here to help.</i>

5
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:23,947
<i>Just look for the black and white vests.</i>

6
00:02:27,593 --> 00:02:30,586
- After you.
- Thank you.

7
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,596
<i>This train serves
the north-east work sectors.</i>

8
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,850
<i>This is a message from the Collective.</i>

9
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,188
<i>Are you overly tired?
Or experiencing increased sensitivity?</i>

10
00:02:54,288 --> 00:02:56,824
<i>Maybe you have difficulty concentrating.</i>

11
00:02:56,924 --> 00:03:01,050
<i>You may have S.O.S. Switched On Syndrome.</i>

<i>...a further 43 degrees along this orbit</i>

17
00:03:50,511 --> 00:03:53,280
<i>And event that changed the course

18
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,988
<i>and now known as the great war.</i>

19
00:03:56,088 --> 00:03:59,153
<i>...of the two tracts of land
that survived the great war.</i>

20
00:03:59,253 --> 00:04:02,856
<i>The Peninsula still stands 44 degrees
west of the Collective.</i>

21
00:04:02,956 --> 00:04:08,618
<i>And is a wild primitive area,
containing empty, dilapidated buildings...</i>

22
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,934
<i>...and little is known of the primitive
nature of the Peninsula's inhabitants.</i>

23
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:17,438
<i>The defects living there are ruled
by emotion and base desires.</i>

24
00:04:17,538 --> 00:04:19,540
<i>An ancient vestige of our past.</i>

25
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,578
<i>This image shows Equis 12 leaving Earth's

<i>Who wrote the text for this feature?</i>

27
00:04:27,713 --> 00:04:30,049
Me, I did.

28
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:33,676
- Does this accurate, Nia?
- Yes.

29
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,225
Except the rocket's fission thrusters
are cylindrical, these appear triangular.

30
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:41,050
Thank you. I'll change that.

31
00:05:02,648 --> 00:05:05,657
Iris is back from conception duty.

32
00:05:08,588 --> 00:05:10,990
She got back yesterday.

33
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,992
She had a defect.

34
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:15,027
How do you know?

35
00:05:15,127 --> 00:05:18,165
- She told me.
- Did she have the bug?

36
00:05:18,265 --> 00:05:20,806
No. She says she's clean.

37
00:05:22,468 --> 00:05:24,838
Where is everyone watching
the landing tomorrow night?

38
00:05:24,938 --> 00:05:29,209
I'm watching it in Bishop Park. I'm going
to leave work early to get a good seat.

39
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:33,066
If I arrive early enough I can get
a seat close to the screen.

40
00:05:55,234 --> 00:05:56,975
David!

41
00:05:57,136 --> 00:05:58,945

<i>Total number of puzzles solved, 2224.</i>

46

<i>The following is an update on last night's
disturbance in living block 5-J.</i>

47
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,071
<i>Health and safety officials subdued two
individuals engaged in coupling activities.</i>

48
00:07:38,171 --> 00:07:42,524
<i>And both have been transported to the
defective, emotional, neuropathy facility,</i>

49
00:07:42,624 --> 00:07:46,413
<i>the den, for containment
and emotional suppression treatment.</i>

50
00:07:46,513 --> 00:07:49,483
<i>The incident is an outbreak
of defective behavior.</i>

51
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:53,487
<i>Remember, couplers are a danger
to themselves and to all of us.</i>

52
00:07:53,587 --> 00:07:57,507
<i>Physical contact, touching,
or displays of emotions</i>

53
00:07:57,607 --> 00:08:00,594
<i>are signs of an individual
infected with S.O.S.</i>

54
00:08:00,694 --> 00:08:04,748
<i>If you see the signs, report the couplers
to health and safety immediately.</i>

55
00:08:04,848 --> 00:08:08,891
<i>Let's do our part to help contain
this dangerous epidemic.</i>

56
00:08:14,462 --> 00:08:18,211
<i>...with no infrastructure
the Collective erected a patrolled border</i>

57
00:08:18,311 --> 00:08:21,587
<i>to contain any resurgence of chaos...</i>

58
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:29,595
- Did anybody see that?
- See what?

59
00:08:44,703 --> 00:08:47,341
- That's unfortunate.
- He's already dead.

60
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:49,733
- Anyone recognize him?
- Not sure.

61
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:53,247
- Don't think so.
- That's our first jumper in a while.

62
00:08:53,347 --> 00:08:55,682
His head was no match for that concrete.

63
00:08:55,782 --> 00:08:59,052
I just remembered there was a suicide
in my building last night,

64
00:08:59,152 --> 00:09:00,687
a woman slit her throat.

65
00:09:00,787 --> 00:09:04,029
I hope they find someone
to cover his work.

66
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:33,654
<i>Even before the demise, humankind knew
the importance of space exploration.</i>

67
00:09:33,754 --> 00:09:37,658
<i>As the Collective,
we prioritize it and perfect it.</i>

68
00:09:37,758 --> 00:09:41,469
<i>Now, 798 million miles away,</i>

69
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:44,592

70
00:09:44,692 --> 00:09:48,335
<i>we move one step further in our

71
00:09:48,435 --> 00:09:50,637
<i>Okay, everybody, this is it.</i>

72
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:54,880
<i>3... 2... 1... Mark.</i>

73
00:11:29,251 --> 00:11:33,824
Last but not least. Speculative non-fiction,
the title is inside the Peninsula.

74
00:11:33,924 --> 00:11:37,532
Silas, will you talk us
through the lead illustration?

75
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,885
Silas?

76
00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:44,049
Sorry, Leonard.

77
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:47,320
I went with the scene on the Peninsula where
the defects huddle together for warmth.

78
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,890
In my research I found that they form
social bonds with each other

79
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,125
to help alleviate
something called anxiety.

80
00:11:52,225 --> 00:11:55,701
- Very good.
- Thank you.

81
00:13:12,204 --> 00:13:16,692
<i>While scientists are making great strides in
understanding this debilitating condition.</i>

82
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:20,213
<i>A reliable cure for S.O.S.
has yet to be found.</i>

83
00:13:20,313 --> 00:13:24,551
<i>And most S.O.S. sufferers will experience

<i>In as little as four to six months.</i>

85

<i>Prior to eventual containment at the den,</i>

86
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:33,092
<i>Kappa Rho inhibitors offer a reliable
means of dampening symptoms,</i>

87
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:35,462
<i>and slowing the stages of the disease.</i>

88
00:13:35,562 --> 00:13:39,104
- <i>Thus allowing sufferers to maintain...</i>
- What stage?

89
00:13:40,065 --> 00:13:43,068
- Excuse me?
- What stage are you?

90
00:13:43,969 --> 00:13:47,207
Oh, I'm just here for a check up.
Strictly precautionary.

91
00:13:49,608 --> 00:13:51,683
I'm Jonas.

92
00:13:51,844 --> 00:13:53,711
Silas.

93
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:58,256
What stage are you?

94
00:13:58,517 --> 00:14:00,358
Two.

95
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,495
You look healthy.

96
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:07,999
Well, I have my good days and my bad days.

97
00:14:10,662 --> 00:14:13,471
- Silas?
- Good luck.

98
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,193
Thank you.

99
00:14:17,002 --> 00:14:19,271
The ground was rushing towards me.

100
00:14:19,371 --> 00:14:21,612
I couldn't breathe.

101
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,250
I felt like my stomach was...

102
00:14:26,011 --> 00:14:28,915
it was in my mouth.
It was extremely unpleasant.

103
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:31,589
You had a nightmare, Silas.

104
00:14:33,185 --> 00:14:36,455
I never want to experience
anything like it again.

105
00:14:36,555 --> 00:14:38,724
How long have you had these symptoms?

106
00:14:38,824 --> 00:14:41,728
Maybe three days. No longer than that.

107
00:14:41,828 --> 00:14:44,218
I'm going to take some blood now.

108
00:14:45,631 --> 00:14:48,322
Can you give me your hand please, Silas?

109
00:14:57,009 --> 00:14:59,378
Your test is positive, Silas.

110
00:14:59,478 --> 00:15:01,869
You're only stage one.

111
00:15:03,582 --> 00:15:07,442
A woman in my office recently
gave birth to a defect, I...

112
00:15:08,053 --> 00:15:10,423
I couldn't have caught it from her.
Not if she's clean, right?

113
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:14,527
Even if this woman did have S.O.S.,
it isn't contagious.

114
00:15:14,627 --> 00:15:17,230
I'd like to start you on a full course
of inhibitors immediately.

115
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,233
There's no reason why you shouldn't
be able to live a normal life.

116
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,401
At least for a while.

117
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:25,605
- And the den.
- You mustn't think about that for now.

118
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:30,164
The den is a long way off for you.
A cure is right around the corner.

119
00:16:00,272 --> 00:16:02,696
Where were you, Silas?

120
00:16:03,108 --> 00:16:05,980
I went to the cafeteria to drink some tea.

121
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:09,147
Is that where you got the bruise?

122
00:16:09,247 --> 00:16:14,175
No. Last night in Tai Chi class, the man
next to me accidentally struck me.

123
00:16:14,753 --> 00:16:17,023
Silas, you weren't
in Tai Chi class last night.

124
00:16:17,123 --> 00:16:19,324
Yes, he was.

125
00:16:19,424 --> 00:16:21,682
I saw him.

126
00:16:42,097 --> 00:16:44,188
What's that?

127
00:16:47,185 --> 00:16:48,904
It's a bumblebee.

128
00:16:49,254 --> 00:16:52,233
Careful. Don't they sting?

129
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,469
According to the laws of aerodynamics
they shouldn't even fly.

130
00:17:07,372 --> 00:17:11,432
But they don't know it.
So they fly anyway.

131
00:17:58,624 --> 00:18:03,079
<i>Be part of the solution by taking your
inhibitors. Your health is the health...</i>

132
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:05,236
Picking up.

133
00:18:10,335 --> 00:18:15,141
<i>If you're watching this film,
your doctor has diagnosed you with S.O.S.</i>

134
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:17,143
<i>Switched On Syndrome.</i>

135
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:21,548
<i>As members of the Collective,
we hear a lot about Switched On Syndrome.</i>

136
00:18:21,648 --> 00:18:26,152
<i>Here is important information about how
this debilitating disease will affect you.</i>

137
00:18:26,252 --> 00:18:29,555
<i>And how you can manage it responsibly
before eventual containment</i>

138
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:34,249
<i>at the defective emotional
neuropathy facility, the den.</i>

139
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:38,214
<i>Switched On Syndrome
is a malfunction of the gene silencing</i>

140
00:18:38,314 --> 00:18:41,868
<i>that controls human emotions
and eliminates human flaws.</i>

141
00:18:41,968 --> 00:18:46,272
<i>But in Switched On Syndrome, problem
genes lose their silencing and re-awaken.</i>

142
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:51,611
<i>Leading to unpredictable sensory
experiences and behavioral defects.</i>

143
00:18:51,711 --> 00:18:53,146
<i>Until a cure is available.</i>

144
00:18:53,246 --> 00:18:57,050
<i>Inhibitors are the only effective means
of slowing the disease's staging,</i>

145
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,174
<i>while dampening the onset of emotion.</i>

146
00:19:00,285 --> 00:19:02,288
<i>And while the causes are unknown,</i>

147
00:19:02,388 --> 00:19:05,746
<i>we do understand
the disease's progression.</i>

148
00:19:06,191 --> 00:19:08,852
<i>During stage one, intermittent feeling,</i>

149
00:19:08,952 --> 00:19:12,398
<i>you will experience
difficulty concentrating,</i>

150
00:19:12,498 --> 00:19:16,336
<i>depression, pain, overwhelmed feelings,</i>

151
00:19:16,536 --> 00:19:20,661
<i>impulsivity and sensitivity to light.</i>

152
00:19:21,273 --> 00:19:23,876
<i>As the disease progresses
into further stages,</i>

153
00:19:24,026 --> 00:19:27,180
<i>consistent low level emotion
and emotional volatility,</i>

154
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,081
<i>these symptoms will worsen.</i>

155
00:19:29,181 --> 00:19:32,285
<i>In stage four, acute behavioral chaos,</i>

156
00:19:32,385 --> 00:19:35,455
<i>you will no longer function as
a productive member of the Collective.</i>

157
00:19:35,555 --> 00:19:38,191
<i>And your doctor will prescribe
containment at the den.</i>

158
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,693
<i>Where you will be provided
with electro restraint,</i>

159
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:44,963
<i>emotional suppression,
and a pain-free death scenario.</i>

160
00:19:45,063 --> 00:19:47,267
<i>If you have questions
about your condition,</i>

161
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:51,170
<i>notify your doctor or health and safety
official for immediate attention.</i>

162
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,763
<i>And remember,
a cure is right around the corner.</i>

163
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,044
Hello, Silas.

164
00:20:32,144 --> 00:20:34,268
Hello, Nia.

165
00:22:02,492 --> 00:22:05,047
- Individuals no longer...
- Nia...

166
00:22:06,838 --> 00:22:09,409
I read your article
on the Harlow Nine probe.

167
00:22:09,509 --> 00:22:12,478
I was wondering if you
could look over my impressions.

168
00:22:12,578 --> 00:22:15,369
But you're speculative non-fiction.

169
00:22:15,747 --> 00:22:18,105
I switched with Leonard.

170
00:22:19,484 --> 00:22:21,342
Why?

171
00:22:22,954 --> 00:22:25,142
I felt like a change.

172
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:30,479
There's a staff meeting
tomorrow afternoon.

173
00:22:30,579 --> 00:22:33,031
Why don't I review your work then?

174
00:22:33,131 --> 00:22:37,440
I'd really appreciate your input at this
early stage, if it's not too much trouble.

175
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,636
This isn't what I described.

176
00:23:11,736 --> 00:23:15,262
- Isn't it?
- Harlow Nine is a lander not an orbiter.

177
00:23:16,475 --> 00:23:19,767
- And where's its robotic arm?
- Are those for a feature?

178
00:23:20,645 --> 00:23:21,447
Yes.

179
00:23:21,547 --> 00:23:23,316
I thought you were
speculative non-fiction.

180
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:25,839
I switched with Leonard.

181
00:23:26,718 --> 00:23:29,672
One more thing. The Eleos landing
was made on a flat surface.

182
00:23:29,772 --> 00:23:31,841
The way you've drawn it,
it looks almost mountainous.

183
00:23:31,941 --> 00:23:34,765
Is there anything else
I can help you with, Silas?

184
00:23:36,861 --> 00:23:39,286
Thank you for your feedback.

185
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:44,158
You're welcome.

186
00:24:41,226 --> 00:24:43,862
<i>It's this vastness...</i>

187
00:24:44,262 --> 00:24:47,187
<i>inaccessibility, symmetry...</i>

188
00:24:47,465 --> 00:24:50,769
<i>and the permanence of the night sky
that made it a natural topic</i>

189
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:54,873
<i>for philosophers pursuing
the understanding of ultimate reality.</i>

190
00:24:54,973 --> 00:24:57,464
<i>It's this vastness...</i>

191
00:24:57,843 --> 00:25:00,768
<i>inaccessibility, symmetry...</i>

192
00:25:01,481 --> 00:25:03,649
<i>and permanence of the night sky</i>

193
00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:07,074
<i>that made it a natural topic
for philosophers...</i>

194
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:17,197
At Atmos our past is not a relic
we should leave behind.

195
00:25:17,297 --> 00:25:20,399
But a living creation,
something to be handled.

196
00:25:20,499 --> 00:25:24,238
The work we do at Atmos
is that which links our present.

197
00:25:26,438 --> 00:25:28,862
I'm so sorry.

198
00:25:32,243 --> 00:25:34,668
You dropped these.

199
00:25:36,447 --> 00:25:38,272
Thank you.

200
00:25:47,192 --> 00:25:52,170
It's about time you all knew.
Last week I... tested positive for S.O.S.

201
00:25:54,466 --> 00:25:57,958
I'm stage one. I'm taking inhibitors.

202
00:25:58,536 --> 00:26:00,983
There is no evidence that the bug
is contagious. However...

203
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:04,076
if it makes you feel more comfortable,
I'll wear a face mask from now on.

204
00:26:04,176 --> 00:26:08,469
- Silas, I'm very sorry.
- How long do you have?

205
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,217
It's difficult to say.

206
00:26:11,317 --> 00:26:14,353
Is this why you stopped doing
speculative non-fiction?

207
00:26:14,453 --> 00:26:16,777
I don't know, Rachel.

208
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:19,458
Possibly.

209
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:23,362
A face mask is a little extreme. Although I
don't think he should sit with us anymore.

210
00:26:23,462 --> 00:26:26,220
And you should have your own mug.

211
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:30,924
Do you all agree?

212
00:26:33,005 --> 00:26:35,608
We cured cancer. We cured the common cold.

213
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:40,734
We can cure S.O.S.
You're going to live, pal.

214
00:26:42,114 --> 00:26:44,371
Thank you all.

215
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,352
This has to stop.

216
00:27:34,232 --> 00:27:37,102
If it continues I'll be forced
to report you.

217
00:27:37,202 --> 00:27:39,292
Do you understand?

218
00:27:44,642 --> 00:27:47,634
You have the bug. Don't you?

219
00:27:48,246 --> 00:27:50,247
I'm clean.

220
00:27:54,152 --> 00:27:57,411
The day that man
jumped off the building...

221
00:27:57,656 --> 00:28:00,914
you saw his body out the window, you...

222
00:28:03,328 --> 00:28:05,019
you looked...

223
00:28:05,964 --> 00:28:07,821
affected.

224
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:11,038
There have been other times, too.
I've been watching you.

225
00:28:11,138 --> 00:28:14,123
The way you look at the world,
the way you experience things.

226
00:28:14,223 --> 00:28:16,280
I'm clean.

227
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,467
It's different.

228
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,738
What you are going through
must be very difficult.

229
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:28,187
If you were clean, this conversation
wouldn't even be taking place.

230
00:28:28,287 --> 00:28:30,555
You'd have reported me already.

231
00:28:30,655 --> 00:28:32,779
Am I right?

232
00:28:35,126 --> 00:28:37,351
Goodnight, Silas.

233
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:49,530
- Good morning, Silas.
- Good morning, Nia.

234
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:17,924
And finally, the Harlow landing.

235
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:21,640
Nia, do you have any more notes for me?

236
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,859
No. Your changes work well. Thank you.

237
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:27,550
Onto the next article then. Zoe?

238
00:29:27,712 --> 00:29:30,957
These are my impressions of the hot
flow anomaly on the planet BL4.

239
00:29:31,057 --> 00:29:33,340
The visible bioshock...

240
00:30:07,151 --> 00:30:10,981
- Goodnight, Nia.
- Goodnight, Rachel.

241
00:33:34,942 --> 00:33:37,067
Your bruise went away.

242
00:33:37,962 --> 00:33:39,833
You noticed that?

243
00:33:43,134 --> 00:33:46,504
I've had the bug a year and three months.

244
00:33:46,604 --> 00:33:49,474
I didn't want to go to the doctor.
I just sort of knew.

245
00:33:49,574 --> 00:33:53,967
You know there is really nothing
any... anyone could do to help.

246
00:33:56,547 --> 00:34:00,172
And I'm scared of the meds and then...

247
00:34:04,889 --> 00:34:07,347
Doesn't seem fair at first.

248
00:34:07,825 --> 00:34:09,363
Right?

249
00:34:13,531 --> 00:34:15,834
You know I could live...
I could live with it.

250
00:34:15,934 --> 00:34:18,137
But every day was different
and that was the hardest part.

251
00:34:18,237 --> 00:34:21,962
Every single time I thought I knew
something or learned anything, I...

252
00:34:27,211 --> 00:34:28,405
didn't.

253
00:34:30,514 --> 00:34:33,752
And I felt this guilt every time
I wanted to go back to normal.

254
00:34:33,852 --> 00:34:36,743
Like I shouldn't want that.

255
00:34:37,922 --> 00:34:42,682
Every day I am practicing
unbearable discipline and self-control.

256
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:48,621
You realize what would happen
if anyone saw us in here right now?

257
00:34:52,036 --> 00:34:55,094
We'd go straight to the den.
It's a death sentence.

258
00:34:56,774 --> 00:35:00,111
One of my neighbors missed
two doctor's appointments.

259
00:35:00,211 --> 00:35:02,618
I haven't seen him in six weeks.

260
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:08,691
We can't do this again.

261
00:35:10,588 --> 00:35:14,163
It can't happen, you know that.

262
00:35:23,234 --> 00:35:25,274
We just...

263
00:35:26,637 --> 00:35:29,478
We just have to hold out for the cure.

264
00:35:37,715 --> 00:35:40,623
Will you stay in here with me
a little longer?

265
00:36:20,057 --> 00:36:22,860
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

266
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,234
I need to go.

267
00:36:39,743 --> 00:36:42,915
Nia, are you staying late again tonight?

268
00:36:43,015 --> 00:36:47,303
- I'm not sure.
- I wish I had your kind of work ethic.

269
00:36:48,586 --> 00:36:50,222
I received a message from Zoe.

270
00:36:50,322 --> 00:36:53,859
On her way to work this morning
she received a conception duty summons.

271
00:36:53,959 --> 00:36:56,561
Could one of the illustrators
present for her in the staff meeting?

272
00:36:56,661 --> 00:36:59,835
I'll do it. I'll be glad to.

273
00:37:10,674 --> 00:37:13,449
- Good night, Nia.
- Good night, Kate.

274
00:37:17,248 --> 00:37:21,123
They may simply be labeled as dualist.

275
00:37:22,753 --> 00:37:26,723
Two subject concepts and materialist
one subject concepts.

276
00:37:43,275 --> 00:37:46,049
The way you've been looking at me...

277
00:37:46,978 --> 00:37:49,180
I can't help it.

278
00:37:50,314 --> 00:37:52,555
I can feel it.

279
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,561
What does it feel like?

280
00:38:02,092 --> 00:38:04,467
It feels just wrong.

281
00:38:08,532 --> 00:38:11,702
No, no. No.

282
00:38:11,802 --> 00:38:15,277
It's not wrong.
It's completely right. This feels...

283
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,281
completely right.

284
00:38:48,272 --> 00:38:50,274
I'm scared.

285
00:38:50,374 --> 00:38:52,643
I'm so scared.

286
00:38:52,743 --> 00:38:54,751
Me too.

287
00:40:31,342 --> 00:40:33,549
Hello, Leonard.

288
00:40:33,944 --> 00:40:35,785
Silas.

289
00:40:36,747 --> 00:40:40,222
I didn't expect to see you here this late.

290
00:40:43,687 --> 00:40:46,957
Have you thought about killing yourself?

291
00:40:47,057 --> 00:40:50,366
No, that's not until stage three.

292
00:40:56,133 --> 00:40:58,908
Why is Nia's interface on?

293
00:41:00,738 --> 00:41:03,846
Have you been snooping again, Silas?

294
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:06,144
Excuse me?

295
00:41:06,244 --> 00:41:10,115
A month ago, health and safety
saw you on Nia's interface after-hours.

296
00:41:10,215 --> 00:41:13,150
I was told to keep an eye on you.

297
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:16,291
Is there something you want to tell me?

298
00:41:18,389 --> 00:41:20,058
As the manager here at Atmos,

299
00:41:20,158 --> 00:41:24,295
one of my duties is to maintain
the safety and welfare of the team.

300
00:41:24,395 --> 00:41:28,133
Therefore, if I believe that someone
on the team is in danger,

301
00:41:28,233 --> 00:41:32,369
or involved in an activity that is unsafe,

302
00:41:32,469 --> 00:41:35,272
I'd report him, or her,

303
00:41:35,372 --> 00:41:37,541
to health and safety.

304
00:41:37,641 --> 00:41:41,183
Unless, of course,
the activity were to stop.

305
00:41:42,546 --> 00:41:44,620
Does that make sense to you?

306
00:41:47,051 --> 00:41:48,553
Yes.

307
00:41:49,053 --> 00:41:50,888
Good.

308
00:41:51,538 --> 00:41:53,947
Shall we get out of here, Silas?

309
00:42:36,834 --> 00:42:39,842
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Nia.

310
00:43:23,113 --> 00:43:25,254
He knows.

311
00:43:28,285 --> 00:43:30,760
What are we going to do?

312
00:43:36,226 --> 00:43:39,068
We have to stay away from each other.

313
00:43:41,432 --> 00:43:45,236
I can't... stay away from you. I can't...

314
00:43:45,336 --> 00:43:47,404
not be around you.

315
00:43:47,504 --> 00:43:51,380
Not in that office. Not when
I see you everyday. It's impossible.

316
00:43:57,581 --> 00:44:00,118
I thought about it. The best thing
is for me to leave Atmos.

317
00:44:00,218 --> 00:44:02,691
Get a job somewhere else.

318
00:44:15,065 --> 00:44:17,067
It's like you said...

319
00:44:17,167 --> 00:44:20,709
we have to hold on for the cure.
That's all we should be thinking about.

320
00:44:32,883 --> 00:44:34,724
Nia...

321
00:45:29,907 --> 00:45:32,477
<i>Have you received
a conception duty summons?</i>

322
00:45:32,577 --> 00:45:35,479
<i>Let's work together
to populate the Collective.</i>

323
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:38,016
<i>Insemination is quick and solitary,</i>

324
00:45:38,116 --> 00:45:42,153
<i>and during gestation you'll be supporting
and growing the Collective.</i>

325
00:45:42,253 --> 00:45:45,261
<i>If you received a summons please...</i>

326
00:45:50,761 --> 00:45:53,363
Are you sure this is what you want?

327
00:45:53,463 --> 00:45:54,965
I'm sure.

328
00:45:55,065 --> 00:45:57,655
Positions at Atmos are highly coveted.
Once we've placed you...

329
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,038
I understand.

330
00:46:02,272 --> 00:46:04,375
Because of my diagnosis,
I think a work environment

331
00:46:04,475 --> 00:46:07,449
where I interact less with others
would be better.

332
00:46:07,778 --> 00:46:10,018
For everyone's benefit.

333
00:46:11,214 --> 00:46:13,989
That's a very responsible attitude.

334
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:26,164
Oh, Nia... meet Dominic,
our new illustrator.

335
00:46:26,264 --> 00:46:30,468
Dominic, this is Nia, she works in text.
You'll be interpreting her words.

336
00:46:30,568 --> 00:46:34,771
- It's very nice to meet you, Nia.
- Welcome to Atmos.

337
00:46:34,871 --> 00:46:37,079
Follow me.

338
00:47:38,268 --> 00:47:43,640
I also design rockets. I could have been
an engineer, but I lacked patience.

339
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:47,711
I think working at Atmos
is a vitally important job.

340
00:47:47,811 --> 00:47:51,720
Science is a process
and often leads to dead-ends.

341
00:47:52,049 --> 00:47:53,784
But here...

342
00:47:53,884 --> 00:47:57,922
we're delivering the answers,
we're educating people.

343
00:47:58,022 --> 00:48:01,759
Knowledge is sacred,
and Atmos is the new scripture.

344
00:48:01,859 --> 00:48:04,828
If you think about it,
we're kind of like preachers.

345
00:48:04,928 --> 00:48:06,531
Where did you study?

346
00:48:06,631 --> 00:48:09,801
I'm self-taught. I've always drawn
pictures ever since I was a child.

347
00:48:09,901 --> 00:48:14,509
One of my guardians, Barnabas,
nicknamed me Little Da Vinci.

348
00:48:15,439 --> 00:48:18,308
Did you hear? Zoe was inseminated.

349
00:48:18,408 --> 00:48:20,979
It means she's clean.
She didn't catch the bug from Silas.

350
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:24,762
- That means we're probably clean, too.
- I'm definitely clean.

351
00:48:24,862 --> 00:48:27,422
I donated blood last week.

352
00:49:12,662 --> 00:49:14,536
Silas?

353
00:49:17,334 --> 00:49:19,174
Jonas?

354
00:49:25,942 --> 00:49:28,078
You okay?

355
00:49:28,178 --> 00:49:29,747
Okay.

356
00:49:30,597 --> 00:49:32,571
Do you want to take a walk?

357
00:49:39,656 --> 00:49:41,929
I miss her.

358
00:49:43,092 --> 00:49:47,570
I don't know, it felt so good
to be around her that...

359
00:49:48,598 --> 00:49:52,307
we were nearly tripping up
and I couldn't see...

360
00:49:53,003 --> 00:49:55,605
couldn't see anything bad
happening to her.

361
00:49:55,705 --> 00:49:58,141
You two were in love with each other.

362
00:49:58,241 --> 00:50:01,479
That's very clear.
You were right to end it though.

363
00:50:01,579 --> 00:50:04,115
I think dealing with this disease
on your own is hard enough,

364
00:50:04,215 --> 00:50:07,246
coupling would just make it unbearable.

365
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:15,459
You know...

366
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:17,766
about a year ago...

367
00:50:18,562 --> 00:50:21,803
I also made a connection with a woman.

368
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:27,376
Though, it didn't end well.

369
00:50:33,076 --> 00:50:35,350
So sorry.

370
00:50:38,782 --> 00:50:42,457
Your friend, what stage is she?

371
00:50:43,086 --> 00:50:46,591
She's self-diagnosed.
She's fighting the bug without drugs.

372
00:50:46,691 --> 00:50:49,163
She's a "hider."

373
00:50:52,262 --> 00:50:56,833
Not many people can do that successfully.
I think hiders are...

374
00:50:56,933 --> 00:50:58,836
I think they are wired differently.

375
00:50:58,936 --> 00:51:02,239
You know we have one in our group.
Bess. She's a...

376
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:05,542
she's a doctor at the den, of all places.

377
00:51:05,642 --> 00:51:08,813
Listen, I'm part of a group.
A support group.

378
00:51:08,913 --> 00:51:11,315
With Bess and others from my work.

379
00:51:11,415 --> 00:51:14,718
To talk openly about how we feel.

380
00:51:14,818 --> 00:51:17,587
If you're interested I'll vouch for you.

381
00:51:17,687 --> 00:51:19,961
It might help.

382
00:51:21,424 --> 00:51:23,966
I'd be willing to try.

383
00:51:25,895 --> 00:51:27,736
Great.

384
00:51:32,068 --> 00:51:35,839
Nia, it's me again. Until you give me
some text to work with, I am idle,

385
00:51:35,939 --> 00:51:39,147
and that doesn't seem
like a very good use of my time.

386
00:51:40,944 --> 00:51:42,246
I'm almost finished, Dominic.

387
00:51:42,346 --> 00:51:44,715
All the other illustrators
received their pieces hours ago...

388
00:51:44,815 --> 00:51:46,972
I'm almost finished, Dominic.

389
00:51:51,788 --> 00:51:54,196
But I appreciate your patience.

390
00:51:55,292 --> 00:51:57,499
Of course.

391
00:52:52,816 --> 00:52:55,485
Silas, you made it.

392
00:52:55,585 --> 00:52:57,321
This is great. I'm glad you're here.

393
00:52:57,421 --> 00:53:00,624
Everybody, this is Silas.
The one I was telling you about.

394
00:53:00,724 --> 00:53:03,594
Silas, this is Bess. Peter and Thomas.

395
00:53:03,694 --> 00:53:05,929
Gilead, Max and Alice.

396
00:53:06,029 --> 00:53:08,338
Come take a seat.

397
00:53:10,538 --> 00:53:12,836
...and then after lunch
he just kept staring at me,

398
00:53:12,936 --> 00:53:16,189
like he could tell
I wasn't taking my meds.

399
00:53:16,289 --> 00:53:18,558
And I wanted to say something to him.

400
00:53:18,658 --> 00:53:22,512
But then I thought,
what if I'm just imagining it?

401
00:53:22,612 --> 00:53:25,982
So I turned and walked away.

402
00:53:26,082 --> 00:53:27,852
And all I could think is that he knows.

403
00:53:27,952 --> 00:53:30,921
He's going to report me
and I'm going to get caught.

404
00:53:31,021 --> 00:53:34,072
And I can't stop thinking that.
All the time...

405
00:53:34,172 --> 00:53:36,611
It's natural.
It's happened to every one of us.

406
00:53:36,711 --> 00:53:40,564
Yes, but all I could think is that I am
going to the den. I'm going to the den.

407
00:53:40,664 --> 00:53:44,068
It's over. And they're...

408
00:53:47,754 --> 00:53:49,828
What happens in the den?

409
00:53:58,014 --> 00:54:00,518
Half the people who are
brought in commit suicide.

410
00:54:00,618 --> 00:54:04,355
The staff encourages it
and stand by while it happens.

411
00:54:04,455 --> 00:54:06,157
And that's the preferable option anyway.

412
00:54:06,257 --> 00:54:09,093
Compared to electro restraints
and all the other methods of treatment.

413
00:54:09,193 --> 00:54:12,367
But there is value in living.

414
00:54:14,981 --> 00:54:17,918
Being a hider reminds you of that.

415
00:54:18,018 --> 00:54:20,937
I still don't know how you do it.

416
00:54:21,037 --> 00:54:24,212
Working for health and safety
is hard enough.

417
00:54:25,875 --> 00:54:29,947
Yes, it's difficult to see things
and not be moved.

418
00:54:30,047 --> 00:54:33,883
But that's what being
a hider is all about.

419
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:36,603
So you do small things to help.

420
00:54:36,703 --> 00:54:39,406
Just looking someone in the eyes,

421
00:54:39,506 --> 00:54:44,115
can make them feel they're not alone.
Give them hope.

422
00:54:45,462 --> 00:54:49,599
But under no circumstances
do you interfere.

423
00:54:49,699 --> 00:54:55,010
You have to tell yourself, do not risk
your job, do not risk your life.

424
00:54:58,341 --> 00:55:02,150
But why stay in a position
where you feel so much risk?

425
00:55:02,612 --> 00:55:07,422
- You could ask to be reassigned.
- I'd rather be with people who feel.

426
00:55:08,218 --> 00:55:10,754
Who feel intensely.

427
00:55:11,254 --> 00:55:15,593
It reminds me of who I am
and why I choose to keep on living.

428
00:55:15,693 --> 00:55:19,196
Everybody says it's not contagious.

429
00:55:19,596 --> 00:55:23,566
But after all these years
as awful as it is,

430
00:55:23,666 --> 00:55:26,936
everyday I feel a stronger...

431
00:55:27,036 --> 00:55:30,245
affinity with other people.

432
00:55:32,275 --> 00:55:34,844
See I don't believe all the research.

433
00:55:34,944 --> 00:55:37,347
Feelings engender feelings.

434
00:55:37,447 --> 00:55:40,751
S.O.S. isn't even a disease,
that's what they say but...

435
00:55:40,851 --> 00:55:44,755
switched off is something they do
to us between conception and birth.

436
00:55:44,855 --> 00:55:46,891
S.O.S. is who we really are and...

437
00:55:46,991 --> 00:55:50,394
the inhibitors are just
another attempt to squash that.

438
00:55:50,494 --> 00:55:53,763
- I don't know.
- It's so hard.

439
00:55:53,863 --> 00:55:56,199
It's lonely.

440
00:55:56,499 --> 00:56:00,370
At least with the inhibitors
I can get by but now...

441
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:03,206
I would rather feel nothing.

442
00:56:03,506 --> 00:56:06,615
Nothing is better than this.

443
00:57:46,042 --> 00:57:48,667
It's okay. It's okay.

444
00:59:15,565 --> 00:59:19,870
I could never have imagined
what love felt like. It's strange...

445
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:23,006
like a little tornado going around and...

446
00:59:23,106 --> 00:59:24,831
Yeah.

447
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:30,736
That's why I was so scared of it at first.

448
00:59:35,852 --> 00:59:39,022
It's about giving,
I want you to take everything,

449
00:59:39,122 --> 00:59:42,860
I don't even know what it is,
I just want you to take it from me.

450
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,794
I just want to...

451
00:59:44,894 --> 00:59:47,102
I want to run.

452
00:59:49,766 --> 00:59:52,201
I want to run... both of us...

453
00:59:52,301 --> 00:59:55,734
as fast as we can, outside, just take off.

454
00:59:59,175 --> 01:00:01,544
It's so weird, I'm like...

455
01:00:01,644 --> 01:00:04,319
I keep on thinking about...

456
01:00:05,181 --> 01:00:08,452
Ever since we were kids
it's been drilled into us that...

457
01:00:08,552 --> 01:00:11,388
our purpose is to explore
the universe, you know.

458
01:00:11,488 --> 01:00:14,290
Outer space is where we'll find...

459
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:18,600
the answers to why we're here and...

460
01:00:19,128 --> 01:00:21,664
where we come from.

461
01:00:21,764 --> 01:00:24,033
It's like everyone's...

462
01:00:24,133 --> 01:00:29,073
searching for these answers 800
million miles away and the truth is...

463
01:00:29,173 --> 01:00:31,413
the answers are right in front of us.

464
01:00:33,042 --> 01:00:35,017
I know why I'm here.

465
01:00:36,779 --> 01:00:38,820
Me too.

466
01:00:40,683 --> 01:00:42,685
What are we going to do now?

467
01:00:42,785 --> 01:00:47,758
We just spend as much time
here together as we can.

468
01:00:47,858 --> 01:00:51,935
Go to work, act normal, but then...

469
01:00:53,028 --> 01:00:55,236
at night...

470
01:00:55,898 --> 01:00:57,490
we're together.

471
01:00:59,135 --> 01:01:00,976
Okay.

472
01:01:22,992 --> 01:01:25,697
What did you look like
when you were little?

473
01:01:27,663 --> 01:01:30,572
Have you always had these freckles?

474
01:01:32,568 --> 01:01:34,775
I don't know.

475
01:01:35,004 --> 01:01:37,245
I think so.

476
01:01:38,007 --> 01:01:40,977
- Did you grow early?
- Did I grow early?

477
01:01:41,077 --> 01:01:43,285
Yeah, I was tall until I wasn't.

478
01:01:46,349 --> 01:01:48,624
I was a little round kid.

479
01:01:55,992 --> 01:01:58,561
What was your favorite subject?

480
01:01:58,661 --> 01:02:01,395
I liked history. How about you?

481
01:02:02,325 --> 01:02:04,268
I always really loved to write.

482
01:02:04,368 --> 01:02:08,113
- What did you write when you were a kid?
- I always liked to write poetry.

483
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:14,148
I liked the school trips as well.

484
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:18,945
When we got to go...
to the great war museum...

485
01:02:19,415 --> 01:02:23,691
to see how the bombs dropped
and wiped out the cities and stuff.

486
01:02:25,254 --> 01:02:27,724
I see a future outside of this room.

487
01:02:27,824 --> 01:02:31,662
Some place out there in the vastness
of everything we know.

488
01:02:32,062 --> 01:02:34,580
In all those millions of miles.

489
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:38,318
Dominic FYI. The article's finished.

490
01:02:38,868 --> 01:02:41,305
You gave it to me already.
I'm working on it right now.

491
01:02:41,405 --> 01:02:46,147
No, the one after this. On the extraction
of superfluids from neutron stars.

492
01:02:47,843 --> 01:02:49,616
No pressure.

493
01:02:50,279 --> 01:02:53,749
I wish I could explain this
to everyone else.

494
01:02:53,849 --> 01:02:57,421
I'm sick of being...
scared of getting caught.

495
01:02:57,521 --> 01:03:03,165
I want people to know
and not think we're sick.

496
01:03:35,991 --> 01:03:40,664
<i>The significant breakthrough came
with the isolation of the bulbar cell line,</i>

497
01:03:40,764 --> 01:03:43,700
<i>allowing an effective
genetic re-silencing,</i>

498
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,803
<i>without triggering
the systematic organ malfunction</i>

499
01:03:46,903 --> 01:03:49,106
<i>that had marked earlier attempts.</i>

500
01:03:49,206 --> 01:03:52,776
<i>To be clear, this is not
another Kappa Rho inhibitor.</i>

501
01:03:52,876 --> 01:03:57,047
<i>It's a cure that restores the health
and systematic order to the individual.</i>

502
01:03:57,147 --> 01:04:00,262
<i>With the Ashby Eni cure,
it is only a matter of time</i>

503
01:04:00,362 --> 01:04:04,988
<i>before all current S.O.S. cases are
treated, and future cases prevented.</i>

504
01:04:05,088 --> 01:04:07,924
<i>The ENI cure is injected
directly into the neck,</i>

505
01:04:08,024 --> 01:04:12,362
<i>leaving a small coin-like scar,
a quick and simple procedure.</i>

506
01:04:12,462 --> 01:04:16,800
<i>Once administered, the drug requires
a six hour absorption period,</i>

507
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:19,636
<i>before the disease
is completely neutralized.</i>

508
01:04:19,736 --> 01:04:22,272
<i>After which point, regardless of stage,</i>

509
01:04:22,372 --> 01:04:25,142
<i>the patient is restored to normal health.</i>

510
01:04:25,242 --> 01:04:27,844
<i>Mass production of the drug
is already underway.</i>

511
01:04:27,944 --> 01:04:31,682
<i>And shipments are being made available
to public clinics immediately.</i>

512
01:04:31,782 --> 01:04:35,652
<i>Individuals diagnosed with S.O.S.
need not suffer another day.</i>

513
01:04:35,752 --> 01:04:39,840
<i>Contact your doctor immediately
to receive the Ashby ENI cure...</i>

514
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:42,875
<i>and rejoin the ranks of equals...</i>

515
01:05:07,083 --> 01:05:09,865
We're gonna remember this feeling.

516
01:05:13,756 --> 01:05:17,278
We're gonna live every day remembering
and we're not gonna feel it.

517
01:05:24,567 --> 01:05:27,043
We're not even gonna exist anymore.

518
01:05:41,183 --> 01:05:43,554
It's not over.

519
01:05:45,321 --> 01:05:47,628
We're not doing that.

520
01:05:52,695 --> 01:05:55,645
- So you don't want the cure.
- No.

521
01:05:56,131 --> 01:05:58,133
Do you?

522
01:05:58,233 --> 01:06:00,108
No.

523
01:06:19,071 --> 01:06:21,312
This is Nia.

524
01:06:23,525 --> 01:06:26,013
We want to go to the Peninsula.

525
01:06:28,097 --> 01:06:32,840
At my old post,
I took part in an air patrol.

526
01:06:33,269 --> 01:06:35,906
We wouldn't fly directly
over the Peninsula, but...

527
01:06:36,006 --> 01:06:39,443
I could see it from a distance.
It's totally overgrown.

528
01:06:39,543 --> 01:06:44,114
If anyone actually lives there
it's in a completely primitive state.

529
01:06:44,214 --> 01:06:47,784
- How do we get there?
- You're seriously considering this?

530
01:06:47,884 --> 01:06:51,388
- We've already decided.
- You know you'll be on your own out there.

531
01:06:51,488 --> 01:06:54,157
There will be no one to look after you.

532
01:06:54,557 --> 01:06:56,893
Whatever we go through
it will be together.

533
01:06:56,993 --> 01:07:00,764
I know how you're feeling,
but you're not thinking of all the risks.

534
01:07:00,864 --> 01:07:05,072
If we stay here we'll be found out.
We'll get the cure.

535
01:07:08,437 --> 01:07:11,223
You know, it's many years ago...

536
01:07:11,323 --> 01:07:15,594
I was not much older than you are now
when I got the bug,

537
01:07:15,694 --> 01:07:19,933
no one even knew
what S.O.S. was back then.

538
01:07:20,033 --> 01:07:24,725
People were getting it, and most
of them would commit suicide.

539
01:07:25,588 --> 01:07:28,991
There was a young man in my living block,

540
01:07:29,091 --> 01:07:32,995
I could tell he was a hider, just like me,

541
01:07:33,095 --> 01:07:36,570
but no one dared mention it back then.

542
01:07:37,299 --> 01:07:38,841
One night...

543
01:07:38,941 --> 01:07:42,205
he knocked on my door
and told me that he and two others...

544
01:07:42,305 --> 01:07:44,908
were going to the Peninsula
and he wanted me to go with him.

545
01:07:45,008 --> 01:07:48,082
Of course, there was no way I was going.

546
01:07:48,744 --> 01:07:51,214
I knew they were headed for their deaths.

547
01:07:51,314 --> 01:07:52,887
Bess.

548
01:07:56,202 --> 01:08:00,778
A few months after he left
were the loneliest I ever felt.

549
01:08:02,091 --> 01:08:05,166
We'd only spoken that one time.

550
01:08:06,695 --> 01:08:10,099
More than all the suicides I've seen.

551
01:08:10,199 --> 01:08:12,903
It was his death that was the most...

552
01:08:13,003 --> 01:08:15,571
unnecessarily wasteful.

553
01:08:15,671 --> 01:08:18,107
Such a waste.

554
01:08:18,207 --> 01:08:20,796
That was a new feeling for me.

555
01:08:22,244 --> 01:08:24,918
But you don't know that he died.

556
01:08:26,382 --> 01:08:28,856
What if he didn't?

557
01:08:41,263 --> 01:08:45,635
I can talk to my old colleague. He was
the pilot who took us on the air patrol.

558
01:08:45,735 --> 01:08:50,444
If they get caught, the whole plan could
be traced back to you or to the group.

559
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:54,586
You said interfering was too risky.

560
01:08:55,277 --> 01:08:59,995
If you make this decision
you know... there is no turning back.

561
01:09:00,095 --> 01:09:02,934
If you do manage to get out...

562
01:09:03,587 --> 01:09:05,961
you can never return.

563
01:09:07,156 --> 01:09:09,363
Of course.

564
01:09:22,371 --> 01:09:26,380
When you get to the border
ask for Oliver, he will fly you.

565
01:09:28,277 --> 01:09:30,613
What if he gets caught?

566
01:09:30,813 --> 01:09:32,231
He won't.

567
01:09:34,683 --> 01:09:36,924
Good luck.

568
01:09:40,055 --> 01:09:41,490
Thank you.

569
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:52,789
Welling is the closest station
to the border.

570
01:09:52,889 --> 01:09:55,972
Trains don't go there until the weekend.
I checked the schedule.

571
01:09:56,072 --> 01:09:58,478
We could leave on Saturday.

572
01:09:59,942 --> 01:10:01,783
Three days.

573
01:10:06,582 --> 01:10:09,423
- You're shaking.
- So are you.

574
01:10:12,421 --> 01:10:15,820
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Are you?

575
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:01,342
I got a conception summons.

576
01:11:03,972 --> 01:11:05,005
We're leaving in two days.

577
01:11:05,105 --> 01:11:08,061
By the time they come looking
for you we'll be gone. Ignore it.

578
01:11:08,161 --> 01:11:09,980
My tag is blocked,
I'm not gonna get on the train.

579
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,281
I won't make it through
any of the check points.

580
01:11:12,381 --> 01:11:15,088
Look, it's just a summons, right?

581
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:18,588
It's not like they're going
to inseminate you...

582
01:11:18,688 --> 01:11:22,229
They'll check my blood.
They'll see I have the disease instantly.

583
01:11:22,424 --> 01:11:24,794
Yeah, but they can't force you
to get the cure.

584
01:11:24,894 --> 01:11:27,130
I've been diagnosed,
no one's forcing me to get it, are they?

585
01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:29,598
Besides, the clinics
are overwhelmed right now.

586
01:11:29,698 --> 01:11:33,270
All that's going to happen is, they'll
tell you you've tested positive for S.O.S.,

587
01:11:33,370 --> 01:11:37,866
and that you should see your doctor
immediately, that's it. Then get out of there.

588
01:11:39,308 --> 01:11:41,376
Nothing's changed.

589
01:11:41,476 --> 01:11:45,014
We're leaving Saturday, 10 o'clock train.
You've missed the whole morning of work.

590
01:11:45,114 --> 01:11:47,550
You should get over there right away.
I'll come after my shift.

591
01:11:47,650 --> 01:11:49,652
Meet me behind the clinic.

592
01:11:49,752 --> 01:11:51,342
Okay.

593
01:12:02,864 --> 01:12:05,572
I received a summons.

594
01:12:23,352 --> 01:12:25,488
- Hello, Nia.
- Hello, doctor.

595
01:12:25,588 --> 01:12:28,095
Lie back for me, please.

596
01:12:31,059 --> 01:12:33,096
I'm going to take a sample
of your blood, okay?

597
01:12:33,196 --> 01:12:35,069
Okay.

598
01:12:50,646 --> 01:12:53,049
I have the bug, don't I?

599
01:12:53,799 --> 01:12:56,194
Nia, you're pregnant.

600
01:15:40,349 --> 01:15:42,151
- What is it?
- She's pregnant.

601
01:15:42,251 --> 01:15:46,522
She got called for conception duty and they
found out. They're taking her to the den.

602
01:15:46,622 --> 01:15:48,891
- You need to calm down.
- I'm calm, I'm calm, it's fine.

603
01:15:48,991 --> 01:15:51,294
- When did they take her?
- About an hour ago or something.

604
01:15:51,394 --> 01:15:53,994
- Well, listen, I will contact Bess...
- No, no. No. Not Bess.

605
01:15:54,094 --> 01:15:57,700
- She won't help us. Ask someone else.
- There is no one else. Bess is our only hope.

606
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,336
Listen, you can't be seen
around here like this.

607
01:16:00,436 --> 01:16:02,774
I'm fine, but let me come with you.
Let me help her...

608
01:16:02,874 --> 01:16:05,744
- Go home, I'll contact you. Wait there.
- I can talk to them. Let me go with you.

609
01:16:05,844 --> 01:16:08,338
Don't attempt to see Nia.

610
01:16:08,438 --> 01:16:10,847
Silas, go home. Trust me.

611
01:16:10,947 --> 01:16:13,783
- What are they gonna do to her?
- Just calm down.

612
01:16:13,883 --> 01:16:17,386
You need to stay calm,
or they'll give you the cure.

613
01:16:17,486 --> 01:16:21,428
Give me a couple hours.
Go home and wait there.

614
01:18:28,583 --> 01:18:31,721
- Jonas?
- Get dressed as fast as you can.

615
01:18:31,821 --> 01:18:34,056
And listen to me carefully,

616
01:18:34,156 --> 01:18:37,481
last week, a woman
was brought in called Eva.

617
01:18:37,581 --> 01:18:42,198
She was stage three. Last night she
knotted a garbage bag over her head,

618
01:18:42,298 --> 01:18:44,466
suffocated, she's dead.

619
01:18:44,566 --> 01:18:47,870
Now you... are going
to switch places with her.

620
01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:51,140
Eva didn't kill herself
last night, you did.

621
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:53,409
You are Eva, she was you.

622
01:18:53,509 --> 01:18:55,944
- You're gonna walk out of here.
- Just...

623
01:18:56,044 --> 01:18:59,714
Hold out your arm. Your left arm please.

624
01:18:59,814 --> 01:19:01,622
Okay.

625
01:19:02,784 --> 01:19:04,971
All right.

626
01:19:06,271 --> 01:19:08,745
You are Eva.

627
01:19:09,791 --> 01:19:12,800
- Got it?
- Ready?

628
01:19:26,541 --> 01:19:30,174
I told Silas to wait at his apartment.
You'll find him there.

629
01:21:39,374 --> 01:21:43,212
<i>The following message is an update
on the security breach at the den.</i>

630
01:21:43,312 --> 01:21:46,649
<i>The Collective wishes to congratulate
health and safety official,</i>

631
01:21:46,749 --> 01:21:50,192
<i>I.D.: 22564943</i>

632
01:21:50,292 --> 01:21:55,124
<i>who alerted authorities to three individuals
operating against protocol at the den.</i>

633
01:21:55,224 --> 01:21:57,827
<i>Two of the three were health
and safety officials,</i>

634
01:21:57,927 --> 01:22:00,329
<i>and the third was a physician at the den.</i>

635
01:22:00,429 --> 01:22:03,900
<i>All are currently safe
and receiving the Ashby ENI cure.</i>

636
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,970
<i>So that they may return to work as
productive equals in the Collective.</i>

637
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:11,507
<i>The ENI cure will now be required
for those diagnosed with,</i>

638
01:22:11,607 --> 01:22:13,342
<i>or suffering from S.O.S.</i>

639
01:22:13,442 --> 01:22:16,645
<i>And mandatory S.O.S. testing
will begin immediately,</i>

640
01:22:16,745 --> 01:22:21,283
<i>for all health and safety officials
as well as medical professionals.</i>

641
01:22:21,983 --> 01:22:23,792
<i>Welcome...</i>

642
01:22:27,989 --> 01:22:32,027
Her name is Nia. Her ID tag is 34729647.

643
01:22:32,127 --> 01:22:34,701
She writes text for Atmos.

644
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:38,005
- You said her name was Nia?
- Yes.

645
01:22:40,401 --> 01:22:42,570
Was she brought here yesterday evening?

646
01:22:42,670 --> 01:22:45,745
- Lives at 6L 415?
- That's right.

647
01:22:46,674 --> 01:22:49,015
She died last night.

648
01:22:49,477 --> 01:22:53,186
According to the doctor's notes,
the cause of death was asphyxiation.

649
01:22:55,450 --> 01:22:58,558
Could you... could you check that again?

650
01:23:03,057 --> 01:23:05,098
Yes, that's her.

651
01:23:14,302 --> 01:23:16,143
Sir?

652
01:23:17,405 --> 01:23:19,679
Are you okay?

653
01:23:21,843 --> 01:23:24,384
Do you need some help?

654
01:26:49,984 --> 01:26:52,358
Where have you been?

655
01:26:53,354 --> 01:26:55,229
Hey.

656
01:27:02,163 --> 01:27:04,434
You okay?

657
01:27:13,491 --> 01:27:15,265
Why?

658
01:27:17,478 --> 01:27:20,453
I thought... I thought you were gone.

659
01:27:28,890 --> 01:27:31,719
How long do you have?

660
01:27:31,859 --> 01:27:34,334
Maybe five hours.

661
01:27:44,973 --> 01:27:46,813
Silas.

662
01:27:52,113 --> 01:27:53,920
Hey.

663
01:27:56,250 --> 01:27:58,524
Fight it.

664
01:28:00,154 --> 01:28:04,159
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.
Fight it. Okay?

665
01:28:04,859 --> 01:28:07,066
I'm still pregnant.

666
01:28:13,701 --> 01:28:17,370
We're going to get
on the train tomorrow. Okay?

667
01:28:21,309 --> 01:28:23,550
I love you.

668
01:28:25,279 --> 01:28:29,756
I love you, I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you.

669
01:28:43,865 --> 01:28:47,068
You have to fight it. Just fight it, okay?

670
01:28:47,668 --> 01:28:50,376
I can already tell it's in me.

671
01:28:53,441 --> 01:28:56,978
Just remember... okay?

672
01:28:57,578 --> 01:28:59,452
How?

673
01:29:03,317 --> 01:29:05,658
Remember this feeling.

674
01:29:07,989 --> 01:29:10,863
Just remember what this feels like.

675
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:16,478
Yeah, just promise me, no matter...

676
01:29:16,578 --> 01:29:20,135
what happens you keep loving me,
no matter what I say,

677
01:29:20,235 --> 01:29:25,040
what I feel or don't feel, I'm still...
I'm still in here trying. Okay?

678
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:29,044
I'm still in here.
Just don't give up on me.

679
01:29:29,144 --> 01:29:32,732
- Please, don't give up on me.
- I promise.

680
01:29:33,361 --> 01:29:36,141
I promise that I won't...

681
01:30:25,866 --> 01:30:27,574
Silas?

682
01:30:31,739 --> 01:30:33,913
Good morning.

683
01:30:41,482 --> 01:30:43,723
Do you still love me?

684
01:30:50,124 --> 01:30:52,694
I remember I loved you.

685
01:30:53,394 --> 01:30:55,235
But...

686
01:30:57,098 --> 01:30:59,472
I don't feel it anymore.

687
01:31:05,973 --> 01:31:08,347
Do you still want to go?

688
01:31:09,777 --> 01:31:12,084
We made a plan.

689
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:20,894
Right.

690
01:32:02,129 --> 01:32:07,369
<i>This is a non-local transport serving
outlying regions with three stops.</i>

691
01:32:07,469 --> 01:32:11,812
<i>The final destination port will be
Welling at the outer Peninsula.</i>

692
01:32:11,912 --> 01:32:14,617
<i>This transport is for...</i>
