1
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,285
Billy, why are we doing this?

2
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,956
Oh, it's just a couple
of questions for posterity's sake.

3
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,459
And you know how much work I got to do.

4
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,212
Just play along, Christina.

5
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,506
Well...
Fine. Go ahead.

6
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,926
Now, are you glad you came to New York?

7
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:52,886
Yes.

8
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:55,556
Do you miss Louisiana?

9
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,725
Parts of it.
Hmm.

10
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,979
What parts?
The good parts.

11
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,985
And what do you like about New York?

12
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,697
I like my work.

13
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,249
I like being a mother.

14
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:32,885
What are you thinking?

15
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,103
That I wish I was as good at love
as I am at working.

16
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,819
I wish I didn't leave people behind
so often.

17
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,916
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
ooh, ah, ah.

18
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:08,544
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
ooh, ah, ah.

19
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:15,761
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
ooh, ah, ah.

20
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:21,850
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
ooh, ah, ah.

21
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:26,855
Darling, I have to be moved from afar.

22
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,815
The truth is the only thing.

23
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:32,653
Worth holding on to anymore.

24
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:35,656
Anymore Untie me.

25
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,950
Let me loose from the cord

26
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,786
I'm so gone, so far

27
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,455
I deserve more.

28
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:45,958
More, I deserve more Yeah

29
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,644
I'm begging you

30
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,962
I beg I'm begging you.

31
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,840
Please come home.

32
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,717
No one even begs anymore.

33
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,889
I'm begging you I beg

34
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,642
I'm begging you,
please come home...

35
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,159
Hello?
Hey.

36
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,453
Uh, Isaac?
You the reporter?

37
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,330
Yeah, Michael Block from The Republic.

38
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,333
Come straight back to the kitchen.
All right.

39
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,178
Hey. Thank you, again.

40
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:41,346
Yeah, sit down.

41
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,265
All right.
Mmm-hmm.

42
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,144
This will likely be
the best boiled crab you ever eaten.

43
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,771
Oh, no, I'm all right.
I ate on the plane.

44
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:53,317
I just offered you crab.
That's not the correct response.

45
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,946
Hey, um, do you mind if I record?

46
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,740
Your story's about BP?

47
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:00,908
Pointe à la Hache.

48
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:05,078
Uh, Katrina, the oil spill,
how it kind of affected things there.

49
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,665
So, did you always fish?

50
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:13,420
Well, I'm third generation,
but I was in the military.

51
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:17,381
Before that, I was working
on an oil refinery for Gulf Oil.

52
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,570
What was it like working for Gulf Oil?

53
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,887
They fired me.
Why?

54
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,014
I refused to pump dirty water
into the river.

55
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,311
It took us generations to go
from sharecropping to independent.

56
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,563
They destroyed us with the oil spill.

57
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:36,777
This was my wife.

58
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,321
Whoa.

59
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,074
You married?

60
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,326
Uh, I... just got out of something.

61
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,995
She, um...
She called while I was flying, man.

62
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:50,207
She... She told me,
"Don't even bother stopping by."

63
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,376
Well...

64
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,169
She probably doesn't mean that.

65
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,004
Ah, she's probably right.

66
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,006
Who's this?

67
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,800
Christina Eames.

68
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:02,344
She took these other photos.

69
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,513
That was me in '84.

70
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,808
She's great.
Yeah.

71
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,142
She from here?
Yeah.

72
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,895
She moved to New York.
She's a photographer.

73
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:15,107
Hmm. That was...
Does she have more like this?

74
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,651
Um, I'm sure she does.

75
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:22,573
We lost contact, uh,
after she took off, or...

76
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,950
I let her leave.

77
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,370
Thirty years later,
still trying to figure that out.

78
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,331
Why don't you just look her up?

79
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:33,000
Too much time done passed.

80
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,003
Hmm.
I don't recommend getting older.

81
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:40,591
Less people to talk to,
more time to go over every regret.

82
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:28,013
My Mae, There are two letters.

83
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:32,059
Please read yours first before
sharing the second with your father.

84
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:33,769
Love, Mom.

85
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,393
My Mae,

86
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:18,313
Cancer is a creature
lurching through my body.

87
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,942
I waited far too long
to face it squarely.

88
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,362
I need to write my way
out of the mess I've made.

89
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,657
I hope you won't judge me too harshly.

90
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,787
Sometimes the heart
can be so full of love,

91
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:38,208
it's like a weight on your chest
making it impossible to move.

92
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,211
That's how I felt when I was with him.

93
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,742
I don't want to write this down

94
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,536
I want to tell you
how I feel right now.

95
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:18,332
I don't want to take no time
to write this down

96
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,834
I want to tell you
how I feel right now.

97
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,419
Hey...

98
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:24,087
What's up? Get those photos I sent you?

99
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,756
Yeah, I got 'em.
All right.

100
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:30,260
For you or me, life is not promised.

101
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:33,680
Tomorrow may never appear.

102
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,767
You better hold this very moment.

103
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,894
Very close to you Right now.

104
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,562
Very close to you, so close to you...

105
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:45,317
Oh. How was Louisiana?
Good.

106
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,277
And how is the girl?

107
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,496
Huh. It didn't work out.
Don't... No.

108
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:01,250
Shine your light
for the world to see...

109
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,419
Oh, coffee for me. Look at you sucking up.

110
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:07,714
Hey, have you ever noticed
how ugly this place actually is?

111
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:08,799
Mmm-mmm.

112
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,094
It's bleak and confining
and it's claustrophobic.

113
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,531
It don't look that bad to me.

114
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,241
Actually, it's fine,
it's a really nice building,

115
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:18,517
but look, they won't give me
anything to write.

116
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,601
Yeah.

117
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:21,895
Why don't you do me a favor

118
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:24,690
and, uh, look up this photographer
named Christina Eames.

119
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,151
Cool?
Oh, all right.

120
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,570
Yeah.
Yeah.

121
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:39,872
Mae?

122
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,707
Yeah.
Hey.

123
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,113
Michael Block from The Republic.

124
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:45,794
Hey.

125
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,385
Uh, after you called,

126
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:56,096
I pulled all my mother's photos
from Pointe à la Hache.

127
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,181
Oh, thanks.

128
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,039
Yeah, since she died,
I've been going through all her things.

129
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,979
We weren't expecting it.
She didn't tell anyone she was sick.

130
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:05,939
Oh, I'm sorry.

131
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,278
I saw some of Christina's work
in New Orleans.

132
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,239
Um, the guy I was profiling
showed me a picture of her.

133
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:18,035
She hated when people took photos of her.
Oh.

134
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:30,797
He said the relationship ended
after she left Louisiana.

135
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,468
Well, she wasn't good at staying anywhere.

136
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:38,055
Or with anyone. Just ask my father.
Mmm.

137
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,808
Um, maybe we shouldn't be good
at staying places.

138
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,520
That sounds very mobile.

139
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,980
Well, maybe.

140
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:50,609
So I take it you're not walking down
any aisles anytime soon?

141
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,320
Nope.
Uh, what about you?

142
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:58,158
Me? I broke up with my last boyfriend
after he proposed.

143
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,035
You got commitment issues?

144
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,329
Wow.

145
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:03,664
Tact.

146
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,166
You from the City?

147
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,418
Yeah.
Oh, okay.

148
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:11,505
And how long have you been
at Queens Museum?

149
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,508
I've been assistant curator for two years.

150
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,719
What about you?
How long have you been at The Republic?

151
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:21,431
Uh, too long, probably.
Like, four years.

152
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:30,816
Oh, wait a minute.
This is, uh, Isaac.

153
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:32,442
You know him?

154
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:36,405
I don't know. I...

155
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:41,159
I went to Louisiana once
as a child, but...

156
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:43,787
Yeah.

157
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,041
You know, uh...

158
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,463
Uh, maybe we should talk more.

159
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:56,008
You know, I mean...
maybe you could talk,

160
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:59,928
tell me more about Christina
and, uh, Pointe à la Hache.

161
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,640
Uh, I could call you.

162
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,035
On your one day off,
why would you choose to come back here?

163
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:25,454
This was supposed to be a date.

164
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,334
We should go to New Orleans this weekend.

165
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:32,169
Why?

166
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,921
You question anything that's fun.

167
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,381
What's so fun about New Orleans?

168
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:40,636
The people are different.
And we could dance.

169
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:46,183
Until I had them memorized...

170
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:50,312
We could dance right here.

171
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:53,023
If you don't want to go,
I'll just go with Denise and Peter.

172
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,900
You can stay here with Ashley Prentiss.

173
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,485
Why are you bringing up Ashley?

174
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,196
Because she is always
hanging around the harbor for no reason,

175
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,439
trying to get your attention.

176
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:02,032
That's not true.

177
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,618
I'm sure she'd be happy to stay home.

178
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:11,041
How much I do.

179
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,294
Do love you...

180
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:16,213
When do you want to go to New Orleans?

181
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,489
Christina.

182
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,245
Why are you slamming my door?
Sorry. I... I didn't mean to.

183
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,586
You look pretty.
Thank you.

184
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,546
You should wear more dresses.

185
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:00,799
Where'd you go?

186
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,468
To the harbor, with Isaac.

187
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:05,262
Isn't that exciting?

188
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,931
I told him
he needs to do better.

189
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,477
He's just like his father.

190
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:14,730
What's wrong with his father?

191
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:15,939
He ain't got nothing.

192
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:20,277
Ain't never gonna have nothing.
How many times I got to tell you that?

193
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,615
We're just friends.

194
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:25,782
"Just friends."

195
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,205
"Just friends."

196
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,166
Aren't you sick of telling that sad story?

197
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,585
What's so sad about being friends?

198
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,796
You being rude to your mama?
No, ma'am.

199
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:41,715
Violet.

200
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,635
I'm not gonna sit out here
by myself all night.

201
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,137
I'm talking to my daughter.

202
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:49,765
Trying to teach her something.

203
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:02,277
Night, baby.

204
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:10,035
You know, it's so hard
being in her apartment right now, Dad.

205
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:13,038
I just remember being there,

206
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:16,208
desperate for her attention,
not getting it.

207
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,672
Thank God that you were there
to make my lunches,

208
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,550
'cause she didn't even notice
when I started smoking weed.

209
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:25,759
Well, I noticed.

210
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:27,553
You did?
Yeah.

211
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,364
You never said anything.
How could I say anything?

212
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:31,306
You were stealing it from your mother.

213
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,688
What if I'm just like her?

214
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:39,273
You're not.

215
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:44,444
Did you read the letter?

216
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,948
I couldn't at first.

217
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,617
I just don't understand why
she couldn't tell me about her life

218
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:52,077
when she was still alive.

219
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,624
Maybe to help you look at her
in another way.

220
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,710
What other way?

221
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:02,880
She wasn't just your mother.

222
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,632
At some point,
you're going to have to forgive her

223
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:08,802
and realize she was just a woman...

224
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,306
with flaws.

225
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,766
A lot of flaws.

226
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,061
Yeah.

227
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,234
I'll get it. I'll get it.

228
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,738
Uncle Michael!
Whoa. Hey.

229
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,103
Look, we'll be just fine.

230
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,746
Yeah, Harlem won't get that much landfall
from the hurricane.

231
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,873
Uh, I did that job interview.

232
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:41,001
Feel like it went well.
I might get it.

233
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,295
Wait, what job?

234
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:46,608
Man, do you listen
to anything we ever talk about?

235
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:49,652
Brother, I'll be trying to, but you know
I got two kids under 10. Come on, now.

236
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,304
Associated Press in London.

237
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:53,805
Oh.

238
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:58,602
You guys know how it is in the City.
It's... I'm feeling caught up, you know?

239
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,688
Sometimes it feels like an accomplishment
just to get to the subway.

240
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:04,274
Plus, Tessa is saying
I'm incapable of any kind of change.

241
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,693
Wait, I'm sorry.
So you want to move because of Tessa?

242
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:07,962
I'm not saying that.

243
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,655
I mean, it kind of sound like that.

244
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:13,158
You hungry?
Why would you ask him that?

245
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:15,093
Don't give him no food.
We don't need to feed him.

246
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,804
Why not?
What you mean, "Why not?"

247
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:19,414
First of all, he a grown man, okay?
And groceries are expensive.

248
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,210
Mike, let me ask you this.
All right? And I'm serious.

249
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:25,712
Are you actually done with Tessa?
Are y'all finished?

250
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:27,476
Oh, we're finished.
Yes, finished-finished.

251
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,383
Good.

252
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:32,719
Kyle.
What? Okay, he was wasting her time.

253
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:35,806
I wasn't wasting her time, was I?

254
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,700
Definitely.
You was definitely wasting her time.

255
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,394
Mom! Dad!
Mom, she took my book!

256
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,563
Sandrine and Sofia.

257
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:44,940
Okay, look, look, how's the story coming?

258
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:48,735
I interviewed this man named Isaac.
He reminds me of Dad.

259
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,196
Uh, he kind of introduced me
to this woman.

260
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:52,948
Kind of?
Yeah.

261
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,909
She, um... She's the daughter
of somebody that he knew.

262
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:58,161
Um, she's a curator at the Queens Museum.

263
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:02,207
Come on, now. Already?
"Already" what, man?

264
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,061
You know what I'm talking about, man.
Already? You, like, like her already?

265
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,312
You trying to date somebody again?

266
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,422
It ain't my fault
I meet people while I work.

267
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,550
And, uh, she's interesting, you know?

268
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:14,178
Oh, so she's interesting.
Yeah.

269
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:17,723
She's got a lot to unpack.
Her mom just died.

270
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,702
So, you're attracted to her
'cause her mama died?

271
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:21,786
Look...
No, I...

272
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,770
Beside the point.
Turn around. Let me talk to you.

273
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:27,232
Why don't you do me a favor, okay?
Take some time to yourself, okay?

274
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:30,652
Figure out what you really want to do
instead of jumping into something again.

275
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:32,821
I don't know. I'd like to see her again.

276
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:35,449
Oh, those girls
are gonna drive me crazy.

277
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:42,932
I didn't know much about photography

278
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,374
when she started taking pictures,

279
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,544
but I knew I liked the way she saw me.

280
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,088
Better than I really was.

281
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:40,556
Hi.
Hi, baby.

282
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:44,643
My ego probably
held me back the most,

283
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,812
why I couldn't make it work
with Christina.

284
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:50,941
I didn't know how to be with a woman
that I had to keep up with.

285
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:56,493
What would you
have done differently?

286
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:01,476
I would've gone after her.

287
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,041
Yo.
What's up, man?

288
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:10,502
Uh, you want to see a movie?

289
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:15,966
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, you.

290
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,092
All right.

291
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:19,678
Let's do it.

292
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:30,772
Thinking ahead of time.

293
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:32,774
Why don't you spend the night?

294
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:34,318
I know you love me.

295
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:38,822
Pick up and roll the dice.

296
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,782
Reading between the lines

297
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:42,284
I know you love me.

298
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:46,705
We can book a flight.

299
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,665
Wake up in paradise.

300
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:50,209
Sun up above us.

301
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,546
Tell me you down to ride.

302
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,632
And you can bet your life.

303
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:58,300
No one above you.

304
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:10,187
Said hold on.

305
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:13,190
Can't stop love...

306
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:16,085
Oh, I see what you're here for.

307
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,194
Nah, you don't see nothing.

308
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:18,278
What you talking about?

309
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,697
What's he doing here?

310
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:22,449
Who?

311
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:24,826
Well, now, hold on. Be right back.

312
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,550
Yeah, I'm gonna go talk to her.

313
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:28,205
I'll meet you upstairs.
All right.

314
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,459
Hey, Mae.

315
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:37,381
Can't stop love.

316
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:42,219
And as long as you're with me

317
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:44,805
I'm definitely...

318
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,395
I was blown away.
Are you being sarcastic?

319
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:22,426
Oh, he's got some follow-up questions.

320
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:26,680
You gonna help me out?

321
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:29,141
Uh, as long as
I don't have to talk to his friend.

322
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,310
So, you're not gonna help me out?

323
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:33,061
Fine.

324
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:37,983
He's cute in an innocent-looking way.
He's kind of dewy. It's refreshing.

325
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:40,027
What is wrong with you?

326
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:43,947
I'd rather be here.

327
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:45,741
Yep.
Oh.

328
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:47,356
I need a drink. Are you coming?

329
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:50,329
Yeah.

330
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:54,249
I didn't know you were coming.

331
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:57,187
Well, you were supposed
to invite me, right?

332
00:22:57,211 --> 00:23:00,047
I'm sorry. Next time.

333
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,381
Uh-huh.

334
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:03,008
How's your article coming?

335
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:06,178
It's all right, you know.
It's kind of moving slowly.

336
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:08,180
How come?
'Cause, uh, well, you know,

337
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:10,474
sometimes good things
take time to develop.

338
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:16,688
How do you know Michael?
We work together.

339
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:19,691
Are you a writer?
Kind of.

340
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:21,109
Why "kind of"?

341
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:22,194
I'm an intern.

342
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:23,862
An intern.

343
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:26,198
Yeah, for now.

344
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:29,868
How old are you?

345
00:23:29,952 --> 00:23:31,537
Why does it matter?

346
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:33,956
Of course it matters legally.

347
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:38,710
I'm a solid 25... in a few months.

348
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:43,006
How old are you?

349
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:46,635
That's none of your business.

350
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,471
What did you think about the movie?

351
00:23:49,555 --> 00:23:52,766
Uh, to be honest,
I was a little distracted.

352
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:55,269
What?
I...

353
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:59,064
So I kept running back in my mind
how you might respond,

354
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:01,358
uh, to me asking you for a drink after.

355
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:03,777
So, that was you asking me?

356
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:05,320
That was elaborate.

357
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:06,798
In my mind, it wasn't that forward.

358
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:09,741
You know what I mean?
It was more... smoother than that.

359
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:11,368
I was supposed to call you, I thought.

360
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:12,953
Yeah, you were supposed to.

361
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:15,497
But you didn't.

362
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:18,292
Well, I can't leave
my girl Rachel behind, so...

363
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,501
Ah.

364
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,712
Oh, it look like Rachel already left.

365
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:24,923
Wow.

366
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:27,843
She's a great friend.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

367
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:30,596
She just disappear when you need her to.
Just... Yeah.

368
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:32,306
I like Kanye.
Yeah?

369
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:35,350
But I'm just concerned
that he don't care about music no more.

370
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:37,311
He does not.
He don't care about us.

371
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:38,395
That's a valid...

372
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,165
He does not care about us anymore.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

373
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:42,232
He cares about interior design.

374
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:43,793
Like, when did he get into that?

375
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:47,070
Like, I'm not trying to buy
Kanye pillows, you know?

376
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:50,365
That would be fine, actually.
That would be. I actually wouldn't mind.

377
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:52,951
Yeah.
Oh, okay, what about Drake?

378
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:56,038
Drake, okay. See, Drake, for me...

379
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:58,540
Drake is like the homey.
Yeah.

380
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,959
Like, you know, he's like a friend
at school who you know.

381
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:03,545
And who knows us. That's what...
Who knows us.

382
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:05,398
That's what I like about him.
He's just in tune.

383
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:06,798
Yeah.
You know, he's, like,

384
00:25:06,882 --> 00:25:10,344
in tune with his feelings
and my feelings, your feelings...

385
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:13,305
Oh, no, you didn't.

386
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:15,057
Sorry. I...
No, you didn't.

387
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,768
I'm just bored by the sentimentality,
all that.

388
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,245
Okay, who do you like?
But, uh...

389
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:21,396
Kendrick.
Oh, no.

390
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,149
Kendrick is my dude, for sure.
I'm so sorry.

391
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:26,113
What? You're telling me
you don't like Kendrick?

392
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:28,195
No, I love...
No, I think he's great. I just...

393
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:30,489
Man, I'm about to flip this table over.

394
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:33,075
No, hear me out. I just...
He makes me feel guilty.

395
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:35,327
Wait, how so?
'Cause I can't...

396
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:38,914
I just feel like, uh, everybody
can't be a change in the world.

397
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:40,433
Everybody can't do that.
Oh, okay.

398
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:42,101
It's too ambitious.
All right. Mmm-hmm.

399
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,836
You know?
You know what?

400
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,855
Now that I think about it,
that is kind of ambitious.

401
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:47,148
Right?
We gonna be all right.

402
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:48,173
It's unfair.
Yeah.

403
00:25:48,257 --> 00:25:49,984
What if I don't want to be all right?
Right.

404
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:52,289
Who knows if we're gonna be all right?
Who knows that?

405
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:54,054
Mmm. Wow.

406
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:58,225
Uh, see,
I'm trying to think of how to...

407
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:00,269
Trying to say something that,
you know...

408
00:26:00,352 --> 00:26:02,020
Uh, just trying to be honest and...

409
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:04,022
Oh, uh, being honest is hard for you?

410
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:05,482
Mmm-mmm.

411
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:09,069
I don't want to say the same thing
that I've said to another woman.

412
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:12,322
You know?
Are there a lot of other women?

413
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:14,074
No, there's a lot of first dates.

414
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:16,785
Yeah, I'm terrible at first dates.
I just...

415
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:17,870
Huh.

416
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:21,999
No, I just don't know whether to be
vulnerable, aloof, funny.

417
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:23,614
Why don't you just be yourself?

418
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,544
I don't know who that is.

419
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:28,064
No, maybe I'm just a collection...
Fair enough.

420
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:30,924
Of wrap dresses
and Kehinde Wiley prints.

421
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:32,050
I don't think so.

422
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:35,554
You ever wonder if we're just...

423
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:39,933
If we're just who we're around
in the moment?

424
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:42,453
I would think that it's important
that we pay attention

425
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:44,188
to who we surround ourselves with, then.

426
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:47,441
True.

427
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:49,484
Yeah.

428
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:52,779
What?

429
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:58,619
I'm wondering if it's not
too early in the night to kiss you.

430
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:31,318
It wasn't too early.

431
00:27:31,777 --> 00:27:33,237
Ah. I see.

432
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:41,578
What was it like?

433
00:27:41,662 --> 00:27:45,207
I don't know.
It felt like we... kissed before.

434
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,418
Yeah, and he called me right after.

435
00:27:48,502 --> 00:27:49,503
To say what?

436
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:52,172
To say that he thought that I was...

437
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:55,968
Thought that you were what?

438
00:27:58,804 --> 00:27:59,805
Special.

439
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:03,600
See? This is why
I can't tell you anything.

440
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:05,269
I knew I shouldn't have told you.

441
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:07,312
Why do you keep doing this?
Doing what?

442
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:09,648
You know. You act like you all in, right?

443
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:12,276
And it don't even last longer
than what, 12 weeks?

444
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,986
All right, well, what about Tessa?

445
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:16,113
What do you mean, "What about Tessa?"
Come on, bro.

446
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,132
That only lasted 'cause
you didn't have to see her every day.

447
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:19,867
Here you go.
Thank you.

448
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:24,371
And by the way, thank you so much
for bailing on me after the movie.

449
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:27,749
Oh, Andy and I were just pawns last night.

450
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:29,835
We ditched you, and then I ditched him.

451
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:31,086
Okay.

452
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,683
Where are you going?

453
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,310
New Orleans.

454
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:47,477
With who?

455
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:49,438
Denise and Peter.

456
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:51,064
Who else?

457
00:28:56,987 --> 00:28:57,988
Who else is going?

458
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:00,115
Isaac.

459
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:02,492
I'm spending the night.

460
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:09,166
What are you planning to do?

461
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:11,084
In New Orleans?
No.

462
00:29:11,168 --> 00:29:14,338
Christina, I'm asking what you planning
to do with your life.

463
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:18,383
You can't just walk around town
taking pictures.

464
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:21,512
How you plan to make money?

465
00:29:22,137 --> 00:29:23,239
Isaac can't take care of you.

466
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:24,407
I don't want him to take care of me.

467
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:26,683
You expect me to keep taking care of you?
No.

468
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:34,107
You're getting too old to live with me.

469
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,240
Are you telling me I need to leave?

470
00:29:44,493 --> 00:29:48,789
I'm saying you'll probably be
more comfortable living alone.

471
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:55,045
You should start looking
for a place that's yours.

472
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:34,001
Come on, Christina.

473
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:37,087
Why are you yelling at me, Denise?

474
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:38,338
'Cause you late.

475
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:40,966
Nice to see you too, Peter.

476
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:44,595
But it's making me weak

477
00:30:44,678 --> 00:30:47,681
I'm not your superwoman.

478
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:53,353
You okay?

479
00:30:53,437 --> 00:30:56,106
I'm not the kind of girl
that you can let down.

480
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,483
And think that everything's okay.

481
00:30:58,567 --> 00:31:02,154
Boy, I am only human...

482
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:11,330
What's up with you, baby?

483
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,593
Ain't nobody Nobody.

484
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:09,012
Loves me better.
Loves me better.

485
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:11,890
Makes me happy, makes me feel...

486
00:32:11,974 --> 00:32:13,058
Marry me.

487
00:32:14,268 --> 00:32:16,854
We've had this conversation.
We're having it again.

488
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:18,480
Here?
Yes.

489
00:32:19,231 --> 00:32:20,732
It's time.

490
00:32:20,816 --> 00:32:22,651
I told you I'm not ready.

491
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:28,198
If you're not gonna marry me,
then I have other demands.

492
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,450
What kind of demands?

493
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:36,331
You've had too much to drink.
I'm just getting started.

494
00:32:36,415 --> 00:32:38,625
I feel like no one could feel...

495
00:32:38,709 --> 00:32:41,879
If this world were mine.

496
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:46,049
I would place at your feet.

497
00:32:47,217 --> 00:32:50,470
All that I own.

498
00:32:50,554 --> 00:32:53,182
You've been so good to me.

499
00:32:55,017 --> 00:33:01,106
If this world were mine.

500
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:06,612
I'd give you the flowers.

501
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:10,282
The birds and the bees.

502
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:14,328
And with your love beside me.

503
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:17,998
That would be all I need.

504
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:22,002
If this world were.

505
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:26,965
Mine

506
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:29,092
I'd give you.

507
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:33,847
Anything.

508
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:39,728
Oh...

509
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:43,774
Every sky would be blue.

510
00:33:43,857 --> 00:33:46,693
As long as you're.

511
00:33:47,027 --> 00:33:49,821
Loving me.

512
00:33:50,822 --> 00:33:53,867
Baby Baby.

513
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:58,205
Ooh, ooh.

514
00:33:58,288 --> 00:34:01,375
It would be yours.

515
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:07,673
If you'll believe.

516
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:16,491
We are in the financial district

517
00:34:16,515 --> 00:34:18,326
and this storm is promising
to be a major event.

518
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,561
This is a transitional storm system,

519
00:34:20,644 --> 00:34:23,647
which means it's guaranteed to be
an absolutely perfect storm.

520
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,608
A tropical depression
that morphs into a severe storm...

521
00:34:26,692 --> 00:34:27,812
Whoa.

522
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:29,695
Yeah. All right.

523
00:34:31,613 --> 00:34:33,240
What?
Nothing.

524
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:36,348
Then why you just look like
you pulled out a win in overtime?

525
00:34:39,245 --> 00:34:40,247
Where you going?

526
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:44,042
Downtown.
Mary's about to make landfall.

527
00:34:44,126 --> 00:34:46,294
Yeah, I don't think it's as bad
as people are saying.

528
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:48,921
You know, it's probably closer
to, like, Hurricane Irene.

529
00:34:49,006 --> 00:34:50,090
Yeah.

530
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:52,466
What?

531
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:55,596
Rachel wants me to come over later.

532
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:57,389
Uh-huh.
Yeah.

533
00:34:57,472 --> 00:34:59,075
See, there's something
about these hurricane,

534
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:01,219
I think they just cause people
to make rash decisions.

535
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:03,770
I hope so.

536
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:07,357
Thirsty.

537
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,527
You are thirsty.
Hey, somebody get him some water.

538
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:13,697
I'm good.

539
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:18,076
I've been here all day.

540
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:20,537
You know they closed the museum,

541
00:35:20,621 --> 00:35:23,582
told us to stay home
until the storm clears tonight.

542
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:26,877
Huh.

543
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:30,756
"Al Green, I'm Still in Love with You."

544
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:33,675
Oh, I love that album.
Yeah.

545
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:39,431
All right, we should bust a move,
so that way we don't end up being stuck.

546
00:35:41,183 --> 00:35:42,518
Trains might stop running.

547
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:44,436
I thought you were brave.

548
00:35:45,646 --> 00:35:48,065
We're in an evacuation zone, so...

549
00:35:48,148 --> 00:35:50,359
Yeah, so why'd you come?

550
00:35:51,235 --> 00:35:53,028
'Cause you're in an evacuation zone.

551
00:35:55,572 --> 00:35:57,050
I'm gonna grab some things.

552
00:35:57,074 --> 00:35:58,534
Let's go.

553
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:04,957
What, you, um,
you need a little help with that?

554
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,458
Getting it into your spot?

555
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:08,794
Oh, so you're actually trying to help?

556
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:11,630
You know,
I can do a little bit of something.

557
00:36:12,798 --> 00:36:14,299
Okay, do a little bit of this.

558
00:36:14,383 --> 00:36:16,510
Here. It's nothing. It's nothing.

559
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:18,178
Oh, it's...

560
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:20,305
Oh.

561
00:36:20,848 --> 00:36:23,100
We cannot forget the essentials.

562
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:25,727
I like the way you think.
Now you already know.

563
00:36:30,607 --> 00:36:31,650
Thanks.

564
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:40,868
Wow. This is a nice place.

565
00:36:45,497 --> 00:36:46,957
I'll take that.
Oh, thank you.

566
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:57,259
You know, uh,
Andy and Rachel got together.

567
00:36:58,427 --> 00:37:00,971
No, they didn't.
Yes, they did.

568
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:02,764
She's a liar.

569
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:08,228
Do you want something to drink?

570
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:10,397
Yeah. Whiskey, please.

571
00:37:11,064 --> 00:37:12,983
You want ice?
Put them rocks on that.

572
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:15,944
Thank you.
Sure.

573
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:23,452
Oh, this is cool.

574
00:37:23,535 --> 00:37:24,703
Oh, I never use it.

575
00:37:24,786 --> 00:37:26,371
Then why do you have it?

576
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,832
Uh, my dad gave it to me.

577
00:37:29,374 --> 00:37:30,584
Mmm.

578
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:33,045
Does it work?
It should.

579
00:37:34,129 --> 00:37:35,214
Okay.

580
00:37:36,507 --> 00:37:38,133
Let's see what I can do.

581
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:45,098
Yeah.

582
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:49,728
Al Green, my guy.

583
00:38:09,373 --> 00:38:10,582
Oh.

584
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:13,168
That's a bad boy right there.

585
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:14,753
Mmm-hmm.

586
00:38:19,383 --> 00:38:24,096
Lay your head.

587
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:28,308
Lay your head...

588
00:38:28,392 --> 00:38:30,394
Oh, yes. Good idea.

589
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:31,728
You too?
Yeah.

590
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:33,832
Hit me with a little... Da-da-da-da.

591
00:38:33,856 --> 00:38:35,232
Ah.
Right there. Yeah.

592
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:39,403
Hold your warm...

593
00:38:41,738 --> 00:38:43,782
Have you ever cheated on anyone?

594
00:38:44,408 --> 00:38:45,409
No.

595
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:49,955
But I did date a woman
that was in a relationship once.

596
00:38:50,038 --> 00:38:51,373
Not with you.
No.

597
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:55,460
Well, so it's not as bad as cheating,
but dishonest.

598
00:38:56,253 --> 00:38:57,296
Hmm.

599
00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:00,757
Yeah. She was much older.

600
00:39:02,134 --> 00:39:04,595
How much older?
Yeah, she was 42.

601
00:39:04,678 --> 00:39:07,014
How old were you?
Twenty-three.

602
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,975
Oh, yeah. Don't do that.

603
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:11,810
'Cause she pursued me, all right?

604
00:39:11,894 --> 00:39:13,353
Oh, so that's the sole reason?

605
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:16,273
Well, and she could cook, you know.

606
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:17,774
Cook?
Mmm-hmm.

607
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,235
Cooking what? What was she cooking?

608
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:21,486
Anything I wanted.

609
00:39:22,863 --> 00:39:24,573
And... sex, too.

610
00:39:25,157 --> 00:39:28,827
I mean, she wanted it all the time,
no matter where we were.

611
00:39:28,911 --> 00:39:30,037
Anytime, anyplace.

612
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,831
But one time, I had to fight her off
in an alleyway.

613
00:39:33,415 --> 00:39:34,895
'Cause I don't do outdoors like that.

614
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:36,668
Oh.
I'm not...

615
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:38,795
Whatever.

616
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:40,589
Yeah, she couldn't get enough
of my youth.

617
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:42,674
Shut up.
I'm serious.

618
00:39:53,352 --> 00:39:54,895
Okay.

619
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:56,522
Ooh.

620
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:08,367
Oh.

621
00:40:09,743 --> 00:40:10,744
Okay.

622
00:40:12,204 --> 00:40:13,205
Yeah.

623
00:40:13,288 --> 00:40:14,498
Baby...

624
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,445
Come over here and dance with me.

625
00:40:18,502 --> 00:40:20,629
Mmm. Nah.

626
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:21,713
Really?

627
00:40:22,214 --> 00:40:23,924
Nah, you come back over here.

628
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:29,179
Please come back over here.

629
00:40:29,263 --> 00:40:32,307
Whoa, baby.

630
00:40:34,935 --> 00:40:36,728
Why did it take so long?

631
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:38,522
Whoa, baby.

632
00:40:40,315 --> 00:40:42,276
Only made my love grow strong.

633
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:44,486
Baby.

634
00:40:45,571 --> 00:40:48,073
Yeah, yeah

635
00:40:48,156 --> 00:40:50,576
I'm so glad you're mine.

636
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:54,788
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

637
00:40:54,872 --> 00:40:57,541
When darkness gather round me...

638
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:00,419
Why you got your head down
like you praying?

639
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:04,173
'Cause I might need to.

640
00:41:07,885 --> 00:41:09,178
What would you pray for?

641
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:14,641
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...

642
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:15,976
Willpower.

643
00:41:19,438 --> 00:41:21,440
Why don't we just blame it on the storm?

644
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,984
Whoa, oh, whoa, whoa.

645
00:42:10,531 --> 00:42:13,909
Needed some Ricolas.

646
00:42:14,326 --> 00:42:18,330
Stepped in CVS.

647
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:21,834
Saw you in the corner.

648
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:25,838
I was looking a mess.

649
00:42:26,672 --> 00:42:30,467
You didn't notice.

650
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:33,929
Jason was instigating

651
00:42:34,012 --> 00:42:38,392
I wanna bring you closer.

652
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:43,814
Tired of waiting.

653
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:51,488
Tired...
Tired of waiting.

654
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:01,331
Ooh.

655
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:05,627
Ooh.

656
00:43:06,128 --> 00:43:09,214
Ooh.

657
00:43:10,299 --> 00:43:13,260
Ooh.

658
00:43:35,073 --> 00:43:36,158
What?

659
00:43:59,014 --> 00:44:00,724
Excuse me. Excuse me.

660
00:44:11,151 --> 00:44:12,551
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

661
00:44:16,073 --> 00:44:17,324
Hey.

662
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,286
Going uptown.

663
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:22,371
Good?
Get in.

664
00:44:47,437 --> 00:44:48,438
Ooh. Ah.

665
00:44:48,522 --> 00:44:49,791
Come on, come on.
Hey.

666
00:44:51,233 --> 00:44:52,442
Oh.

667
00:44:53,026 --> 00:44:54,903
What's up, boy? Hey.

668
00:44:54,987 --> 00:44:56,029
Hi.
Hi.

669
00:44:56,113 --> 00:44:57,114
This is Mae.

670
00:44:57,197 --> 00:44:58,258
Hi, Mae.
Nice to meet you.

671
00:44:58,282 --> 00:44:59,384
Hey, baby.
Hi.

672
00:44:59,408 --> 00:45:00,409
Let me take your jackets.

673
00:45:00,492 --> 00:45:01,803
Hi.
Yeah, yeah, come on, y'all.

674
00:45:01,827 --> 00:45:02,953
Give me your coats.

675
00:45:03,036 --> 00:45:04,037
Stay on the stairs.

676
00:45:04,121 --> 00:45:05,640
Go get a towel, baby.
They're very wet.

677
00:45:05,664 --> 00:45:07,141
Okay.
Yeah, get a towel.

678
00:45:07,165 --> 00:45:08,876
It's right here.
Thank you.

679
00:45:08,959 --> 00:45:10,002
You're welcome.

680
00:45:11,044 --> 00:45:12,171
How about some wine?

681
00:45:12,254 --> 00:45:13,672
Oh.
Yes, please.

682
00:45:13,755 --> 00:45:15,340
I am talking to Miss Mae, thank you.

683
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:18,468
I would love some. Thank you.
Okay.

684
00:45:21,471 --> 00:45:23,140
What is that?
A flying pig.

685
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:26,202
Hey, man, look what happened.
Man, you were supposed to be here earlier.

686
00:45:26,226 --> 00:45:27,936
Yeah, I got stuck at her place.

687
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:30,939
I'm sure.

688
00:45:32,316 --> 00:45:34,401
She's so nice.

689
00:45:35,777 --> 00:45:38,405
Why do you look like that?
Look like what?

690
00:45:38,488 --> 00:45:43,160
Like you have a concussion.
Or, like, she's Yoruba and knows voodoo.

691
00:45:43,243 --> 00:45:44,244
Okay.

692
00:45:44,328 --> 00:45:45,972
Mmm-hmm.
Look at him, baby. He's in love.

693
00:45:45,996 --> 00:45:47,849
I... I never said that, all right?

694
00:45:47,873 --> 00:45:49,100
Brother, you ain't got to say it.

695
00:45:49,124 --> 00:45:51,543
I can see it all over your face
with that sappy-ass look.

696
00:45:51,627 --> 00:45:53,837
It's embarrassing.
Leave him alone.

697
00:45:53,921 --> 00:45:55,214
Yeah, leave me alone.

698
00:45:55,297 --> 00:45:58,509
What? What? Baby, you're the one that said
that she's Ya-rooba, uh, Yor-ooba...

699
00:45:58,592 --> 00:46:00,302
Yoruba.
Yoruba.

700
00:46:00,385 --> 00:46:02,930
First of all, uh, she's not Yoruba.

701
00:46:03,013 --> 00:46:06,725
And what's that got to do with anything?
I just meant that she was really nice.

702
00:46:06,808 --> 00:46:08,810
Yeah. Okay.
And you seem smitten.

703
00:46:08,894 --> 00:46:10,705
Look at her with the babies.
All right.

704
00:46:10,729 --> 00:46:12,790
Don't gas him up,
'cause he's probably gonna fuck it up.

705
00:46:12,814 --> 00:46:14,334
Ah, maybe I won't.
You don't know that.

706
00:46:15,025 --> 00:46:16,360
I'm pretty sure about that.

707
00:46:16,944 --> 00:46:19,196
You guys are so pretty.
Tell me your names again.

708
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:20,614
Sandrine.
Sofia.

709
00:46:20,697 --> 00:46:23,367
Well, I'm Mae. Great to meet you.

710
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:24,868
I thought your name was Tessa.

711
00:46:25,661 --> 00:46:27,913
You did?
Uh, who's Tessa?

712
00:46:27,996 --> 00:46:31,041
Uncle Michael's girlfriend.
She lives in New Orleans.

713
00:46:32,501 --> 00:46:34,962
It's not his girlfriend anymore, Sofia.

714
00:46:35,045 --> 00:46:38,298
I forgot.
I thought they were gonna get married.

715
00:46:38,882 --> 00:46:40,592
What makes you say that?

716
00:46:40,676 --> 00:46:42,928
Because that's what
Uncle Michael said.

717
00:46:43,637 --> 00:46:45,197
You do look like her though.

718
00:46:45,597 --> 00:46:46,682
So he has a type?

719
00:46:47,182 --> 00:46:48,350
What does that mean?

720
00:46:49,101 --> 00:46:51,687
Uh, when's the last time you saw Tessa?

721
00:46:54,731 --> 00:46:57,943
Sandrine, go read to your sister
until she falls asleep.

722
00:46:58,026 --> 00:46:59,027
Okay.

723
00:46:59,111 --> 00:47:00,404
But I can read, too.

724
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:02,781
Okay, well, y'all can read to each other.

725
00:47:02,865 --> 00:47:03,907
Thank you.

726
00:47:04,408 --> 00:47:06,702
I don't want to hear anything up there
except reading.

727
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:08,495
Okay.

728
00:47:09,371 --> 00:47:12,124
That deep sigh, little girl.

729
00:47:14,877 --> 00:47:19,923
So, we're at the reception,
and everybody is looking for Michael.

730
00:47:20,007 --> 00:47:22,342
Like, where is he?
He's supposed to do the toast, and...

731
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:26,305
So, who... Did he do the speech?

732
00:47:26,388 --> 00:47:27,657
No!
No, he didn't do the speech.

733
00:47:27,681 --> 00:47:30,225
Our cousin Larry did it,
and he stutters a lot.

734
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:32,996
He was real nervous 'cause he didn't know
he was gonna be talking anyways,

735
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,123
so now he extra stuttering.
I got stage fright.

736
00:47:35,147 --> 00:47:36,624
There's so many good things
to say about you.

737
00:47:36,648 --> 00:47:38,835
Then you put Larry up there?
I didn't know, you know...

738
00:47:38,859 --> 00:47:41,796
We had to edit it out the wedding video.
Wasn't even that hard to find.

739
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:44,489
It was terrible.
I had a top hat on, like...

740
00:47:45,032 --> 00:47:47,743
A top hat?
Oh, gosh, the top hat.

741
00:47:47,826 --> 00:47:49,746
A top hat.
What was the theme of the...

742
00:47:49,786 --> 00:47:51,788
It wasn't no theme.
There was no theme, Mae.

743
00:47:51,872 --> 00:47:53,957
There was no theme.
He wore a top hat.

744
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:55,810
Like, the wedding photos look crazy.
Oh, God.

745
00:47:55,834 --> 00:47:58,354
Everybody else got a regular fade,
but he got on a Monopoly hat.

746
00:47:59,463 --> 00:48:01,816
And I was trying to be nice.
I just thought it was cool.

747
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,218
It looked cool.
No, it didn't look cool.

748
00:48:04,301 --> 00:48:06,341
The kids kept asking you
to take a rabbit out of it.

749
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:08,805
You know what I mean?
It made you look stupid.

750
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:10,307
Okay.
Oh, God.

751
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:12,893
People started playing...
Hi-de, hi-de, hi-de, ho.

752
00:48:12,976 --> 00:48:15,979
That's what he looked like
he was supposed to be singing.

753
00:48:16,063 --> 00:48:18,524
Oh, gosh. Oh, goodness.

754
00:48:19,149 --> 00:48:21,985
I can laugh now, but it was...

755
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:24,380
It was not very funny on the day of.
She was really upset.

756
00:48:24,404 --> 00:48:26,406
I mean, I laughed at the day,
'cause I know you,

757
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:28,033
and this is how... It's our dynamic.

758
00:48:28,116 --> 00:48:30,202
Yeah, he does stuff like that.

759
00:48:30,285 --> 00:48:32,663
He's very smart, but he do dumb stuff.

760
00:48:32,746 --> 00:48:35,332
So, how about you tell me
what you do to keep, you know,

761
00:48:35,415 --> 00:48:37,227
whatever you got going on, going.
I mean, listen.

762
00:48:37,251 --> 00:48:38,478
We talk about other people.

763
00:48:38,502 --> 00:48:40,313
That makes us happy, actually.
Clearly.

764
00:48:40,337 --> 00:48:42,899
We go people watching. That's what we do.
He keeps me laughing.

765
00:48:42,923 --> 00:48:47,636
And really, if it weren't for streaming,
divorce would be right around the corner.

766
00:48:49,012 --> 00:48:51,181
Wait, you would leave me
if we couldn't stream movies?

767
00:48:51,265 --> 00:48:54,309
Baby, I'm joking. I'm joking.
I'm joking, I'm joking.

768
00:48:54,393 --> 00:48:55,686
All right, I was, like, damn.

769
00:48:56,562 --> 00:48:58,289
I'm an interesting guy,
you know what I mean?

770
00:48:58,313 --> 00:48:59,374
Baby, you are interesting.

771
00:48:59,398 --> 00:49:01,598
That's right.
I was only joking. I didn't mean that.

772
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:03,402
You know, don't worry.
Wow.

773
00:49:04,486 --> 00:49:05,696
Y'all came in that storm?

774
00:49:05,779 --> 00:49:07,656
That storm is crazy.

775
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:10,117
Look, what did y'all do
when the power went out today?

776
00:49:11,827 --> 00:49:13,287
Um...

777
00:49:16,248 --> 00:49:17,624
Uh...
Oh.

778
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:19,334
Okay, well, next topic.
Okay.

779
00:49:19,418 --> 00:49:21,062
What is all those sounds about?

780
00:49:21,086 --> 00:49:22,462
Yeah, I mean, you know...

781
00:49:22,546 --> 00:49:25,549
You know, she did
the little sip-and-smile thing, like...

782
00:49:25,632 --> 00:49:26,717
Leave her alone.

783
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,320
But we're all grown.
Look, if y'all did it, y'all did it.

784
00:49:29,344 --> 00:49:30,488
It ain't a big thing.
Stop.

785
00:49:30,512 --> 00:49:31,930
People do it all the time.

786
00:49:32,014 --> 00:49:34,214
Mae... Ooh!
This is the best do-it weather.

787
00:49:35,058 --> 00:49:36,685
Mommy?
Yes?

788
00:49:36,768 --> 00:49:38,979
Can we sleep in your bed?

789
00:49:39,688 --> 00:49:40,772
Daddy?

790
00:49:41,607 --> 00:49:44,693
Yeah, we'll be up there in a second
to tuck y'all in.

791
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:47,279
Stop listening
to the grown-up conversations.

792
00:49:48,572 --> 00:49:51,533
Do not turn that TV on.
Do not turn the TV on.

793
00:49:53,243 --> 00:49:55,412
That's also marriage...
I just repeat what she says.

794
00:49:55,495 --> 00:49:57,372
I don't even know what to say
half the time.

795
00:49:57,456 --> 00:49:59,225
All right, we're going.
Know what I mean?

796
00:49:59,249 --> 00:50:00,518
Good night, guys.
Bye. Good night.

797
00:50:00,542 --> 00:50:01,853
If you need anything...
Good night.

798
00:50:01,877 --> 00:50:03,477
Good night.
No, I don't want y'all...

799
00:50:03,504 --> 00:50:04,564
Don't be angry.
Come on, sir.

800
00:50:04,588 --> 00:50:06,316
I'm just saying, they already did...
Let's go.

801
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,151
Good night.
Don't be doing that in here, okay?

802
00:50:08,175 --> 00:50:09,944
Sandrine!
There's children here, okay?

803
00:50:09,968 --> 00:50:11,029
All right.
All right.

804
00:50:11,053 --> 00:50:13,133
See y'all tomorrow, okay?
See you in the morning.

805
00:51:20,038 --> 00:51:21,248
It's open.

806
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:28,964
Smell good in here.
What you cooking?

807
00:51:29,047 --> 00:51:30,257
Red beans and rice.

808
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:38,390
Put that down.

809
00:51:39,183 --> 00:51:42,269
You are always taking pictures of me.
I want to have one of you.

810
00:51:58,202 --> 00:51:59,703
Don't you want more than this?

811
00:52:00,454 --> 00:52:01,455
What you mean?

812
00:52:02,331 --> 00:52:04,750
More... than what we have.

813
00:52:08,462 --> 00:52:10,881
No. I want you.

814
00:52:14,176 --> 00:52:16,616
I want to be married to you.
I'm not ready to get married.

815
00:52:18,222 --> 00:52:19,306
What more do you want?

816
00:52:21,808 --> 00:52:25,687
I want people to know who I am,
admire my photographs.

817
00:52:25,771 --> 00:52:29,525
I love you, but my greatest accomplishment
each day cannot be cooking your dinner.

818
00:52:30,859 --> 00:52:33,237
I have never understood
how to make you happy.

819
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:35,822
What if we moved?

820
00:52:35,906 --> 00:52:38,116
Where?
New York.

821
00:52:40,202 --> 00:52:41,662
I can't see myself there.

822
00:52:42,287 --> 00:52:43,956
I can't stay here anymore.

823
00:52:47,376 --> 00:52:48,877
And where does that leave us?

824
00:54:36,568 --> 00:54:37,611
Hey.

825
00:54:38,111 --> 00:54:39,154
Hey.

826
00:54:41,406 --> 00:54:42,991
I think it stopped raining.
Yeah?

827
00:54:47,538 --> 00:54:48,539
You want to go outside?

828
00:54:50,249 --> 00:54:51,625
Do you want to go outside?

829
00:54:53,293 --> 00:54:54,419
Yeah.

830
00:55:01,635 --> 00:55:03,262
We survived.
Yeah.

831
00:55:04,429 --> 00:55:06,765
Now we got the whole street
to ourselves, too.

832
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:11,645
Who's Tessa?

833
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:16,567
Your nieces had a lot to say.

834
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:19,653
Yes, she's a girl that I used to date.

835
00:55:20,445 --> 00:55:21,613
When?

836
00:55:21,697 --> 00:55:23,240
Uh, a few months ago.

837
00:55:23,323 --> 00:55:24,366
A few months ago?

838
00:55:24,783 --> 00:55:26,493
Uh, few... few weeks ago, actually.

839
00:55:26,577 --> 00:55:27,617
Which is it?

840
00:55:27,661 --> 00:55:28,954
See, now I sound like I'm lying.

841
00:55:29,037 --> 00:55:30,873
Are you?
No.

842
00:55:30,956 --> 00:55:32,624
So...

843
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:36,044
So, I... We broke up before I met you.

844
00:55:37,212 --> 00:55:38,881
She lives in a different city, so...

845
00:55:39,756 --> 00:55:41,175
Why didn't you tell me?

846
00:55:42,676 --> 00:55:44,219
Because we're not together.

847
00:55:44,678 --> 00:55:47,389
And because I'm here with you right now.

848
00:55:51,226 --> 00:55:52,311
So, what about you?

849
00:55:53,061 --> 00:55:54,396
What about me?

850
00:55:54,479 --> 00:55:55,898
Who are you talking to?

851
00:55:56,732 --> 00:55:58,150
Nobody, really.

852
00:55:58,609 --> 00:56:00,944
"Nobody, really." What does that mean?

853
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,615
Nobody anymore.

854
00:56:06,033 --> 00:56:07,159
Hmm.

855
00:56:10,454 --> 00:56:11,914
Listen, I, um...

856
00:56:14,333 --> 00:56:17,586
Maybe this doesn't matter, but...

857
00:56:18,253 --> 00:56:19,713
What? What is it?

858
00:56:21,632 --> 00:56:24,843
I applied for a job... in London.

859
00:56:26,261 --> 00:56:27,262
Oh.

860
00:56:27,346 --> 00:56:29,139
And, you know...

861
00:56:29,223 --> 00:56:31,892
It may not mean anything
because we just met.

862
00:56:32,518 --> 00:56:33,644
Right.

863
00:56:33,727 --> 00:56:35,145
But I think it matters.

864
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:41,360
Why London?

865
00:56:43,779 --> 00:56:46,532
Well, I felt like I needed a change.

866
00:56:49,535 --> 00:56:51,912
And you want a change right now?

867
00:56:51,995 --> 00:56:53,872
Well, not tonight, but...

868
00:56:57,042 --> 00:57:01,588
See, my brother got me scared to say
anything of consequence to you, but...

869
00:57:05,008 --> 00:57:07,302
I want to continue getting to know you.

870
00:57:10,389 --> 00:57:12,224
I want to get to know you, too.

871
00:57:16,103 --> 00:57:17,729
Mommy. Come on!
Sandrine!

872
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:19,314
All right, Kyle.
Okay.

873
00:57:19,398 --> 00:57:21,149
Guys.
What do you want to eat?

874
00:57:21,233 --> 00:57:23,628
I love you. I'm gonna bring it back
in two pieces for you, bro.

875
00:57:23,652 --> 00:57:26,572
What do you mean, "two pieces"?
Don't play with me like that, all right?

876
00:57:26,655 --> 00:57:28,550
Put some gas in there if you get a ch...

877
00:57:28,574 --> 00:57:30,617
Wait, what? You want what?

878
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:32,160
Pancakes!

879
00:57:32,244 --> 00:57:33,412
Why are y'all yelling at me?

880
00:57:33,495 --> 00:57:35,335
You in the kitchen with your mama.
Pancake!

881
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:50,350
When we met.

882
00:57:50,804 --> 00:57:53,432
Always knew

883
00:57:53,515 --> 00:57:54,766
I would feel...

884
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:56,518
I've been in New York for three months.

885
00:57:58,687 --> 00:58:02,149
On my mind constantly...

886
00:58:02,733 --> 00:58:06,987
Why would I hire some girl
who just got off the bus as my assistant?

887
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,739
Because I'm talented.

888
00:58:08,989 --> 00:58:10,240
Did I say that?

889
00:58:10,741 --> 00:58:12,618
No. Uh, no, sir.

890
00:58:12,701 --> 00:58:15,787
Here by me, baby.

891
00:58:16,246 --> 00:58:20,918
You let my love fly freely.

892
00:58:21,376 --> 00:58:24,880
I want you in my life...

893
00:58:24,963 --> 00:58:27,341
Because I'll work harder
than any of those silver-spoon,

894
00:58:27,424 --> 00:58:29,635
Upper East Side debutantes
waiting in line outside...

895
00:58:32,554 --> 00:58:34,348
whose daddies got them this interview.

896
00:58:34,431 --> 00:58:37,100
And will quit
as soon as they husband arrives.

897
00:58:39,311 --> 00:58:43,899
Nothing else can compare...

898
00:58:45,234 --> 00:58:46,276
Hmm.

899
00:58:48,612 --> 00:58:50,280
Pack it up.

900
00:58:50,364 --> 00:58:54,660
I'm...

901
00:58:54,993 --> 00:58:58,997
Caught up in the rapture of love.

902
00:59:00,457 --> 00:59:03,877
I'm...

903
00:59:15,973 --> 00:59:17,766
Hello?
Denise.

904
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:18,934
Christina?

905
00:59:20,394 --> 00:59:21,687
Why haven't you called?

906
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:23,438
I just got a phone at home.

907
00:59:23,522 --> 00:59:25,899
I wish you was here.
Christina, you have to come home.

908
00:59:26,525 --> 00:59:29,361
I know. He must be furious at me.

909
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:31,154
But I needed some time.

910
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:34,074
I'm gonna talk to him,
and he'll understand.

911
00:59:34,616 --> 00:59:36,702
Hell, he might even move here with me.

912
00:59:38,704 --> 00:59:39,705
How is he?

913
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:44,835
Your mother.

914
00:59:45,377 --> 00:59:46,962
What about my mama?

915
00:59:49,298 --> 00:59:50,424
Denise?

916
00:59:51,425 --> 00:59:52,426
Is she okay?

917
00:59:55,429 --> 00:59:56,597
She died.

918
01:00:11,361 --> 01:00:15,449
I think she asked me to leave
because she knew she was sick.

919
01:00:16,158 --> 01:00:17,868
She didn't want me to see her weak.

920
01:00:22,581 --> 01:00:23,707
I'm sorry, Christina.

921
01:00:36,678 --> 01:00:38,305
I thought he'd be here.

922
01:00:39,932 --> 01:00:41,808
He's angrier than I thought.

923
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:45,979
I'm gonna go see him.

924
01:00:52,653 --> 01:00:54,488
There's something you should know.

925
01:00:56,615 --> 01:00:57,658
What?

926
01:00:58,951 --> 01:00:59,952
He got married.

927
01:01:04,706 --> 01:01:06,208
Married to who?

928
01:01:07,334 --> 01:01:08,460
Ashley Prentiss.

929
01:01:08,544 --> 01:01:09,628
That's not funny.

930
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:14,216
That's impossible.

931
01:01:15,843 --> 01:01:16,963
I've been gone three months.

932
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:19,304
You should've said something
before you left.

933
01:01:20,264 --> 01:01:21,390
After the second month,

934
01:01:21,473 --> 01:01:23,673
he was hung up on the idea
that you weren't coming back.

935
01:02:11,607 --> 01:02:13,567
Let's do one more of those.

936
01:02:16,904 --> 01:02:18,155
All right.

937
01:02:19,865 --> 01:02:21,909
Good job. Move this way.

938
01:02:21,992 --> 01:02:24,745
Yeah, let me get you right here.

939
01:02:25,787 --> 01:02:27,998
Look off out into the window for me.

940
01:02:29,166 --> 01:02:31,293
Yeah, right there.

941
01:03:19,758 --> 01:03:20,968
Come here, Mae.

942
01:04:14,646 --> 01:04:16,273
Peter said you were here.

943
01:04:17,816 --> 01:04:19,276
I sold Violet's house.

944
01:04:21,612 --> 01:04:23,322
It only took you four years to come back.

945
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:27,868
Hi, Isaac.

946
01:04:33,498 --> 01:04:34,583
How's New York?

947
01:04:35,292 --> 01:04:36,502
I like it.

948
01:04:41,131 --> 01:04:42,132
Who's this?

949
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:46,678
My name's Mae.

950
01:04:46,762 --> 01:04:48,514
You look exactly like your mother.

951
01:04:51,016 --> 01:04:52,142
She's beautiful.

952
01:04:53,477 --> 01:04:54,686
Thank you.

953
01:04:56,355 --> 01:04:57,773
Heard you got married.

954
01:04:58,899 --> 01:05:00,067
Congratulations.

955
01:05:04,321 --> 01:05:05,322
Thank you.

956
01:05:17,417 --> 01:05:18,418
Why...

957
01:05:20,587 --> 01:05:21,672
What?

958
01:05:25,551 --> 01:05:27,302
Why don't you come over for dinner?

959
01:05:28,011 --> 01:05:29,805
Ashley would be more than happy to cook.

960
01:05:29,888 --> 01:05:32,182
No. That's kind.

961
01:05:32,266 --> 01:05:33,267
No, really.

962
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:35,686
No, we have a bus to catch.

963
01:05:42,734 --> 01:05:44,403
Can I drive you to the station?

964
01:05:45,529 --> 01:05:47,739
I didn't get a chance
to take you last time.

965
01:05:54,329 --> 01:05:55,372
Okay.

966
01:06:44,463 --> 01:06:45,672
Please don't get out.

967
01:08:44,208 --> 01:08:45,334
Can I help you?

968
01:08:50,255 --> 01:08:51,882
Hi. I'm Mae Morton.

969
01:09:00,389 --> 01:09:02,684
I'm Christina Eames' daughter.

970
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,610
Is she here?

971
01:09:12,611 --> 01:09:13,862
She passed away.

972
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:27,501
I'm sorry to hear that.

973
01:09:36,635 --> 01:09:37,635
When?

974
01:09:38,428 --> 01:09:39,595
About a month ago.

975
01:09:45,352 --> 01:09:46,519
She, um...

976
01:09:48,981 --> 01:09:50,190
left this for you.

977
01:09:51,148 --> 01:09:52,860
She asked me to give it to you.

978
01:10:04,454 --> 01:10:06,081
Do you know what it says?

979
01:10:07,457 --> 01:10:08,834
No, I didn't read it.

980
01:10:12,379 --> 01:10:14,423
I wasn't sure she'd remember me.

981
01:10:15,215 --> 01:10:16,216
She did.

982
01:10:21,847 --> 01:10:24,016
She left me a letter, too.

983
01:10:24,349 --> 01:10:26,310
Yeah?
Yeah.

984
01:10:33,984 --> 01:10:36,195
It said I was your daughter.

985
01:10:58,342 --> 01:11:00,052
I was too afraid to ask.

986
01:11:00,844 --> 01:11:02,221
Ask what?

987
01:11:02,304 --> 01:11:05,307
When she brought you home,
I wanted to ask if you were mine.

988
01:11:10,771 --> 01:11:11,980
Why didn't you?

989
01:11:13,899 --> 01:11:15,025
I was married.

990
01:11:16,193 --> 01:11:17,653
She had a life in New York.

991
01:11:20,864 --> 01:11:23,700
I don't know, I had to believe
if you were my daughter...

992
01:11:26,328 --> 01:11:28,080
she would've told me.

993
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:31,750
She thought it would be easier for you...

994
01:11:33,877 --> 01:11:34,920
not knowing.

995
01:11:42,594 --> 01:11:44,972
It would've been easier
if I just would've asked.

996
01:12:00,863 --> 01:12:03,198
Can you stay for some boiled crab?

997
01:12:05,993 --> 01:12:07,119
Yeah.

998
01:12:10,372 --> 01:12:11,498
Hey.

999
01:12:12,249 --> 01:12:13,542
I need to talk to you.

1000
01:12:15,836 --> 01:12:17,004
You're making me nervous.

1001
01:12:17,754 --> 01:12:19,047
When are you ever nervous?

1002
01:12:19,464 --> 01:12:21,300
When someone's like,
"I need to talk to you."

1003
01:12:26,138 --> 01:12:27,306
What is it?

1004
01:12:28,015 --> 01:12:29,641
I just found out I got the job.

1005
01:12:29,725 --> 01:12:31,310
Oh, I can't believe you.

1006
01:12:31,393 --> 01:12:35,689
I think the words you're looking for are,
"Congratulations. Good job."

1007
01:12:36,106 --> 01:12:37,441
Congratulations.

1008
01:12:37,524 --> 01:12:38,817
There you are. Thank you.

1009
01:12:39,234 --> 01:12:40,694
I hope it doesn't work out.

1010
01:12:42,654 --> 01:12:43,655
When do you start?

1011
01:12:43,739 --> 01:12:44,865
Uh, a couple weeks.

1012
01:12:45,449 --> 01:12:47,868
You still owe me a story... before you go.

1013
01:12:47,951 --> 01:12:49,161
Yeah.

1014
01:12:51,163 --> 01:12:53,332
You sure you don't want me
to find you something else?

1015
01:12:53,415 --> 01:12:54,750
You know what you could do?

1016
01:12:54,833 --> 01:12:55,876
Hmm?

1017
01:12:55,959 --> 01:12:57,336
You could promote Andy.

1018
01:12:58,003 --> 01:13:00,005
Right?
I'm not... I won't do that.

1019
01:13:00,797 --> 01:13:02,925
Maybe. Maybe.

1020
01:13:03,008 --> 01:13:04,426
Yeah.
Unlikely.

1021
01:13:06,678 --> 01:13:09,199
Maybe I moved on because I was scared

1022
01:13:09,223 --> 01:13:11,350
I couldn't make Christina happy.

1023
01:13:11,433 --> 01:13:12,643
What happened?

1024
01:13:12,726 --> 01:13:17,022
I was afraid of failing her,
that she'd resent me eventually.

1025
01:13:38,168 --> 01:13:40,212
Okay, look, man,
you sure you want to do this?

1026
01:13:40,295 --> 01:13:42,297
Yes. Yes.

1027
01:13:42,381 --> 01:13:44,007
Yeah.
London, Michael? Huh?

1028
01:13:44,508 --> 01:13:46,552
Like, for real,
you want to move to London?

1029
01:13:46,635 --> 01:13:48,971
You understand there's a five-hour
time difference, right?

1030
01:13:49,054 --> 01:13:51,265
Of course I know that. Yes, I know that.

1031
01:13:51,932 --> 01:13:54,052
If you know that,
then have some respect for me, okay?

1032
01:13:54,101 --> 01:13:55,894
Want me to change my schedule
around for you?

1033
01:13:55,978 --> 01:13:58,164
Waking up in the middle of the night,
answering your phone calls?

1034
01:13:58,188 --> 01:13:59,290
I don't want to be doing all that.

1035
01:13:59,314 --> 01:14:00,649
What's this look I'm see...

1036
01:14:00,732 --> 01:14:03,193
Is this... Oh, you're gonna miss me, huh?

1037
01:14:03,902 --> 01:14:05,088
Nope.
You're gonna miss me.

1038
01:14:05,112 --> 01:14:07,531
I ain't gonna miss... No, I'm not.
I'm not gonna miss you.

1039
01:14:07,614 --> 01:14:10,242
Stop playing with me.
Okay, yes. Maybe a little bit.

1040
01:14:10,325 --> 01:14:11,725
Oh, there it is, see.
All right?

1041
01:14:12,369 --> 01:14:16,290
Man, I don't know, I just...
I have to do this.

1042
01:14:17,332 --> 01:14:18,500
I need this.

1043
01:14:18,959 --> 01:14:20,979
You're not gonna talk to this girl
before you leave?

1044
01:14:21,003 --> 01:14:22,605
I don't know.
I think you should do that.

1045
01:14:22,629 --> 01:14:24,840
I mean, she called,
but I didn't call her back.

1046
01:14:25,507 --> 01:14:26,925
Wait, you ain't called her back?

1047
01:14:27,843 --> 01:14:29,386
That's not like Michael.

1048
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:31,805
I just didn't know what to say.

1049
01:14:32,639 --> 01:14:34,808
And that's your plan, right?
Just gonna act funny?

1050
01:14:34,892 --> 01:14:36,768
Why you doing this?
What...

1051
01:14:37,394 --> 01:14:40,063
You're the one who told me
not to get involved, remember?

1052
01:14:40,147 --> 01:14:41,708
You said...
"Don't get involved."

1053
01:14:41,732 --> 01:14:44,610
Okay, I didn't... First of all,
I don't sound like a mad scientist.

1054
01:14:44,693 --> 01:14:46,053
That's not how I talk.

1055
01:14:46,111 --> 01:14:47,446
And look, I know what I said.

1056
01:14:47,529 --> 01:14:49,281
I said don't get involved too quickly.

1057
01:14:49,364 --> 01:14:51,634
All right. Okay. Semantics.
'Cause that's what you usually do.

1058
01:14:51,658 --> 01:14:54,745
You always move into stuff fast.
I was just being honest with you.

1059
01:14:54,828 --> 01:14:56,288
Okay. Yeah.

1060
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:59,291
Text her or something.
Whatever. All right.

1061
01:14:59,374 --> 01:15:01,376
DM her on Instagram. I don't know.

1062
01:15:02,628 --> 01:15:06,673
I mean, look, you're a grown man,
and you got to do what's best for you.

1063
01:15:06,757 --> 01:15:07,758
Yeah.

1064
01:15:10,385 --> 01:15:11,887
When do you leave?

1065
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:14,598
Uh, I'll go back to Louisiana
a couple days, finish up work.

1066
01:15:15,724 --> 01:15:16,892
Then I'm packing.

1067
01:15:21,813 --> 01:15:24,942
And don't make this all dramatic.
Come on, give me some toast, huh?

1068
01:15:27,569 --> 01:15:30,364
Come on, meet me over here. Get over here.

1069
01:15:30,447 --> 01:15:31,448
Boom. There we go.

1070
01:15:33,116 --> 01:15:35,744
Please don't push me, I'm on the edge.

1071
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:39,998
I don't care too much,
but you want it, baby.

1072
01:15:42,167 --> 01:15:45,045
Let's go through it together.

1073
01:15:45,128 --> 01:15:48,006
Maybe it's for the better

1074
01:15:48,090 --> 01:15:49,550
'Cause you'll let me be.

1075
01:15:49,633 --> 01:15:51,885
Oh, babe, I let you go there.

1076
01:15:51,969 --> 01:15:53,595
To roll up and then go back.

1077
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:55,764
Meet me at the corner, baby,
you know where.

1078
01:15:55,848 --> 01:15:58,475
Is it cruel of me.

1079
01:15:58,559 --> 01:16:00,519
To pretend I can't see...

1080
01:16:04,231 --> 01:16:06,149
Hey.
Hey.

1081
01:16:06,567 --> 01:16:07,818
What you doing here?

1082
01:16:08,402 --> 01:16:09,570
Another interview.

1083
01:16:10,153 --> 01:16:11,321
You almost done?

1084
01:16:11,905 --> 01:16:12,948
Almost.

1085
01:16:22,541 --> 01:16:23,959
I wasn't expecting that at all.

1086
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:29,256
I tried to call you to tell you.
You didn't call me back.

1087
01:16:29,631 --> 01:16:30,674
Right.

1088
01:16:31,216 --> 01:16:33,844
"Hi, Mae. Hello. It's Michael.
I'm calling you back."

1089
01:16:34,803 --> 01:16:35,846
I could've said that.

1090
01:16:35,929 --> 01:16:38,473
"Things were awkward
the morning after the storm,"

1091
01:16:38,557 --> 01:16:40,368
"but that doesn't change
what happened between us."

1092
01:16:40,392 --> 01:16:42,477
Oh, you're good.
No, I like that one.

1093
01:16:42,561 --> 01:16:43,562
Thank you.

1094
01:16:50,194 --> 01:16:51,945
Getting to know each other was good.

1095
01:16:52,446 --> 01:16:56,950
Yeah, well,
I liked getting to know each other.

1096
01:16:58,035 --> 01:16:59,161
Yeah.

1097
01:16:59,912 --> 01:17:01,997
So, what, you just leaving New York

1098
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:05,292
and trading in the Kerry James Marshall
for the Bywater?

1099
01:17:05,375 --> 01:17:07,002
Do you see me living here?

1100
01:17:07,085 --> 01:17:09,713
Ah, I don't know.
I like this casual you.

1101
01:17:09,796 --> 01:17:11,548
So, you're saying I'm uptight in New York?

1102
01:17:11,632 --> 01:17:15,219
Nah, I mean, you just seem relaxed.

1103
01:17:20,766 --> 01:17:24,645
I'm going to Christina's house
at Pointe à la Hache later.

1104
01:17:26,522 --> 01:17:27,648
Mmm.

1105
01:17:29,149 --> 01:17:30,567
Do you want to come with me?

1106
01:17:30,651 --> 01:17:33,237
Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to come.

1107
01:17:34,821 --> 01:17:36,448
What you trying to listen to?

1108
01:17:37,741 --> 01:17:38,825
Drake.

1109
01:17:40,077 --> 01:17:43,247
I... I cannot stand Drake.

1110
01:17:43,872 --> 01:17:47,125
You know I don't want to hear no Drake.
All right, put some Kendrick on.

1111
01:17:47,835 --> 01:17:49,962
Not in my car. Come on.

1112
01:17:50,504 --> 01:17:53,006
I'm not putting on Kendrick.
That is a fact.

1113
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:54,174
Depressing car ride.

1114
01:17:54,258 --> 01:17:56,778
We're gonna get pulled over by the police
listening to Kendrick.

1115
01:17:57,469 --> 01:17:59,054
It's...

1116
01:18:01,014 --> 01:18:03,225
Did you say your ex-girlfriend
lived in New Orleans?

1117
01:18:05,310 --> 01:18:06,436
I never said that.

1118
01:18:07,104 --> 01:18:09,147
You didn't?
No.

1119
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:15,654
Okay, you know what, you're right.
It wasn't you. It was... Sandrine.

1120
01:18:15,737 --> 01:18:17,406
Oh, my God.
Or Sofia. Was it...

1121
01:18:17,489 --> 01:18:19,575
Sandrine and Sofia again.

1122
01:18:19,658 --> 01:18:21,535
Could you just tell me
everything they said?

1123
01:18:21,618 --> 01:18:25,038
You just tell me now, word for word.
Why would I violate the sister code?

1124
01:18:25,122 --> 01:18:27,749
Wow.
No. Just answer my question.

1125
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:29,894
Did you... Did you happen to see her
while you were here?

1126
01:18:29,918 --> 01:18:31,795
See who?
Your ex-girl.

1127
01:18:31,879 --> 01:18:32,880
No.

1128
01:18:32,963 --> 01:18:34,882
I have not seen her.

1129
01:18:35,591 --> 01:18:37,718
Okay, you don't have to get all defensive.

1130
01:18:37,801 --> 01:18:39,737
I'm not defensive.
I'm just asking a question.

1131
01:18:39,761 --> 01:18:42,514
I feel good. Do I look defensive to you?
Defenses are down.

1132
01:19:34,691 --> 01:19:36,068
I guess no one's home.

1133
01:19:39,321 --> 01:19:42,199
Uh, didn't you say, uh,
Christina had a darkroom?

1134
01:19:43,867 --> 01:19:47,246
Yeah, in the back,
but I doubt it's there now.

1135
01:19:48,747 --> 01:19:49,957
You want to check?

1136
01:22:19,314 --> 01:22:20,774
Two champagnes, please.

1137
01:22:20,858 --> 01:22:22,359
Two?
Okay, coming right up.

1138
01:22:26,655 --> 01:22:28,824
For you, ma'am.
Thank you.

1139
01:23:27,424 --> 01:23:28,800
We should move here.

1140
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:31,887
Or at least come back.

1141
01:23:35,557 --> 01:23:39,019
When are you going back to New York?
'Cause I have a show next Tuesday.

1142
01:23:41,939 --> 01:23:43,524
I've been meaning to tell you...

1143
01:23:44,608 --> 01:23:45,817
What?

1144
01:23:47,486 --> 01:23:48,779
I'm moving to London.

1145
01:23:49,363 --> 01:23:50,572
What?
Yeah, I...

1146
01:23:51,406 --> 01:23:52,699
I got the job.

1147
01:23:53,325 --> 01:23:54,368
When?

1148
01:23:56,703 --> 01:23:57,788
Could we just...

1149
01:24:03,168 --> 01:24:04,711
I just... I just found out.

1150
01:24:05,629 --> 01:24:08,423
Well, we were together all day.
Why didn't you say something?

1151
01:24:08,507 --> 01:24:11,260
I know. I just...
We were having a good time.

1152
01:24:11,343 --> 01:24:13,637
You know, I didn't want
to, uh, mess it up.

1153
01:24:15,472 --> 01:24:17,015
So, what do we do now?

1154
01:24:18,934 --> 01:24:21,144
I don't know. Figure it out.

1155
01:24:21,228 --> 01:24:22,896
How?
Well, I can go to...

1156
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:25,482
I can come to New York,
and you can come to London,

1157
01:24:25,566 --> 01:24:28,151
and we could go back and forth
and we figure it out.

1158
01:24:28,694 --> 01:24:29,695
It's not practical.

1159
01:24:29,778 --> 01:24:31,780
I know. I'm not trying
to be practical right now.

1160
01:24:31,864 --> 01:24:33,866
I want to be with you.

1161
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:36,952
Long distance never works.

1162
01:24:38,328 --> 01:24:39,997
What?
It never works.

1163
01:24:40,873 --> 01:24:43,292
Well, be optimistic. Come on.

1164
01:24:43,375 --> 01:24:46,253
I don't want to get together
just to break up.

1165
01:24:46,336 --> 01:24:48,172
I'm being honest.
Honest?

1166
01:24:48,255 --> 01:24:51,383
Yeah. I forgot,
you have trouble being honest.

1167
01:24:51,466 --> 01:24:53,403
Okay, uh, so what...
What is that supposed to mean?

1168
01:24:53,427 --> 01:24:56,471
Aren't you always searching
for something honest to say to a woman?

1169
01:24:57,931 --> 01:25:00,726
That's what I'm doing right now.
All right?

1170
01:25:00,809 --> 01:25:04,563
I'm being honest, and I'm saying
I want to try to be together.

1171
01:25:08,984 --> 01:25:11,361
Maybe we should just enjoy being here.

1172
01:25:48,190 --> 01:25:49,650
Michael still in town?

1173
01:25:49,733 --> 01:25:51,443
No, he left last night.

1174
01:25:52,277 --> 01:25:54,112
Why you didn't leave with him?

1175
01:25:54,696 --> 01:25:56,406
'Cause I wanted to stay longer.

1176
01:25:57,866 --> 01:25:59,785
I feel like that's not the whole story.

1177
01:26:00,827 --> 01:26:02,246
It's most of it.

1178
01:26:02,913 --> 01:26:04,665
I guess you more than look
like your mother.

1179
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:10,712
Yeah, I'm... probably more like her
than I'd like to be.

1180
01:26:12,089 --> 01:26:13,423
That's not a bad thing.

1181
01:26:14,591 --> 01:26:16,510
She was unwavering
in everything she wanted.

1182
01:26:17,469 --> 01:26:20,222
How could you say that, after everything?

1183
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,143
I don't blame her for leaving.

1184
01:26:27,312 --> 01:26:28,438
What did she say?

1185
01:26:29,773 --> 01:26:31,358
What did the letter say?

1186
01:26:33,026 --> 01:26:34,361
She apologized.

1187
01:26:37,948 --> 01:26:41,618
She kept you from me for so long,
she didn't know how to go back...

1188
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:44,663
how to tell me.

1189
01:26:50,878 --> 01:26:53,046
She asked me to take care of you.

1190
01:26:55,465 --> 01:26:57,092
I keep rereading mine.

1191
01:26:59,428 --> 01:27:03,307
She wrote over and over again, "My Mae."

1192
01:27:09,021 --> 01:27:10,898
I keep reading those two words...

1193
01:27:13,275 --> 01:27:15,569
like they're evidence that she loved me.

1194
01:27:19,531 --> 01:27:20,616
She did.

1195
01:27:22,034 --> 01:27:23,327
Very much.

1196
01:27:48,477 --> 01:27:50,229
"Y Mae,"

1197
01:27:50,312 --> 01:27:53,815
I didn't know how to love you except
by showing you the arc of a woman,

1198
01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:56,485
by being a good provider.

1199
01:28:04,785 --> 01:28:08,497
I put my love into work, my photographs.

1200
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:11,959
Pictures took space in my heart
instead of people.

1201
01:28:12,793 --> 01:28:14,753
It was the only way I could love.

1202
01:28:15,462 --> 01:28:18,841
I was stumbling through my own life,
trying not to break apart.

1203
01:28:19,675 --> 01:28:23,011
I wish I had put as much courage
into being your mother

1204
01:28:23,095 --> 01:28:25,097
as I was able to put in my work.

1205
01:29:39,671 --> 01:29:40,964
Evening, Mr. Morton.

1206
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:46,011
I told her to tell you about Isaac.

1207
01:29:46,887 --> 01:29:48,263
What did she say?

1208
01:29:48,347 --> 01:29:50,265
She made me promise never to tell you.

1209
01:29:51,016 --> 01:29:55,229
She thought it would just confuse you
and make his life harder, so I agreed.

1210
01:29:55,646 --> 01:30:00,025
Maybe I was wrong for that.
And if I am, I'm sorry.

1211
01:30:02,486 --> 01:30:05,280
When I first met her,
she was three months pregnant.

1212
01:30:05,697 --> 01:30:07,908
And that didn't bother you?
No.

1213
01:30:08,867 --> 01:30:10,452
I couldn't look away from her.

1214
01:30:11,662 --> 01:30:12,788
But she...

1215
01:30:13,997 --> 01:30:15,415
She turned me down at first.

1216
01:30:15,499 --> 01:30:18,210
Why?
She thought I felt sorry for her.

1217
01:30:18,293 --> 01:30:21,380
And she told me she didn't feel
the need to be an "honest woman."

1218
01:30:21,463 --> 01:30:24,758
But I know
she was just hung up on him.

1219
01:30:25,217 --> 01:30:27,052
So, why would she tell me now?

1220
01:30:27,845 --> 01:30:29,805
Maybe it was her way of explaining...

1221
01:30:31,056 --> 01:30:32,349
Explaining what?

1222
01:30:32,432 --> 01:30:34,017
Why she was the way she was.

1223
01:30:35,227 --> 01:30:38,021
And why she was never very good at...

1224
01:30:39,648 --> 01:30:40,816
being your mother.

1225
01:30:44,945 --> 01:30:48,699
Do you remember when you were leaving
for Chicago, for school?

1226
01:30:50,409 --> 01:30:55,998
Yeah. Mom didn't come to the airport
'cause she said she had to meet somebody.

1227
01:30:56,832 --> 01:31:01,086
Like I wasn't moving across the country.
Like I wasn't more important.

1228
01:31:01,628 --> 01:31:02,921
She didn't have to meet anyone.

1229
01:31:04,923 --> 01:31:08,093
When I came home, she was sitting
in the back of the house, crying.

1230
01:31:10,596 --> 01:31:13,098
Your mother wasn't very good at goodbyes.

1231
01:31:17,978 --> 01:31:21,273
I'm not a sentimental person,
as many of you know.

1232
01:31:21,356 --> 01:31:24,359
I don't like getting attached to people.
It makes it harder to fire them.

1233
01:31:25,527 --> 01:31:28,572
And it makes it that much more
annoying when they abandon you.

1234
01:31:29,031 --> 01:31:30,657
I'm not abandoning you.

1235
01:31:30,741 --> 01:31:32,621
He's leaving,
and he thinks he's better than us.

1236
01:31:34,411 --> 01:31:36,371
Well, let's all pretend to wish him luck.

1237
01:31:36,955 --> 01:31:38,725
Good luck, Michael.

1238
01:31:38,749 --> 01:31:39,750
Thank you.

1239
01:31:49,468 --> 01:31:51,929
We got more negatives
from Billy Wasko's archives

1240
01:31:52,012 --> 01:31:53,514
for Christina's retrospective.

1241
01:31:53,847 --> 01:31:54,973
Thanks.

1242
01:31:56,642 --> 01:31:57,643
Are you heading out?

1243
01:31:57,726 --> 01:32:00,020
Yeah. Dinner with Andy.

1244
01:32:02,856 --> 01:32:04,691
I'm uncomfortable with how happy you are.

1245
01:32:04,775 --> 01:32:06,151
How do you think I feel?

1246
01:32:06,235 --> 01:32:10,405
Being unhappy and jaded,
it's comfortable, but...

1247
01:32:11,365 --> 01:32:12,407
But?

1248
01:32:13,784 --> 01:32:18,872
I like him, and,
maybe I'm not who I thought I was.

1249
01:32:18,956 --> 01:32:20,707
Maybe I'm different with him.

1250
01:32:21,166 --> 01:32:23,544
So, you're choosing to be
a different person?

1251
01:32:25,087 --> 01:32:28,006
I don't know.
I'm just choosing to be with him.

1252
01:32:31,844 --> 01:32:33,220
What about you?

1253
01:32:34,221 --> 01:32:35,556
I think I messed that up.

1254
01:32:37,599 --> 01:32:41,603
It's like I said the opposite
of everything that I wanted to say to him.

1255
01:32:43,730 --> 01:32:45,357
Well, what did you want to say?

1256
01:32:47,192 --> 01:32:48,861
That I wanted him to stay.

1257
01:32:52,573 --> 01:32:53,907
Can you still tell him that?

1258
01:32:55,784 --> 01:32:56,994
I don't know. I...

1259
01:32:58,871 --> 01:33:00,664
He looked at me
like he was so disappointed.

1260
01:33:01,748 --> 01:33:05,919
I don't know, I felt like I couldn't
ask him to rearrange his life for me.

1261
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:10,757
It's too late. It's... Whatever.

1262
01:33:13,385 --> 01:33:15,137
Have you selected the final photos?

1263
01:33:15,470 --> 01:33:16,680
Uh, almost.

1264
01:33:17,848 --> 01:33:20,184
I'm just gonna go through
the rest of her archives

1265
01:33:20,267 --> 01:33:22,728
and see if there's anything else
I want to show.

1266
01:33:23,353 --> 01:33:24,354
Okay.

1267
01:33:24,438 --> 01:33:25,439
Bye.

1268
01:33:50,547 --> 01:33:52,257
Yo.
Yo.

1269
01:33:52,966 --> 01:33:53,967
What's up?

1270
01:33:54,927 --> 01:33:56,970
So, uh, did Sara tell you?

1271
01:33:57,179 --> 01:33:58,430
What?

1272
01:33:59,306 --> 01:34:02,392
I'm not an intern anymore.
I'm a paid employee.

1273
01:34:02,976 --> 01:34:04,186
Boom.
Boom.

1274
01:34:04,269 --> 01:34:06,438
Oh, congratulations. Wow.

1275
01:34:06,855 --> 01:34:08,106
Did you tell her to promote me?

1276
01:34:08,190 --> 01:34:09,399
No.
Hmm.

1277
01:34:09,483 --> 01:34:11,318
Thank you.

1278
01:34:11,401 --> 01:34:12,486
Whatever, man.

1279
01:34:15,364 --> 01:34:17,533
Um, I'm gonna miss you, man.

1280
01:34:18,325 --> 01:34:19,701
Oh, man, don't miss me.

1281
01:34:22,287 --> 01:34:23,705
Oh, all right.

1282
01:34:25,123 --> 01:34:27,042
All right.

1283
01:34:29,878 --> 01:34:32,297
I read your, um, article
on Pointe à la Hache.

1284
01:34:32,923 --> 01:34:35,133
What'd you think?
It was personal.

1285
01:34:35,217 --> 01:34:36,260
I know.

1286
01:34:36,885 --> 01:34:41,682
Probably too personal.
It became all about me and my stuff.

1287
01:34:42,766 --> 01:34:44,518
It's not often you meet someone like that.

1288
01:34:44,601 --> 01:34:47,563
Yeah, I know. Christina and Isaac, man,
that's an anomaly.

1289
01:34:47,646 --> 01:34:49,106
I'm talking about Mae.

1290
01:34:53,986 --> 01:34:56,196
The office is gonna be bleak
without you, man.

1291
01:35:24,057 --> 01:35:25,577
Do you miss Louisiana?

1292
01:35:27,269 --> 01:35:28,580
Parts of it.

1293
01:35:28,604 --> 01:35:32,149
Hmm. What parts?
The good parts.

1294
01:35:34,026 --> 01:35:36,153
And what do you like
about New York?

1295
01:35:36,987 --> 01:35:38,447
I like my work.

1296
01:35:42,409 --> 01:35:43,660
What are you thinking?

1297
01:35:45,287 --> 01:35:50,250
That I wish I was as good at love
as I am at working.

1298
01:36:08,393 --> 01:36:10,979
I wish I didn't leave people behind
so often.

1299
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:58,819
Mr. Williams.

1300
01:37:04,116 --> 01:37:05,284
Michael Block?

1301
01:37:05,951 --> 01:37:07,035
Yeah.

1302
01:37:52,539 --> 01:37:53,624
Sorry, bro.

1303
01:37:55,250 --> 01:37:57,085
Want tickets
to Kendrick Lamar, anyone?

1304
01:38:13,727 --> 01:38:16,230
Hey.
Hey.

1305
01:38:18,190 --> 01:38:20,484
I just really felt like seeing Kendrick.

1306
01:38:22,069 --> 01:38:23,904
No, you didn't.

1307
01:38:24,571 --> 01:38:27,407
I guess I'm lucky that, you know,
he was performing here tonight.

1308
01:38:29,409 --> 01:38:31,328
And I really wanted to see you.

1309
01:38:32,329 --> 01:38:34,164
I've been wanting to see you, too.

1310
01:38:36,792 --> 01:38:40,420
I'm sorry for not knowing
what to say before you left.

1311
01:38:40,504 --> 01:38:43,507
I just didn't know
how to tell you how I felt.

1312
01:38:44,716 --> 01:38:49,179
And I think I'm not used
to needing anyone.

1313
01:38:49,930 --> 01:38:51,265
Yeah. I get that.

1314
01:38:52,933 --> 01:38:54,268
But I need you.

1315
01:38:55,394 --> 01:38:57,479
And I don't care where you live.

1316
01:38:57,563 --> 01:39:00,566
I just want to be close to you
as much as possible.

1317
01:39:01,024 --> 01:39:04,653
I don't want to be practical.
I want to figure it out.

1318
01:39:06,488 --> 01:39:09,783
And I don't want so much time to pass
that we can't come back.

1319
01:39:09,867 --> 01:39:11,952
Yeah.
And I... I don't want...

1320
01:39:24,256 --> 01:39:26,175
You know, we will always come back.

1321
01:39:28,051 --> 01:39:29,261
Really?

1322
01:39:31,138 --> 01:39:32,264
You know that.

1323
01:39:36,602 --> 01:39:38,020
How's London?

1324
01:39:38,562 --> 01:39:40,564
Uh, I've just been out here
being pathetic,

1325
01:39:40,647 --> 01:39:42,024
thinking about you.

1326
01:39:42,107 --> 01:39:43,525
That's good.

1327
01:39:59,249 --> 01:40:01,251
You want to go hear some music?

1328
01:40:02,044 --> 01:40:03,253
Yeah.
Come on.

1329
01:40:10,052 --> 01:40:11,892
We have a show to see!

1330
01:40:34,618 --> 01:40:36,286
Set the tone.

1331
01:40:36,620 --> 01:40:38,080
When it's just me.

1332
01:40:38,163 --> 01:40:41,458
And you alone, never lonely.

1333
01:40:41,792 --> 01:40:45,170
In the room, breathing slowly.

1334
01:40:45,254 --> 01:40:48,549
Oh, you know me, yeah.

1335
01:40:48,632 --> 01:40:51,802
Meditate, you can take me.

1336
01:40:52,135 --> 01:40:53,762
To a place.

1337
01:40:53,846 --> 01:40:56,932
Where we can be all alone

1338
01:40:57,015 --> 01:40:58,976
I let you hold me

1339
01:40:59,059 --> 01:41:00,936
'Cause you know me.

1340
01:41:01,019 --> 01:41:03,146
Me, yeah.

1341
01:41:05,399 --> 01:41:09,361
Lay your head on my pillow
Say ooh-ooh.

1342
01:41:12,239 --> 01:41:16,827
Touch is making me feel a way, ooh-ooh.

1343
01:41:19,162 --> 01:41:21,123
Whenever I get around you

1344
01:41:21,206 --> 01:41:23,709
I lose it.

1345
01:41:25,169 --> 01:41:27,171
Lose it

1346
01:41:27,254 --> 01:41:28,589
'Cause I feel.

1347
01:41:28,672 --> 01:41:32,384
So comfortable with you.

1348
01:41:34,386 --> 01:41:36,096
You make me.

1349
01:41:36,180 --> 01:41:39,224
Comfortable with you.

1350
01:41:39,850 --> 01:41:41,268
Hmm.

1351
01:41:41,351 --> 01:41:43,395
You make me.

1352
01:41:43,812 --> 01:41:45,522
Wanna get Wanna get.

1353
01:41:45,606 --> 01:41:47,191
Wanna go deep Go.

1354
01:41:47,274 --> 01:41:48,901
Intimate Intimate.

1355
01:41:48,984 --> 01:41:50,611
Let you in me.

1356
01:41:50,694 --> 01:41:52,154
Inside Inside.

1357
01:41:52,237 --> 01:41:53,989
You deserve it.

1358
01:41:54,072 --> 01:41:55,782
On my mind.

1359
01:41:55,866 --> 01:41:58,327
My mind, yeah.

1360
01:41:58,410 --> 01:42:00,078
Yeah.

1361
01:42:00,537 --> 01:42:04,458
Lay your head on my pillow
Say ooh-ooh.

1362
01:42:04,541 --> 01:42:05,667
Touching.

1363
01:42:07,419 --> 01:42:10,047
Way you're touching,
know it's okay with.

1364
01:42:10,130 --> 01:42:11,757
Ooh-ooh.

1365
01:42:14,301 --> 01:42:16,261
When I get around you

1366
01:42:16,345 --> 01:42:18,931
I just lose it.

1367
01:42:20,474 --> 01:42:22,392
Lose it

1368
01:42:22,476 --> 01:42:27,564
'Cause I feel so comfortable with you.

1369
01:42:29,441 --> 01:42:34,238
You make me comfortable with you.

1370
01:42:34,321 --> 01:42:36,657
With you Mmm.

1371
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:38,450
You make me.

1372
01:42:39,326 --> 01:42:40,702
Baby.

1373
01:42:41,954 --> 01:42:46,500
Lay your head on my pillow
Say ooh-ooh.

1374
01:42:48,877 --> 01:42:53,841
Way you're touching my body
Say ooh-ooh-ooh.

1375
01:42:55,634 --> 01:42:59,721
I ain't loving nobody but you.

1376
01:43:01,682 --> 01:43:03,642
You.

1377
01:43:03,725 --> 01:43:05,644
You make me 'Cause I feel so.

1378
01:43:05,727 --> 01:43:09,106
Comfortable with you.

1379
01:43:09,189 --> 01:43:10,732

01:43:10,816 --> 01:43:15,612
I feel so comfortable with you.

You make me.
