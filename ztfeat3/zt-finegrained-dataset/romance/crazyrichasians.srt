2
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:00,077
Be careful, your fingers.

3
00:01:19,864 --> 00:01:21,562
May I help you?

4
00:01:21,564 --> 00:01:25,800
This is the Calthorpe.
Private hotel.

5
00:01:25,802 --> 00:01:28,003
I'm Mrs. Eleanor Young.

6
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:31,439
I have a reservation
at the Lancaster Suite.

7
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:35,144
We spoke on the phone
when I confirmed yesterday.

8
00:01:35,146 --> 00:01:38,680
Sorry, don't seem to have
your reservation.

9
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,716
Good evening.

10
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:43,584
I'm Reginald Ormsby,

11
00:01:43,586 --> 00:01:45,820
hotel manager.
Is there a problem?

12
00:01:45,822 --> 00:01:47,789
I'm Mrs. Eleanor Young.

13
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:51,360
My family and I would like
to be shown to our suite.

14
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:53,095
We've had a long flight.

15
00:01:53,097 --> 00:01:56,865
We're fully booked, madam.
You must have made a mistake.

16
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,633
I'm sure
you and your lovely family

17
00:01:58,635 --> 00:02:00,869
can find other accommodation.

18
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:04,406
May I suggest
you explore Chinatown?

19
00:02:10,915 --> 00:02:13,916
Please, may I use
your phone to call my husband?

20
00:02:13,918 --> 00:02:16,486
It's the least you can do.

21
00:02:16,954 --> 00:02:18,287
Mmm.

22
00:02:25,262 --> 00:02:27,729
Mrs. Young,
I must ask you to leave

23
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:28,931
or I'll have to call
the police.

24
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:30,866
Please, go right ahead.

25
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,804
Lord Calthorpe, my apologies
for the disturbance.

26
00:02:36,806 --> 00:02:41,776
Eleanor! I just got off
the phone with your husband.

27
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:44,514
Get the Lancaster Suite ready.
Now.

28
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,449
Surely you're joking, sir.

29
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:49,617
I assure you, I'm not.

30
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:51,387
As of this evening,

31
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:53,688
my family's long history

32
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,960
as custodians
of the Calthorpe is ended.

33
00:02:57,962 --> 00:03:01,063
I'm selling the hotel
to my dear friends,

34
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:03,564
the Young family of Singapore.

35
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:07,668
Meet the new lady
of the house,

36
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,240
Eleanor Young.

37
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,408
Join me for a toast.

38
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,078
We'd be delighted.

39
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:21,085
Do get a mop. The floor's wet.

40
00:03:27,525 --> 00:03:29,226
Get a mop.

41
00:04:01,358 --> 00:04:03,626
I'm all in.

42
00:04:12,103 --> 00:04:14,269
Fold.

43
00:04:14,271 --> 00:04:15,703
Oh...

44
00:04:15,705 --> 00:04:16,872
Nothing?

45
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,277
This whole time
you had nothing?

46
00:04:21,245 --> 00:04:22,511
All right, so

47
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:26,548
how did I beat T.A. Curtis
so very, very badly?

48
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,952
Well, I know for a fact
that Curtis is cheap.

49
00:04:31,322 --> 00:04:34,523
So he's not playing
using logic or math,

50
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:36,358
but using his psychology.

51
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,894
Our brains so hate the idea

52
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:40,429
of losing something
that's valuable to us

53
00:04:40,431 --> 00:04:42,131
that we abandon
all rational thought,

54
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:43,899
and we make some really
poor decisions.

55
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:45,833
So, Curtis wasn't playing
to win.

56
00:04:45,835 --> 00:04:47,870
He was playing not to lose.

57
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:50,771
Here.
Put it towards a haircut.

58
00:04:51,976 --> 00:04:53,976
All right,
that's it for today.

59
00:04:53,978 --> 00:04:56,545
Don't forget your essays
on conditional probability

60
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:58,413
are due next week.

61
00:05:08,425 --> 00:05:10,092
Yes! Mmm-hmm.

62
00:05:10,094 --> 00:05:12,227
You know what?
You can order your own.

63
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,329
Mmm. I'm okay with coffee.
Thanks.

64
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:16,198
Yeah, well,
you always say that,

65
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,133
and then you end up eating
all my dessert.

66
00:05:18,135 --> 00:05:19,334
I don't know
what you're talking about.

67
00:05:19,336 --> 00:05:21,470
'Cause I have, like,
a tiny bit.

68
00:05:21,472 --> 00:05:22,938
Uh-huh. Okay.
Can we have one more

69
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,674
of these, please? Thank you.

70
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,146
So what about us
taking an adventure east?

71
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:35,184
You wanna get pork buns
in the East Village.

72
00:05:35,186 --> 00:05:36,585
That's what it is, isn't it?

73
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:41,657
I was actually thinking
of further east.

74
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:43,992
Like Queens?

75
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:46,727
Like Singapore.
For spring break.

76
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:48,197
Colin's wedding.

77
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,998
We've been dating
for over a year now,

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,200
and I think it's about time

79
00:05:51,202 --> 00:05:53,001
people met
my beautiful girlfriend.

80
00:05:53,003 --> 00:05:55,703
Come on, I'm Colin's best man.

81
00:05:55,705 --> 00:05:57,539
Don't you wanna see
where I grew up?

82
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,008
Meet my family, my Ah Ma?

83
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,544
And meet up with that strange
college roommate of yours.

84
00:06:02,546 --> 00:06:03,912
Peik Lin.

85
00:06:03,914 --> 00:06:05,480
Mmm-hmm. Peik Lin.
She has been begging me

86
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:06,847
to come visit her, you know.

87
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:09,853
The universe has spoken.
It wants you over there.

88
00:06:10,888 --> 00:06:12,521
Come to Singapore.

89
00:06:12,523 --> 00:06:15,893
I want the whole island to
meet the brilliant Rachel Chu.

90
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,760
Aww.

91
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,971
"If then you have
been raised with Christ,

92
00:07:37,107 --> 00:07:38,806
"seek the things
that are above

93
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:40,709
"where Christ is seated

94
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:44,079
"at the right hand of God.

95
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:47,049
"Set your minds
on things that are above,

96
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:50,052
"not on things
that are on Earth."

97
00:07:50,054 --> 00:07:52,020
Eleanor,
is Nicki bringing a girl

98
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:53,522
to Colin's wedding?

99
00:07:53,524 --> 00:07:56,024
My Amanda heard it
from her friend Francesca.

100
00:07:56,026 --> 00:07:58,560
Eddie says
her name is Rachel Chu.

101
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:01,229
Oh, I thought that
Nick was coming alone.

102
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,432
Did you know
he had a girlfriend?

103
00:08:03,434 --> 00:08:07,135
Nick dates many girls.
It's hard to keep track.

104
00:08:07,137 --> 00:08:08,836
Amanda knows everyone

105
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:10,906
and she has never heard
of her.

106
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:12,474
Rachel Chu.

107
00:08:12,476 --> 00:08:15,644
Maybe she's from the Taiwan
plastics Chu family.

108
00:08:15,646 --> 00:08:18,714
If you want,
I have a private investigator.

109
00:08:18,716 --> 00:08:20,148
Very discreet.

110
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:23,187
I think we should return
to the word of God.

111
00:08:24,521 --> 00:08:25,589
Alix.

112
00:08:26,957 --> 00:08:29,624
Ephesians.
Chapter six, verse four.

113
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:32,160
"Bring up your children
in the discipline

114
00:08:32,162 --> 00:08:33,562
"and instruction of the Lord."

115
00:08:33,564 --> 00:08:35,230
Oh, I do hope
she's a good Christian girl.

116
00:08:35,232 --> 00:08:36,531
Well,
if he's bringing her home,

117
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:37,799
it must be serious.

118
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:39,036
Exactly.

119
00:08:43,407 --> 00:08:45,207
Oh.

120
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:47,542
It's my mum. Do you mind?
Mmm. Go ahead.

121
00:08:47,544 --> 00:08:48,510
All right.

122
00:08:48,512 --> 00:08:50,280
Save me some of that.
Okay.

123
00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:54,015
Hey, Mum,
everything okay?

124
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:57,052
Does something have
to be wrong for me to call?

125
00:08:57,054 --> 00:08:59,321
Yeah, usually.

126
00:08:59,323 --> 00:09:01,390
Very funny.

127
00:09:01,392 --> 00:09:03,125
Are you bringing
the girl you're seeing

128
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:05,093
to Colin's wedding?

129
00:09:05,095 --> 00:09:08,196
Mmm. We were literally
just talking about that.

130
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:09,931
How could you know?

131
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:11,870
Everybody knows.

132
00:09:17,574 --> 00:09:19,474
Radio One Asia.

133
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,477
Move on to Corinthians.
I'll catch up.

134
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,678
Oh, yes.

135
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,214
We're looking forward
to having you home.

136
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:29,684
And your room
is all ready for you.

137
00:09:29,686 --> 00:09:31,286
Thanks, Mum.

138
00:09:31,288 --> 00:09:33,722
But Rachel and I will be
staying together.

139
00:09:33,724 --> 00:09:35,056
I see.

140
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:37,292
Well, I'm having
the house re-done.

141
00:09:37,294 --> 00:09:39,227
And it's not ready for guests.

142
00:09:39,229 --> 00:09:41,696
If Rachel comes, I think
she might be more comfortable

143
00:09:41,698 --> 00:09:43,567
staying somewhere else.

144
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:47,269
All right, sorry about that.

145
00:09:47,271 --> 00:09:48,670
I saved you a piece.

146
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,173
You did, did you?
A very small piece at that.

147
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:53,108
Thank you very much.

148
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:56,011
How's your mom?
Everything okay?

149
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,680
Couldn't be better.

150
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:00,715
Hey, Mom, this one's kind of
cute. What do you think?

151
00:10:00,717 --> 00:10:04,486
No, no! You can't wear that
to meet Nick's Ah Ma.

152
00:10:04,488 --> 00:10:06,955
Blue and white
is for Chinese funerals.

153
00:10:06,957 --> 00:10:11,760
Now this, this symbolizes
good fortune and fertility.

154
00:10:11,762 --> 00:10:15,497
Great! I was really going for
that "lucky baby maker" vibe.

155
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:17,399
Hey! You're the one
who asked for my help

156
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:19,000
picking out a dress
to meet Nick's family.

157
00:10:19,002 --> 00:10:21,536
It's only 'cause I hardly know
anything about them.

158
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,839
Every time I bring them up,
Nick changes the subject.

159
00:10:23,841 --> 00:10:25,507
Maybe he's embarrassed.

160
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:27,709
Maybe his parents are poor,
and he has to send them money.

161
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,045
That's what
all good Chinese children do.

162
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:31,813
Oh, you're going to have

163
00:10:31,815 --> 00:10:33,348
a wonderful time.

164
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,484
You've always wanted
to go to Asia.

165
00:10:35,486 --> 00:10:38,386
And who knows, if all
goes well in Singapore,

166
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,622
you might just come back
with a souvenir.

167
00:10:40,624 --> 00:10:42,557
Oh, Mom, stop!

168
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,559
Nick and I haven't
even talked about that.

169
00:10:46,597 --> 00:10:49,566
I mean, his parents
can't not like me, right?

170
00:10:51,635 --> 00:10:53,802
What was that look?
I saw that.

171
00:10:53,804 --> 00:10:55,972
Nothing. It's just,

172
00:10:55,974 --> 00:10:57,940
Nick bringing a girl
all the way there

173
00:10:57,942 --> 00:10:59,474
to meet them can mean a lot

174
00:10:59,476 --> 00:11:01,643
to these overseas families.
They're different from us.

175
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:05,447
How are they different?
They're Chinese, I'm Chinese.

176
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:07,984
I'm so Chinese,
I'm an economics professor

177
00:11:07,986 --> 00:11:09,852
with lactose intolerance.

178
00:11:09,854 --> 00:11:12,189
Yeah, but you grew up here.

179
00:11:19,864 --> 00:11:21,331
You're different.

180
00:11:22,332 --> 00:11:23,933
But wearing a lucky color

181
00:11:23,935 --> 00:11:27,003
will make
a good first impression.

182
00:11:32,643 --> 00:11:34,209
Okay, game plan.

183
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:36,244
Check our bags,
get through security,

184
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:38,179
and then we could eat
one of the three homemade

185
00:11:38,181 --> 00:11:40,382
Tupperware meals
my mom packed for us.

186
00:11:40,384 --> 00:11:42,050
Good afternoon, Mr. Young,
Miss Chu.

187
00:11:42,052 --> 00:11:44,185
We'll take your bags and get
you checked into first class.

188
00:11:44,187 --> 00:11:46,254
Great.
Oh. No, there's a mistake.

189
00:11:46,256 --> 00:11:49,090
We're not first class.
We're economy people.

190
00:11:49,092 --> 00:11:50,258
This way, please.

191
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,661
Just go with it. Come on.

192
00:11:52,663 --> 00:11:53,896
But...

193
00:11:53,898 --> 00:11:56,300
Yeah, they'll be fine.
Just leave them there.

194
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:02,137
Welcome aboard,
Mr. Young, Miss Chu.

195
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,174
Here's the way
to your private suite.

196
00:12:05,242 --> 00:12:07,208
And some champagne.

197
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,248
Thank you.

198
00:12:14,418 --> 00:12:16,886
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.

199
00:12:16,888 --> 00:12:19,554
After takeoff, would you like
to enjoy the lounge chairs,

200
00:12:19,556 --> 00:12:21,323
or should we convert
your suite into a bedroom?

201
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:24,125
Uh... We're good. Thank you.

202
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:25,362
Enjoy.

203
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:29,466
Nick. We can't afford this.
Mmm.

204
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,737
These pajamas are fancier
than any of my real clothes.

205
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:37,472
My family has business
with the airline.

206
00:12:37,474 --> 00:12:40,243
The tickets, they're a perk.

207
00:12:43,081 --> 00:12:44,679
What kind of business?

208
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,382
Real estate, investment,
other things.

209
00:12:47,384 --> 00:12:48,817
Nothing interesting.

210
00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:49,820
"Dim sum."

211
00:12:52,623 --> 00:12:56,892
So your family is, like, rich?

212
00:12:56,894 --> 00:12:58,760
We're comfortable.

213
00:12:58,762 --> 00:13:02,399
That is exactly what
a super-rich person would say.

214
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,601
It's not a big deal,
obviously.

215
00:13:06,603 --> 00:13:10,739
I just think it's kind of
weird that I had no idea.

216
00:13:10,741 --> 00:13:13,009
I mean,
you have a Jamba Juice card.

217
00:13:13,011 --> 00:13:14,944
You use my Netflix password.

218
00:13:14,946 --> 00:13:17,579
You play basketball at that Y
that kind of smells.

219
00:13:17,581 --> 00:13:19,816
I really like that place,
thank you very much.

220
00:13:21,119 --> 00:13:23,218
And yes, my family has money,

221
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,087
but I've always
thought of it as theirs.

222
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:26,454
Not mine.

223
00:13:26,456 --> 00:13:28,189
I get that.
But I'm going all the way

224
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,859
over there to meet them...

225
00:13:29,861 --> 00:13:32,327
Kind of just wanna know
what I'm getting into.

226
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:34,964
And, you know,
they're your family.

227
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:36,667
Well...

228
00:13:38,435 --> 00:13:40,201
My family is much like
anybody else's.

229
00:13:40,203 --> 00:13:41,670
Mmm-hmm.

230
00:13:41,672 --> 00:13:43,605
There's half of them
that you love and respect,

231
00:13:43,607 --> 00:13:45,975
and then
there's the other half.

232
00:13:45,977 --> 00:13:47,477
Which half am I meeting?

233
00:13:50,647 --> 00:13:52,280
Well,
there's my cousin Alistair,

234
00:13:52,282 --> 00:13:54,182
based in Taiwan,
works in movies.

235
00:13:56,154 --> 00:13:57,752
And cut!

236
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:01,589
He's dating Kitty Pong,
an actress.

237
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:02,860
Kitty.
Alistair.

238
00:14:04,528 --> 00:14:07,762
You like it?
I was feeling very,

239
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:11,332
very the emotions.
Can you feel it?

240
00:14:11,334 --> 00:14:14,604
Oh, I can feel all of you.
And all of me.

241
00:14:27,718 --> 00:14:29,250
Okay, and what
about your cousin Eddie?

242
00:14:29,252 --> 00:14:30,652
You don't ever talk about him.

243
00:14:30,654 --> 00:14:33,189
Well, Eddie's a big
finance guy in Hong Kong.

244
00:14:33,191 --> 00:14:34,524
A real family man.

245
00:14:38,162 --> 00:14:39,294
You know,
if you move,

246
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:40,662
it will look more natural.

247
00:14:40,664 --> 00:14:43,298
No, this way you get
our optimal angles.

248
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,300
Then we're done.

249
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:48,503
Russell, thank you so much.

250
00:14:48,505 --> 00:14:50,271
It's an honor
to be photographed by you.

251
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:52,041
My pleasure.
People will love it

252
00:14:52,043 --> 00:14:53,876
in the next Hong Kong Vogue.

253
00:14:53,878 --> 00:14:56,178
Thank you, Russell.

254
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,215
Hong Kong Vogue? I knew it.
Your dress is a disaster.

255
00:14:59,217 --> 00:15:01,217
If you wore a Bottega gown,
like I told you to,

256
00:15:01,219 --> 00:15:02,484
we'd be in the American Vogue.

257
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:04,519
You can wear
that gown to Hell, Eddie.

258
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:06,454
Stop!

259
00:15:06,456 --> 00:15:07,655
Then there's Astrid.

260
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,724
Ah. I remember Astrid.

261
00:15:09,726 --> 00:15:11,861
She's like who I wanna be
when I grow up.

262
00:15:11,863 --> 00:15:13,528
Astrid is awesome.

263
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:14,596
And she's probably
the only one

264
00:15:14,598 --> 00:15:15,898
I'm actually close with.

265
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,532
And she's really grounded
and down to earth,

266
00:15:17,534 --> 00:15:19,369
once you get to know her.

267
00:15:26,177 --> 00:15:29,011
Not only did she graduate
top of her class at Oxford,

268
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:32,214
start multiple charities,
and is a fashion icon,

269
00:15:32,216 --> 00:15:35,719
Astrid has the biggest heart
of any of my cousins.

270
00:15:37,255 --> 00:15:39,155
Mummy? See what I made
for bunny?

271
00:15:39,157 --> 00:15:40,423
No, not now.

272
00:15:45,796 --> 00:15:49,798
Hi, I'm Astrid.
What's your name?

273
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,966
Vita.

274
00:15:50,968 --> 00:15:52,502
And who's this?

275
00:15:52,937 --> 00:15:54,270
Bun-Bun.

276
00:15:54,272 --> 00:15:58,140
Well, I think Bun-Bun looks
very dashing with his bow.

277
00:15:58,142 --> 00:15:59,374
You have a good eye.

278
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:00,675
Thank you.

279
00:16:00,677 --> 00:16:02,878
Miss Leong, right this way.

280
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,581
It's very nice
to meet you both.

281
00:16:14,225 --> 00:16:16,892
These are all
brand-new from Antwerp.

282
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:20,062
You're the first person
I've shown them to.

283
00:16:24,268 --> 00:16:25,602
What are those?

284
00:16:27,271 --> 00:16:28,873
Those?

285
00:16:31,175 --> 00:16:33,608
Those are very special.

286
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,911
Burmese pearl drop earrings.

287
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:40,615
Set with emeralds, and rare
pigeon blood-red rubies.

288
00:16:40,617 --> 00:16:43,185
They were worn
by Queen Supayalat

289
00:16:43,187 --> 00:16:47,357
at her self-anointed
coronation in 1878.

290
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,725
How much?

291
00:16:50,727 --> 00:16:53,528
Having you wear
one of my pieces

292
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:56,631
is better publicity
than I can buy.

293
00:16:56,633 --> 00:17:00,972
I'll let them go at cost.
1.2 million.

294
00:17:05,009 --> 00:17:07,309
So if you have
all this family there,

295
00:17:07,311 --> 00:17:09,444
why are we staying in a hotel?

296
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:11,446
Aren't good Chinese sons

297
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:14,316
supposed to stay
with their parents?

298
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:19,088
Well, because A,
I'm not that good a son.

299
00:17:20,523 --> 00:17:21,725
And B,

300
00:17:24,195 --> 00:17:27,131
I just want you to myself,
just for a bit.

301
00:17:27,899 --> 00:17:28,966
That okay?

302
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,436
Okay.

303
00:18:09,706 --> 00:18:13,309
God, I can't believe this
airport has a butterfly garden

304
00:18:13,311 --> 00:18:15,476
and a movie theater.

305
00:18:15,478 --> 00:18:18,613
JFK is just salmonella
and despair.

306
00:18:18,615 --> 00:18:21,183
Nick! Nick!

307
00:18:28,392 --> 00:18:29,726
Araminta!

308
00:18:31,963 --> 00:18:33,728
I missed you.
I missed you, too.

309
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,230
Rachel.
Hi.

310
00:18:35,232 --> 00:18:36,464
There he is.

311
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:37,933
It's so nice
to finally meet you.

312
00:18:37,935 --> 00:18:39,834
It's so nice to meet you, too.

313
00:18:39,836 --> 00:18:42,004
Nicki-Nick!
It's been too long, brother.

314
00:18:42,006 --> 00:18:44,639
It has been too long.
Welcome back.

315
00:18:44,641 --> 00:18:45,807
You guys didn't have to
pick us up.

316
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:47,409
Of course we did. We had to.

317
00:18:47,411 --> 00:18:49,878
Of course I had to come
welcome my best man properly.

318
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,447
Hi, Rachel.
Hello.

319
00:18:51,449 --> 00:18:52,847
Oh! Lovely to finally
meet you.

320
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:54,083
Nice to meet you, too.

321
00:18:54,085 --> 00:18:55,284
Shall we?
Let me help you with this.

322
00:18:55,286 --> 00:18:56,551
Yes.

323
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:57,987
These are for you.
I can grab these.

324
00:18:57,989 --> 00:18:59,487
I know
they're a bit over-the-top.

325
00:18:59,489 --> 00:19:00,990
Let's get
you guys localized.

326
00:19:00,992 --> 00:19:02,391
Are you hungry?
I'm always hungry.

327
00:19:02,393 --> 00:19:05,493
So let's eat
everything we can.

328
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:25,981
Welcome to
heaven on earth!

329
00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:28,853
I hope you're hungry.
I am bloody starving.

330
00:19:35,725 --> 00:19:38,659
Guys! Here! Whoo!

331
00:19:38,661 --> 00:19:41,030
Come with me.

332
00:19:41,032 --> 00:19:42,331
Each of these
hawker stalls

333
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,731
sells pretty much one dish,

334
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:46,035
and they've been perfecting it
for generations.

335
00:19:46,037 --> 00:19:48,103
You know, this is one of
the only places in the world

336
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:51,140
where street food vendors
actually earn Michelin stars.

337
00:19:51,142 --> 00:19:52,975
Hey! How are you?
Uncle.

338
00:19:52,977 --> 00:19:54,809
Long time no see, my friend.

339
00:19:54,811 --> 00:19:57,413
Here you go.
Thank you very much, sir.

340
00:19:57,415 --> 00:20:00,416
Look at this. Look at this.
My favorite.

341
00:20:04,055 --> 00:20:05,187
Hmm.

342
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:11,493
One of those for you.

343
00:20:11,495 --> 00:20:12,560
Yes, thank you.

344
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,734
Looks a little vomity.

345
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,277
Oh, my God!
Yes?

346
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:30,645
I told you. Best satay
on the island for sure.

347
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:31,880
So yummy, isn't it?

348
00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:33,849
All right, dig in, guys. Oh.

349
00:20:33,851 --> 00:20:35,783
Before I forget,
I need your help tomorrow.

350
00:20:35,785 --> 00:20:37,219
I need to do
some groomsmen stuff,

351
00:20:37,221 --> 00:20:39,221
and I don't wanna do it alone
with Bernard Tai.

352
00:20:39,223 --> 00:20:40,621
I still cannot believe
that you got

353
00:20:40,623 --> 00:20:42,124
that guy to be your groomsman.

354
00:20:42,126 --> 00:20:43,559
Thank you. Thank you.
I rest my case.

355
00:20:43,561 --> 00:20:45,094
Minty...

356
00:20:45,096 --> 00:20:48,097
Well, it wasn't up to me,
was it? It's not my choice.

357
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:50,065
Bernard is
the human douche nozzle

358
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:52,800
who used to steal my tuck shop
money when we were kids.

359
00:20:52,802 --> 00:20:54,669
Until Nicki-Nick beat him up.

360
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,472
Well...
You beat somebody up?

361
00:20:56,474 --> 00:20:57,873
I threw a single punch.

362
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,209
I fell on the floor
and the guy sat on me.

363
00:21:00,211 --> 00:21:03,345
So, wasn't really
much of a fight.

364
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:05,047
A toast, guys.

365
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:09,118
To my best man, Nick Young,
who can't fight for nuts,

366
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,719
but will always
have your back.

367
00:21:11,721 --> 00:21:14,957
A toast to married life.
To...

368
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:16,925
Not yet! Too early.
Oh, God!

369
00:21:16,927 --> 00:21:18,659
Well, this time
next week, guys!

370
00:21:20,297 --> 00:21:22,064
We gotta get over your
bachelor party first, matey.

371
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:24,099
Is that necessary, man?
Come on!

372
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:27,202
Listen, Rachel,
I know we've only just met,

373
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:29,204
but it's my bachelorette party
this weekend,

374
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:30,975
and I would love
for you to come.

375
00:21:32,443 --> 00:21:33,774
That'll be amazing.

376
00:21:33,776 --> 00:21:35,810
Thank you so much!
Good! Good!

377
00:21:35,812 --> 00:21:37,179
Am I out of the picture?
Thanks, man.

378
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:38,679
Am I totally
out of the picture?

379
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:39,680
Yes, I've replaced you
with Bernard.

380
00:21:39,682 --> 00:21:41,316
Screw that man!

381
00:21:41,318 --> 00:21:43,952
Also, I have to say,

382
00:21:43,954 --> 00:21:47,589
I can't remember the last time
I saw Nick like this.

383
00:21:47,591 --> 00:21:49,026
That's funny, though.

384
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:52,294
He's just happy to be home.

385
00:21:52,296 --> 00:21:54,831
Oh, yeah,
he's just happy to be home.

386
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:57,832
With you.

387
00:21:57,834 --> 00:21:59,700
Your dad
will be the death of you.

388
00:21:59,702 --> 00:22:00,835
My dad
will be the death of me.

389
00:22:00,837 --> 00:22:02,139
Oh, cheers to that.

390
00:22:05,342 --> 00:22:06,975
Guys, we have to dig in

391
00:22:06,977 --> 00:22:08,743
'cause this crab
is not gonna eat itself.

392
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:10,312
What should I try first?

393
00:22:10,314 --> 00:22:11,882
Try some of this. Thank you.
Do you want some of this?

394
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,883
It's really spicy.
It is really spicy.

395
00:22:53,557 --> 00:22:54,957
Whoo!

396
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:58,193
Nick's in Singapore!

397
00:22:58,195 --> 00:22:59,897
It's good to be home.

398
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:09,571
Is Michael here?
Not yet, ma'am.

399
00:23:09,573 --> 00:23:12,274
Also, your son woke up.
He wants to see you.

400
00:23:12,276 --> 00:23:13,741
All right.

401
00:23:13,743 --> 00:23:16,578
You know what to do. Quickly.

402
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:12,000
I'm sorry.
Got stuck in a meeting.

403
00:24:12,002 --> 00:24:13,402
It's okay. I get it.

404
00:24:13,404 --> 00:24:14,603
But don't forget,

405
00:24:14,605 --> 00:24:15,803
wedding festivities
start on Wednesday,

406
00:24:15,805 --> 00:24:17,339
so no emergencies next week.

407
00:24:17,341 --> 00:24:18,407
I know.

408
00:24:18,409 --> 00:24:20,208
Wouldn't dream
of missing a second

409
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,977
with your family
and their friends.

410
00:24:21,979 --> 00:24:23,545
Come on, it won't be all bad.

411
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:25,480
Nick and his new girlfriend
will be there.

412
00:24:25,482 --> 00:24:26,682
You'll like her.

413
00:24:26,684 --> 00:24:28,116
Oh, yeah?

414
00:24:28,118 --> 00:24:31,753
Why? 'Cause she's a commoner
like me?

415
00:24:31,755 --> 00:24:33,424
You know
that's not what I meant.

416
00:24:33,823 --> 00:24:35,857
Ooh.

417
00:24:35,859 --> 00:24:38,727
You know, I thought
I caught the maids

418
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:43,165
trying to shove a pair
of Jimmy Choos behind a dryer.

419
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:45,400
Yeah, I don't know
why you bother

420
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:47,703
trying to hide
your shopping from me.

421
00:24:47,705 --> 00:24:48,970
You can buy whatever you want.

422
00:24:48,972 --> 00:24:52,507
I get it.
Besides, everybody knows

423
00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:54,509
you wear the money pants
in this family.

424
00:24:54,511 --> 00:24:57,348
Pants are overrated.

425
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:01,385
Oh, I got you something, too.

426
00:25:05,656 --> 00:25:08,990
To celebrate
the launch of your startup.

427
00:25:08,992 --> 00:25:11,026
I know you don't like
expensive gifts,

428
00:25:11,028 --> 00:25:13,128
but you're not a captain
in the army anymore.

429
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:16,400
You're a CEO.
You should look the part.

430
00:25:21,805 --> 00:25:23,474
I...

431
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:29,446
I love it. Thank you.

432
00:25:59,743 --> 00:26:02,344
What time is it?

433
00:26:02,346 --> 00:26:03,812
Morning.

434
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:06,715
I'm afraid it's time for me
to do some groomsman duties.

435
00:26:06,717 --> 00:26:10,051
Stay in bed.

436
00:26:10,053 --> 00:26:12,689
You stay here.
I'll get you a breakfast tray.

437
00:26:20,464 --> 00:26:22,664
You know what?
I should get up, too.

438
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:25,167
I told Peik Lin I would
meet up with her today.

439
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:26,735
Ah, a little college reunion.

440
00:26:26,737 --> 00:26:28,537
But don't forget.
Dinner at Ah Ma's tonight.

441
00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:30,071
The whole family's
gonna be there.

442
00:26:30,073 --> 00:26:32,209
Yes.
I can't wait to show you off.

443
00:26:34,278 --> 00:26:37,181
Hubba, hubba.

444
00:26:37,781 --> 00:26:38,947
How can I resist?

445
00:26:38,949 --> 00:26:40,415
Ooga-ooga.

446
00:26:40,417 --> 00:26:42,784
You put those glasses on
on purpose.

447
00:27:08,178 --> 00:27:10,779
New York in the house!

448
00:27:10,781 --> 00:27:12,382
Yeah! Yeah!

449
00:27:12,983 --> 00:27:14,316
Peik Lin!

450
00:27:14,318 --> 00:27:18,119
What up, bitch? Yeah!

451
00:27:18,121 --> 00:27:20,121
Oh, my God! You look amazing.

452
00:27:20,123 --> 00:27:22,290
I know. Some things
never change, right?

453
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:25,193
And this is quite a place.

454
00:27:25,195 --> 00:27:28,663
Astor!
Vanderbilt! Rockefeller!

455
00:27:28,665 --> 00:27:31,968
Naughty, naughty boys.
Stop barking.

456
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:34,135
Hey, Rachel!
Hi!

457
00:27:34,137 --> 00:27:37,907
Singapore is so hot. Come in
and enjoy the aircon. Come on.

458
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:41,309
Whole family waiting to
meet you. Very excited.

459
00:27:41,311 --> 00:27:44,813
Rachel, welcome, welcome.

460
00:27:44,815 --> 00:27:46,515
Wow! Oh, my gosh!

461
00:27:46,517 --> 00:27:49,317
Your house is amazing,
Mrs. Goh.

462
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:55,925
Call me Auntie. Auntie Neenah.

463
00:27:55,927 --> 00:27:57,325
Sorry. Auntie Neenah.

464
00:27:57,327 --> 00:27:59,129
Oh, yeah.

465
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:04,599
We were inspired by

466
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:08,103
the Hall of Mirrors
in Versailles.

467
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:10,071
And Donald Trump's bathroom.

468
00:28:10,073 --> 00:28:12,140
Really?
Yeah.

469
00:28:12,142 --> 00:28:13,475
You like it or not?

470
00:28:13,477 --> 00:28:18,749
Oh, yes.
The gold is very brilliant.

471
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:26,022
Rachel Chu, we are so grateful

472
00:28:26,024 --> 00:28:28,490
for all the help
you have given

473
00:28:28,492 --> 00:28:32,394
my Peik Lin
back in her uni days.

474
00:28:32,396 --> 00:28:35,430
I mean, without you,
she would be a hot mess.

475
00:28:35,432 --> 00:28:37,699
Oh, my God, no.
Actually,

476
00:28:37,701 --> 00:28:39,434
if it wasn't for her,
I'd be a big mess.

477
00:28:39,436 --> 00:28:41,305
She was a huge help
to me in college.

478
00:28:42,306 --> 00:28:44,040
It's nice to meet you,
Mr. Goh.

479
00:28:44,042 --> 00:28:47,709
Nice to meet you, too, Chu.

480
00:28:47,711 --> 00:28:53,448
Ku-ku. Ku-Chu. You. Poo-poo.

481
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,017
No, I'm just kidding.

482
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:56,451
I don't have an accent.

483
00:28:56,453 --> 00:28:57,719
I'm just messing with you.

484
00:28:57,721 --> 00:28:59,554
No, I studied
in the States, too.

485
00:28:59,556 --> 00:29:01,389
Yeah, Cal State Fullerton.

486
00:29:01,391 --> 00:29:03,391
I majored in Thought.
Mmm.

487
00:29:03,393 --> 00:29:05,794
Don't stand
on ceremony, Rachel.

488
00:29:05,796 --> 00:29:07,395
This is simple food, lah.

489
00:29:07,397 --> 00:29:10,365
Ah, cha, cha, cha!
Don't be shy.

490
00:29:10,367 --> 00:29:12,233
Oh. Thank you.
You're not a model.

491
00:29:12,235 --> 00:29:13,602
I'm definitely not.

492
00:29:13,604 --> 00:29:16,104
No, you're not.
Not at all. Far from it.

493
00:29:16,106 --> 00:29:17,272
I know.

494
00:29:17,274 --> 00:29:19,041
Make sure you eat it all.

495
00:29:19,043 --> 00:29:20,675
'Cause I'm watching you.

496
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:22,711
Okay, thank you.
Okay, yeah.

497
00:29:22,713 --> 00:29:25,380
Ah Pa, can we go trampoline?
...go trampoline?

498
00:29:25,382 --> 00:29:27,649
You haven't finished
your nuggets yet, sweetie.

499
00:29:27,651 --> 00:29:28,985
Okay, there's
a lot of children

500
00:29:28,987 --> 00:29:30,853
starving in America, right?

501
00:29:30,855 --> 00:29:33,622
I mean, take a look at her.
She's American, huh?

502
00:29:33,624 --> 00:29:35,590
Really skinny.
You wanna look like that?

503
00:29:35,592 --> 00:29:36,524
No.

504
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:37,862
Then eat your nuggets!

505
00:29:39,296 --> 00:29:42,064
So, Rachel,
what you do in America?

506
00:29:42,066 --> 00:29:43,331
Um...

507
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:46,701
I'm an economics professor.
Wow.

508
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:50,906
Very impressive.
Econ professor, eh?

509
00:29:50,908 --> 00:29:54,509
Wow, you must be very smart.
Good for you.

510
00:29:54,511 --> 00:29:55,777
Let me get this straight.

511
00:29:55,779 --> 00:29:57,646
You both went
to the same school,

512
00:29:57,648 --> 00:30:00,548
yet someone came back
with a degree that's useful.

513
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:03,654
And the other one came back
as Asian Ellen.

514
00:30:08,492 --> 00:30:10,126
Psst, P.T.

515
00:30:10,128 --> 00:30:11,826
Hmm?

516
00:30:11,828 --> 00:30:12,995
Look over here.

517
00:30:12,997 --> 00:30:14,562
She's a hottie.

518
00:30:14,564 --> 00:30:16,932
This is the kind of girl
you should date.

519
00:30:16,934 --> 00:30:21,003
Smart, beautiful.
Not those like K-Pop skanks

520
00:30:21,005 --> 00:30:25,107
with no brain,
big eyes and small backsides.

521
00:30:25,109 --> 00:30:27,208
She has an amazing backside.

522
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:29,511
This is Goh standard.

523
00:30:29,513 --> 00:30:31,881
Don't be shy.
Just talk to her.

524
00:30:31,883 --> 00:30:33,015
I love you.

525
00:30:33,017 --> 00:30:34,716
Okay. No, just, uh...

526
00:30:34,718 --> 00:30:36,351
Pa, she's here
with her boyfriend.

527
00:30:37,621 --> 00:30:39,421
I don't see no ring
on her finger.

528
00:30:39,423 --> 00:30:40,856
Well,
my boyfriend's actually

529
00:30:40,858 --> 00:30:42,524
from Singapore
and that's why we're here.

530
00:30:42,526 --> 00:30:44,559
We're here to go
to his best friend's wedding,

531
00:30:44,561 --> 00:30:46,561
where he's gonna be
the best man.

532
00:30:46,563 --> 00:30:48,430
Hmm.
What's his name?

533
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:51,499
This is a very small island.
Maybe we know his family.

534
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:52,937
His name is Nick Young.

535
00:31:01,578 --> 00:31:02,677
Uh...

536
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:04,481
The Nick you're dating
is Nick Young?

537
00:31:06,349 --> 00:31:08,416
His best friend...

538
00:31:08,418 --> 00:31:10,886
You're invited
to Colin Khoo's wedding, ah?

539
00:31:10,888 --> 00:31:13,889
Yeah. You guys
know them or something?

540
00:31:13,891 --> 00:31:15,323
Hells yeah.

541
00:31:15,325 --> 00:31:16,791
The Khoos, the Youngs...

542
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:18,961
I mean, who doesn't know
who they are?

543
00:31:18,963 --> 00:31:20,795
They're just
the biggest developers...

544
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:22,831
...in all of Singapore.

545
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:26,401
And Malaysia, Thailand,
Brunei, New Mexico.

546
00:31:26,403 --> 00:31:27,602
She gets it.

547
00:31:27,604 --> 00:31:29,304
Colin and Araminta's wedding

548
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:31,406
is Singapore's
event of the century.

549
00:31:31,408 --> 00:31:33,641
The Youngs are like royalty.

550
00:31:33,643 --> 00:31:35,443
Did you not know?
Does she not know?

551
00:31:35,445 --> 00:31:37,579
Why you never
say before?

552
00:31:37,581 --> 00:31:40,515
Tell, tell,
what are they like?

553
00:31:40,517 --> 00:31:43,052
I don't really know
what they're...

554
00:31:43,054 --> 00:31:45,353
I haven't met them yet.
I'm gonna meet them tonight.

555
00:31:45,355 --> 00:31:46,721
I'm going to
Nick's grandma's house.

556
00:31:48,092 --> 00:31:50,258
You're going to Nick's
grandma's house wearing this?

557
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,760
Wearing that?

558
00:31:57,068 --> 00:31:58,533
No way. No way.

559
00:31:58,535 --> 00:32:00,368
Yeah, I thought
red was a lucky color, right?

560
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:04,606
Yeah. If you're an envelope.
Zing! Nailed it!

561
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:07,009
Zing!

562
00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:09,511
Rachel, these people
aren't just rich, okay?

563
00:32:09,513 --> 00:32:11,846
They're crazy rich. Look.

564
00:32:11,848 --> 00:32:13,448
There's new money
all over Asia.

565
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,582
We got
the Beijing billionaires,

566
00:32:14,584 --> 00:32:16,051
the Taiwan tycoons...

567
00:32:16,053 --> 00:32:18,254
But the Young family,
they're old-money rich.

568
00:32:18,256 --> 00:32:21,689
They had money when
they left China in the 1800s.

569
00:32:21,691 --> 00:32:24,860
And they went
all the way down here.

570
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:27,529
Not there... Here.

571
00:32:27,531 --> 00:32:29,064
They came to Singapore

572
00:32:29,066 --> 00:32:30,632
when there was nothing
but jungle and pig farmers.

573
00:32:30,634 --> 00:32:32,201
There was a snake here,
eating an apple.

574
00:32:32,203 --> 00:32:34,769
You know what I mean?
And they built all of this.

575
00:32:34,771 --> 00:32:36,304
Now, they're the landlords

576
00:32:36,306 --> 00:32:38,073
of the most expensive city
in the world. Here you go.

577
00:32:38,075 --> 00:32:42,410
These people are so posh
and snobby, they're snoshy.

578
00:32:42,412 --> 00:32:43,711
Here you go.

579
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:45,313
Yeah,
but Nick's not like that.

580
00:32:45,315 --> 00:32:47,315
Even if he isn't,
I guarantee you the family is.

581
00:32:47,317 --> 00:32:48,583
Which is why tonight,

582
00:32:48,585 --> 00:32:49,584
you need to not look
like Sebastian

583
00:32:49,586 --> 00:32:50,718
of The Little Mermaid.

584
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,288
You know, the little crab guy?

585
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,260
Look at this guy,
he's sleeping.

586
00:32:58,262 --> 00:32:59,727
Come on,

587
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:01,396
this isn't
your grandma's road.

588
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:03,132
God damn it!

589
00:33:03,134 --> 00:33:04,566
Thank you for driving me.

590
00:33:04,568 --> 00:33:06,434
Duh. This is like
my one chance to see

591
00:33:06,436 --> 00:33:08,436
the Young family mansion.
Mmm.

592
00:33:15,246 --> 00:33:16,845
At the next intersection,

593
00:33:16,847 --> 00:33:18,015
make a U-turn.

594
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:20,115
Make a U-turn.

595
00:33:20,117 --> 00:33:21,884
Are you sure
you gave me the right address?

596
00:33:21,886 --> 00:33:23,551
The GPS says there's, like,
nothing here.

597
00:33:23,553 --> 00:33:25,388
Like, literally nothing.

598
00:33:29,894 --> 00:33:31,726
I don't know
why we're here.

599
00:33:31,728 --> 00:33:34,263
I mean,
I put in the exact address.

600
00:33:34,265 --> 00:33:36,764
You copied and you pasted it?
Yeah.

601
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:38,000
Did you just
copy and paste "jungle"

602
00:33:38,002 --> 00:33:39,869
and just kind of
threw it in there?

603
00:33:39,871 --> 00:33:41,303
No. This is the address...
Because I feel like that's...

604
00:33:41,305 --> 00:33:43,571
You actually used the...
Okay! All right.

605
00:33:43,573 --> 00:33:46,208
That's a...
Uh, hi! So we'll just...

606
00:33:47,744 --> 00:33:49,844
Hello, sir. How are you?

607
00:33:49,846 --> 00:33:51,914
We're here for the party,
and we're...

608
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:53,781
We come in peace.

609
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:56,551
Do you know where
the Young family house is?

610
00:33:56,553 --> 00:33:58,620
Nicholas Young?
I'm Rachel Chu.

611
00:33:58,622 --> 00:34:01,056
I'm here to go
to his family dinner.

612
00:34:01,058 --> 00:34:04,792
Uh, Rachel Chu for the list.
If there is a list.

613
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:06,761
He's on the phone.
He's on the phone.

614
00:34:06,763 --> 00:34:08,898
Is that a gun knife?
It's a knife gun.

615
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,836
Okay, and there's a friend.
Hi! Very nice to...

616
00:34:14,305 --> 00:34:17,373
We can go through?
We're going through? Okay.

617
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:19,576
Don't stab the car.
Okay.

618
00:34:21,778 --> 00:34:26,183
Okay, okay. Thank you, bye!

619
00:34:48,272 --> 00:34:51,106
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

620
00:34:51,108 --> 00:34:55,044
Beautiful? It's 200 mil
worth of real estate.

621
00:34:55,046 --> 00:34:57,081
It's spectacular.

622
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:29,111
Damn, Rachel.
He's like the Asian Bachelor.

623
00:35:29,113 --> 00:35:30,247
Thanks, brother.

624
00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:36,921
Hello, gorgeous.

625
00:35:43,793 --> 00:35:46,527
Wow! I think I've just fallen
in love with you

626
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:48,698
all over again.

627
00:35:53,737 --> 00:35:56,472
Rachel!

628
00:35:56,474 --> 00:35:57,605
I missed you, too.

629
00:35:57,607 --> 00:35:59,441
Yeah?
What did you get up to?

630
00:35:59,443 --> 00:36:01,542
Psst! Rachel!

631
00:36:01,544 --> 00:36:04,512
Oh, uh, this is my friend,
Peik Lin.

632
00:36:04,514 --> 00:36:05,881
Hi, there.
Howdy.

633
00:36:05,883 --> 00:36:07,116
Thank you very much
for bringing Rachel.

634
00:36:07,118 --> 00:36:08,150
Oh, no worries.

635
00:36:08,152 --> 00:36:09,918
Do you wanna stop by
for some dinner?

636
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,387
Oh, no, I couldn't impose.
No, it's not a problem.

637
00:36:11,389 --> 00:36:12,787
I had some dinner plans.
Seriously, we've got...

638
00:36:12,789 --> 00:36:14,191
Yeah, I'll fucking come
to dinner.

639
00:36:18,462 --> 00:36:19,827
I missed you.
Did you?

640
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:21,529
Yes.
How was your day?

641
00:36:21,531 --> 00:36:23,499
It was fun!
I got to meet

642
00:36:23,501 --> 00:36:25,702
Peik Lin's whole family,
her dog.

643
00:36:28,705 --> 00:36:29,874
Nope.

644
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:34,343
You have a cocktail dress
in your trunk?

645
00:36:34,345 --> 00:36:35,777
I'm not an animal, Rachel.

646
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:43,551
I thought
this was just a family thing.

647
00:36:43,553 --> 00:36:46,488
My grandmother's invited some
of her friends over tonight.

648
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:49,724
Her tan huas are blooming.
It's a whole thing.

649
00:36:49,726 --> 00:36:51,228
You ready for this?

650
00:36:54,764 --> 00:36:58,333
Oh, damn, Nick.
It's a party though. Okay.

651
00:37:10,081 --> 00:37:11,646
The good bathrooms
are up the stairs,

652
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:13,115
and you can
get changed in there.

653
00:37:13,117 --> 00:37:15,785
Okay, good, I'll find it.
Thank you.

654
00:37:27,231 --> 00:37:28,830
You know,
when you said you grew up

655
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:30,631
in your grandma's house,

656
00:37:30,633 --> 00:37:33,701
I wasn't expecting this.

657
00:37:33,703 --> 00:37:35,204
Thank you.

658
00:37:35,206 --> 00:37:38,974
Oh, no, no.
Those are for your fingers.

659
00:37:38,976 --> 00:37:40,542
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

660
00:37:40,544 --> 00:37:42,311
A little bit much, I know.

661
00:37:42,313 --> 00:37:44,446
I mean,
this place is gorgeous.

662
00:37:44,448 --> 00:37:46,014
And like
the rolling green hills.

663
00:37:46,016 --> 00:37:49,485
I mean, there are
armed guards out there.

664
00:37:49,487 --> 00:37:50,853
And a giant tiger.

665
00:37:50,855 --> 00:37:52,822
Okay.

666
00:37:53,623 --> 00:37:56,258
That is Mr. Harimau.

667
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,626
Now, my great-grandfather
actually shot him

668
00:37:58,628 --> 00:38:00,262
when he ran into the house.

669
00:38:00,264 --> 00:38:04,333
But Astrid and I, we used to
hide cigarettes in his paws.

670
00:38:04,335 --> 00:38:05,733
Do you wanna head in?

671
00:38:05,735 --> 00:38:07,903
Actually, I wanted to
bring you over

672
00:38:07,905 --> 00:38:09,340
to my mum first.
Oh.

673
00:38:09,739 --> 00:38:11,275
Come on.

674
00:38:52,349 --> 00:38:53,417
Mum.

675
00:38:56,353 --> 00:38:58,921
You need a haircut.
So unkempt.

676
00:38:58,923 --> 00:39:00,721
And you look tired
from your trip.

677
00:39:00,723 --> 00:39:03,824
I'm gonna ask the cook
to make you some herbal soup.

678
00:39:05,396 --> 00:39:07,429
I'll send it
to the hotel later.

679
00:39:07,431 --> 00:39:10,098
Mum, this is Rachel Chu.

680
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,734
Oh, my gosh! I'm so happy
to meet you, Mrs. Young.

681
00:39:13,736 --> 00:39:16,038
Or Auntie. Right?

682
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,107
I'm learning
the lingo.

683
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:21,343
I'm very glad
to finally meet you, too.

684
00:39:21,345 --> 00:39:23,844
And I'm sorry Nick's father
couldn't be here.

685
00:39:23,846 --> 00:39:25,914
He was called to business
in Shanghai.

686
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:29,351
I told Rachel when duty calls,
Dad answers.

687
00:39:29,353 --> 00:39:30,419
As it should be.

688
00:39:30,421 --> 00:39:32,521
Nick tells me
you're a professor, too.

689
00:39:32,523 --> 00:39:33,889
What do you teach?

690
00:39:33,891 --> 00:39:35,424
Um, I teach economics.

691
00:39:35,426 --> 00:39:38,462
And she's brilliant.
NYU's youngest faculty member.

692
00:39:42,533 --> 00:39:44,099
So, economics...

693
00:39:44,101 --> 00:39:45,667
Sounds challenging.

694
00:39:45,669 --> 00:39:47,402
Are your parents
academics as well?

695
00:39:47,404 --> 00:39:51,039
No. Well, my dad actually died
before I was born,

696
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:53,175
and my mom
didn't even go to college.

697
00:39:53,177 --> 00:39:55,010
She actually hardly spoke
any English

698
00:39:55,012 --> 00:39:57,246
when she immigrated
to the United States.

699
00:39:57,248 --> 00:39:59,814
But she worked really hard,
and she studied,

700
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:01,516
and she earned
her real estate license

701
00:40:01,518 --> 00:40:03,986
while she was waiting tables
to support us.

702
00:40:03,988 --> 00:40:05,454
Now, she likes to say

703
00:40:05,456 --> 00:40:08,123
that she's Flushing's
top real estate broker.

704
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:13,695
Self-made woman.
She must be so proud of you.

705
00:40:13,697 --> 00:40:16,098
Well, she knows that I'm
passionate about what I do,

706
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,868
and she's always
wanted that for me.

707
00:40:19,203 --> 00:40:23,272
Pursuing one's passion.
How American.

708
00:40:23,274 --> 00:40:25,974
Well, your mother's
very open-minded,

709
00:40:25,976 --> 00:40:27,576
not like here,

710
00:40:27,578 --> 00:40:29,244
where parents are obsessed

711
00:40:29,246 --> 00:40:31,213
with shaping the life
of their children.

712
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,650
That's dinner.

713
00:40:34,652 --> 00:40:35,851
Go ahead.

714
00:40:35,853 --> 00:40:37,185
I'll be out in a minute.

715
00:40:37,187 --> 00:40:39,721
Rachel, it was lovely
meeting you.

716
00:40:39,723 --> 00:40:42,991
Thank you. You, too.

717
00:40:42,993 --> 00:40:44,792
Okay, she hates me.

718
00:40:44,794 --> 00:40:46,695
She takes a little minute
to warm up,

719
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:48,866
but we'll get there.
A minute?

720
00:41:02,012 --> 00:41:04,448
Nicki! Rachel!
Astrid.

721
00:41:05,215 --> 00:41:07,082
Hey. Good to see you.

722
00:41:07,084 --> 00:41:08,216
I'm so glad you could make it.

723
00:41:08,218 --> 00:41:09,685
Michael.
Nick.

724
00:41:09,687 --> 00:41:11,219
Astrid. So good
to see a face I know.

725
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:12,854
This is my husband, Michael.

726
00:41:12,856 --> 00:41:15,057
Nice to meet you.
Heard so much about you.

727
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:16,425
Nice to meet you, Michael.

728
00:41:16,427 --> 00:41:19,561
Hey, the golden boy's back!
Nick!

729
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:21,829
And you must be Rachel.

730
00:41:21,831 --> 00:41:23,865
I'm Edison Cheng.
This is my wife.

731
00:41:23,867 --> 00:41:25,300
Hi. I'm...
Her name is Fiona.

732
00:41:25,302 --> 00:41:27,102
So I see you've already met
Princess Astrid

733
00:41:27,104 --> 00:41:29,538
and her little
soldier toy-boy, Mikey.

734
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,740
You know, Mikey is a big-shot
tech startup guy.

735
00:41:31,742 --> 00:41:33,141
So if you forget
your password,

736
00:41:33,143 --> 00:41:34,676
he's your man.

737
00:41:34,678 --> 00:41:38,180
So you're from the Taiwan
plastic Chus, right?

738
00:41:38,182 --> 00:41:40,949
Can I punch him in the face?
Just once.

739
00:41:40,951 --> 00:41:42,217
Take a number.

740
00:41:42,219 --> 00:41:45,420
I'll be in my usual corner.
Champagne?

741
00:41:45,422 --> 00:41:46,990
Thank you.

742
00:41:51,161 --> 00:41:54,830
So, have you prepped Rachel
to face the wolves?

743
00:41:54,832 --> 00:41:56,498
Rachel is a New Yorker.

744
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,267
She lectures millennials
for a living.

745
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:01,336
I think she'll manage
our family.

746
00:42:01,338 --> 00:42:03,772
You've been away too long.

747
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:05,240
Okay, sorry, time out.

748
00:42:05,242 --> 00:42:07,409
So you're not
from a Taiwan Chu family?

749
00:42:07,411 --> 00:42:08,744
Nope.

750
00:42:08,746 --> 00:42:10,312
Hong Kong telecom Chus?

751
00:42:10,314 --> 00:42:11,246
No.

752
00:42:11,248 --> 00:42:13,215
Malaysian packing peanut Chus?

753
00:42:13,217 --> 00:42:14,683
Is that really a thing?

754
00:42:14,685 --> 00:42:16,618
Yeah, it's everywhere.
I'm gonna stop you there

755
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,320
because I'm gonna take her
on the rounds.

756
00:42:18,322 --> 00:42:20,322
We'll be back, though.
No, wait. Hang on.

757
00:42:20,324 --> 00:42:23,325
China instant noodle Chus.
Rachel,

758
00:42:23,327 --> 00:42:26,163
Chu are you?

759
00:42:27,131 --> 00:42:29,400
Ugh. Let's go.

760
00:42:32,369 --> 00:42:34,936
This is Auntie Alix
and Auntie Felicity.

761
00:42:34,938 --> 00:42:36,805
Hi!
It's so nice to meet you.

762
00:42:36,807 --> 00:42:39,641
I've never been
to a tan hua party before.

763
00:42:39,643 --> 00:42:41,943
We love any excuse
to throw a soiree.

764
00:42:41,945 --> 00:42:44,045
Do your parents like
to entertain?

765
00:42:44,047 --> 00:42:47,050
Oh. I'm sorry.
Your mother's single.

766
00:42:47,618 --> 00:42:49,017
Yup.

767
00:42:49,019 --> 00:42:50,318
Auntie Jacqueline.

768
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,720
One of my parents'
oldest friends.

769
00:42:51,722 --> 00:42:55,023
I actually met Nick's father
at Cambridge.

770
00:42:55,025 --> 00:42:57,959
So, what line of work
is your father in?

771
00:42:57,961 --> 00:43:00,162
Oh, my father died
before I was born.

772
00:43:00,164 --> 00:43:03,131
But he was a factory worker
in China.

773
00:43:18,282 --> 00:43:20,182
This is Ling Cheh,

774
00:43:20,184 --> 00:43:22,219
my old nanny.

775
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:30,125
Look, now's the time
we need all hands on deck.

776
00:43:30,127 --> 00:43:32,294
Please, please,
just do me this favor.

777
00:43:32,296 --> 00:43:34,064
Thank you. Bye-bye.

778
00:43:35,332 --> 00:43:37,732
They started
clearing away dinner.

779
00:43:37,734 --> 00:43:39,369
Your favorites.

780
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,539
Thank you.

781
00:43:44,641 --> 00:43:46,575
You know if you need
bodies at the office,

782
00:43:46,577 --> 00:43:48,345
I could always come in
and help out.

783
00:43:50,214 --> 00:43:52,314
The glamorous Astrid Leong

784
00:43:52,316 --> 00:43:55,817
working as an assistant?
Mmm-hmm.

785
00:43:55,819 --> 00:44:00,489
Wait, isn't Araminta's
bachelorette party tomorrow?

786
00:44:00,491 --> 00:44:04,025
And this will be the perfect
excuse to get out of it.

787
00:44:04,027 --> 00:44:06,394
Thank you. Really.

788
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:08,432
But I've got
everything covered.

789
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:10,767
Okay.

790
00:44:11,936 --> 00:44:13,401
I forgot to get you a fork.

791
00:44:13,403 --> 00:44:15,506
It's okay, you stay.
I'll go get it.

792
00:44:24,348 --> 00:44:27,351
Michael,
I think it's the office.

793
00:44:42,799 --> 00:44:45,868
Oh, my God! Nick, I can't
believe I just did that.

794
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:47,702
It's fine. I don't think
anybody even noticed.

795
00:44:47,704 --> 00:44:49,604
I think I freaked out
your nanny...

796
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:51,840
Oh, my God!

797
00:44:51,842 --> 00:44:53,174
So sorry.

798
00:44:53,176 --> 00:44:54,209
It's fine,
don't worry about it.

799
00:44:54,211 --> 00:44:55,610
Can I have a tissue please?

800
00:44:55,612 --> 00:44:58,246
Go, go. Get changed.
I'll keep Rachel company.

801
00:44:58,248 --> 00:45:00,248
Thank you, Oli.
You're in good hands.

802
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:01,616
Give me two minutes.
I'll change.

803
00:45:01,618 --> 00:45:03,153
Sorry.

804
00:45:04,821 --> 00:45:06,054
Hi, I'm Rachel.

805
00:45:06,056 --> 00:45:07,689
Oh, I know.

806
00:45:07,691 --> 00:45:09,691
Rachel! Rachel!

807
00:45:09,693 --> 00:45:11,628
I heard you thought
Ah Ma was the cook!

808
00:45:12,997 --> 00:45:14,529
Ahh!

809
00:45:14,531 --> 00:45:17,265
On the bright side,
you're the talk of the party.

810
00:45:17,267 --> 00:45:18,833
People like your dress.

811
00:45:18,835 --> 00:45:19,936
Oh, I did that.

812
00:45:19,938 --> 00:45:21,136
Oh.
I know!

813
00:45:21,138 --> 00:45:23,039
Such a chic '70s goddess.

814
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:24,472
I know.

815
00:45:24,474 --> 00:45:26,441
It's very disco Cleopatra,
but in a good way.

816
00:45:26,443 --> 00:45:27,977
That's exactly
what I was going for.

817
00:45:27,979 --> 00:45:30,612
Oh, well. Oliver.

818
00:45:30,614 --> 00:45:32,280
Hi.
I like your shoes.

819
00:45:32,282 --> 00:45:34,016
Oh, thank you.
I'm Peik Lin. Ditto.

820
00:45:34,018 --> 00:45:35,417
Cheers.
There you go.

821
00:45:35,419 --> 00:45:36,886
Gosh, these are lovely.

822
00:45:36,888 --> 00:45:37,954
They're clip-ons. Thank you.

823
00:45:37,956 --> 00:45:39,588
Are they? Oh, wow!

824
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:41,590
So, Oliver,
are you a cousin, too?

825
00:45:41,592 --> 00:45:45,027
Mmm. Well, I'm one of
the poorer relations.

826
00:45:45,029 --> 00:45:46,597
The rainbow sheep
of the family.

827
00:45:47,798 --> 00:45:49,097
But I make myself useful.

828
00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:51,199
Whatever the Youngs want,
I procure.

829
00:45:51,201 --> 00:45:54,202
Golden koi fish,
Huanghuali furniture.

830
00:45:54,204 --> 00:45:55,737
A rare Cambodian gong.

831
00:45:55,739 --> 00:45:58,709
Why would they want to buy
a rare Cambodian gong?

832
00:46:01,812 --> 00:46:03,480
Because they can.

833
00:46:08,352 --> 00:46:10,987
Ah Ma insists
all your clothes be washed

834
00:46:10,989 --> 00:46:12,789
and pressed every two weeks.

835
00:46:14,959 --> 00:46:16,859
This one.

836
00:46:16,861 --> 00:46:20,163
Everything is exactly
as I left it.

837
00:46:28,271 --> 00:46:30,305
Looking for your cigars?

838
00:46:30,307 --> 00:46:32,809
I had them thrown out
years ago.

839
00:46:35,412 --> 00:46:37,178
Never could get
anything past you, could I?

840
00:46:38,815 --> 00:46:41,951
I keep telling Ah Ma
to put your things away,

841
00:46:41,953 --> 00:46:43,284
but she says this room

842
00:46:43,286 --> 00:46:45,322
makes her feel
like you're still here.

843
00:46:47,391 --> 00:46:49,457
Well, I got an earful

844
00:46:49,459 --> 00:46:52,229
when you didn't move back
last year.

845
00:46:53,397 --> 00:46:56,231
Your father and I were really

846
00:46:56,233 --> 00:46:58,201
looking forward
to having you home.

847
00:47:01,171 --> 00:47:02,940
He's not getting any younger.

848
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,974
With you onboard,

849
00:47:04,976 --> 00:47:07,444
maybe he'll take a day off
once in a while.

850
00:47:08,845 --> 00:47:10,845
I know, Mum.

851
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:13,082
I'm just not ready yet.

852
00:47:13,084 --> 00:47:15,652
There's things in New York
that I wanna see through.

853
00:47:18,355 --> 00:47:22,091
Well, I'm happy
I finally met Rachel.

854
00:47:22,093 --> 00:47:24,325
She is very impressive.

855
00:47:24,327 --> 00:47:26,461
I think so, too.

856
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,729
I thought
you might be excited

857
00:47:27,731 --> 00:47:30,198
that the first girl
that I bring home

858
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,402
is a Chinese professor.

859
00:47:33,737 --> 00:47:36,174
Chinese American.

860
00:47:39,443 --> 00:47:42,912
You know, bringing her home,

861
00:47:42,914 --> 00:47:46,249
introducing her
at a large family gathering,

862
00:47:47,051 --> 00:47:48,650
some people may say...

863
00:47:48,652 --> 00:47:50,853
When there's something
to say

864
00:47:50,855 --> 00:47:54,389
about Rachel and me,
you'll be first to hear.

865
00:47:57,461 --> 00:48:02,764
But some things I need to
figure out on my own.

866
00:48:02,766 --> 00:48:05,836
Is that an American accent
I'm hearing?

867
00:48:07,738 --> 00:48:08,873
How do I look?

868
00:48:16,346 --> 00:48:17,781
Perfect.

869
00:48:31,361 --> 00:48:33,461
Everyone! Everyone!

870
00:48:33,463 --> 00:48:36,464
The tan hua plants
very rarely bloom,

871
00:48:36,466 --> 00:48:38,901
and even then only at night.

872
00:48:38,903 --> 00:48:43,505
Their beauty is spectacular
but fleeting.

873
00:48:43,507 --> 00:48:46,441
By dawn, they'll be gone.

874
00:48:46,443 --> 00:48:48,645
Come. Come.

875
00:48:57,287 --> 00:48:59,855
Oh, someone forgot
to wear a bra.

876
00:48:59,857 --> 00:49:04,759
Kitty Pong. Cousin Alistair's
latest flame. An actress.

877
00:49:04,761 --> 00:49:09,265
Rumor is, she was in a porno.
Two Girls, One Cup of Noodles.

878
00:49:09,267 --> 00:49:11,967
You know, I thought I would
like that more than I did.

879
00:49:11,969 --> 00:49:13,971
The book was much better.
Mmm-hmm.

880
00:49:16,573 --> 00:49:20,642
Is it just me
or are people staring at me?

881
00:49:20,644 --> 00:49:24,345
Oh, they're just jealous.
You nabbed the crown prince.

882
00:49:24,347 --> 00:49:27,917
Nicki is Ah Ma's favorite,
in line to inherit everything.

883
00:49:27,919 --> 00:49:30,752
No surprise there
when that's the competition.

884
00:49:32,823 --> 00:49:34,926
Oh, speaking of
the grande dame...

885
00:49:56,981 --> 00:49:57,947
There you are.

886
00:49:57,949 --> 00:49:59,347
I've been looking
all over for you.

887
00:49:59,349 --> 00:50:01,785
You ready to meet
my grandmother?

888
00:50:03,888 --> 00:50:05,122
Ah Ma...

889
00:50:47,631 --> 00:50:50,165
Look,
they're in full bloom.

890
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:09,517
It's so nice
having Nick back home.

891
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:12,023
But he seems different.

892
00:51:14,058 --> 00:51:17,458
When children are away
from home too long,

893
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,496
they forget who they are.

894
00:51:29,572 --> 00:51:31,773
What's up? Let's jam!

895
00:51:38,916 --> 00:51:43,451
Rachel!
So happy you're here. Oh!

896
00:51:43,453 --> 00:51:47,356
Oh, my God.
Your Gap look, brilliant.

897
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:49,158
Thanks.

898
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,559
She's coming with me.
Uh, hold on.

899
00:51:51,561 --> 00:51:53,561
Kiss. 36 hours. Bye.

900
00:51:53,563 --> 00:51:55,797
Minty, one piece please.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

901
00:51:55,799 --> 00:51:57,465
Not listening at all.

902
00:51:57,467 --> 00:52:00,002
So, I'm gonna intro you
to my posse.

903
00:52:00,004 --> 00:52:02,972
We're flying to
my mom's resort in Sumatra.

904
00:52:02,974 --> 00:52:06,909
She's closed down
the whole place just for us.

905
00:52:06,911 --> 00:52:08,843
We're gonna have so much fun.

906
00:52:08,845 --> 00:52:12,047
Come on, meet the girls.
Girls, this is Rachel Chu.

907
00:52:12,049 --> 00:52:13,050
Hi!

908
00:52:18,155 --> 00:52:20,521
So you let Bernard Tai
organize all of this?

909
00:52:20,523 --> 00:52:21,758
Yeah.

910
00:52:22,826 --> 00:52:23,926
Bernard.

911
00:52:23,928 --> 00:52:24,996
Hey.

912
00:52:25,762 --> 00:52:28,232
This is for you, asshole.

913
00:52:31,435 --> 00:52:36,537
Tina! Tini!
The twins are in the house!

914
00:52:36,539 --> 00:52:40,541
I'm so glad you made it!
How are you?

915
00:52:40,543 --> 00:52:42,077
It's easy to make
a killer entrance

916
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:44,013
when you come
as a matching set.

917
00:52:44,015 --> 00:52:47,216
Hi, we haven't met.
I'm Amanda Ling.

918
00:52:47,218 --> 00:52:49,451
Hi, I'm Rachel Chu.

919
00:52:49,453 --> 00:52:51,220
Oh, you're
Nick Young's friend.

920
00:52:51,222 --> 00:52:53,788
Yeah.
Word gets around fast here.

921
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:56,325
You're a professor
at NYU, right?

922
00:52:56,327 --> 00:52:58,559
Yes. Um, what about you?

923
00:52:58,561 --> 00:53:00,728
Oh, I'm a lawyer.
General counsel

924
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:02,830
to the Young Family
Corporation, actually.

925
00:53:02,832 --> 00:53:04,299
That's very impressive.

926
00:53:04,301 --> 00:53:07,169
Mmm. Nah. Just good,
old-fashioned nepotism.

927
00:53:07,171 --> 00:53:10,105
I grew up with Nick and Colin.
We're family friends.

928
00:53:10,107 --> 00:53:12,241
It's nice to meet you,
Rachel Chu.

929
00:53:13,743 --> 00:53:17,645
Ladies, come on.
We're wheels up in five.

930
00:53:17,647 --> 00:53:18,947
Let's do this?

931
00:53:18,949 --> 00:53:20,249
Let's go.

932
00:53:26,424 --> 00:53:28,457
Yeah!

933
00:53:28,459 --> 00:53:31,860
All I wanted was a weekend
away with my boys.

934
00:53:31,862 --> 00:53:34,329
And some beer.
Maybe some rugby.

935
00:53:34,331 --> 00:53:37,066
Don't worry. It's gonna be
great, whatever happens.

936
00:53:37,068 --> 00:53:38,100
Yeah.

937
00:53:38,102 --> 00:53:40,235
Let's make
some babies!

938
00:53:40,237 --> 00:53:43,140
I don't think it will be.

939
00:53:53,951 --> 00:53:56,818
Any asshole can plan
a normal stag party.

940
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:00,322
Hookers, drugs, dog-fighting.

941
00:54:00,324 --> 00:54:02,891
That's minor league shit.

942
00:54:02,893 --> 00:54:05,160
To organize a party
this massive...

943
00:54:05,162 --> 00:54:07,463
Takes a massive asshole.

944
00:54:07,465 --> 00:54:10,032
...takes a goddamn mastermind.

945
00:54:10,034 --> 00:54:12,103
Where exactly is this party?

946
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:15,106
It's right there.

947
00:54:19,577 --> 00:54:21,011
Bloody hell!

948
00:54:31,721 --> 00:54:32,820
Whoo!

949
00:55:03,087 --> 00:55:04,652
Did you just see that?

950
00:55:04,654 --> 00:55:06,787
Oh, my God, Nick.
What are you worried about?

951
00:55:06,789 --> 00:55:08,023
You don't have to
keep Rachel happy.

952
00:55:08,025 --> 00:55:09,591
She's just lucky to be here.

953
00:55:09,593 --> 00:55:10,959
Nice, Eddie.

954
00:55:10,961 --> 00:55:12,494
Oh, what?

955
00:55:12,496 --> 00:55:14,329
So we're gonna pretend
like that's not the truth?

956
00:55:14,331 --> 00:55:15,730
Are we in some kind of
fairy tale story

957
00:55:15,732 --> 00:55:16,965
that I don't know about?

958
00:55:16,967 --> 00:55:18,400
Did you find a shoe
at midnight

959
00:55:18,402 --> 00:55:19,834
and jump in a pumpkin?

960
00:55:19,836 --> 00:55:22,271
Yo, I got so much shit
about marrying Fiona,

961
00:55:22,273 --> 00:55:23,472
and her parents own

962
00:55:23,474 --> 00:55:25,541
the biggest shipping company
in Hong Kong.

963
00:55:25,543 --> 00:55:28,010
Hey, Araminta's adorable,
but you think your dad

964
00:55:28,012 --> 00:55:29,578
would be spending millions
on this wedding

965
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:32,881
if her parents didn't own
a billion-dollar resort chain?

966
00:55:32,883 --> 00:55:35,017
What's Rachel bringing
to the table?

967
00:55:35,019 --> 00:55:37,619
Oh! Small tits!

968
00:55:37,621 --> 00:55:39,021
Oh!

969
00:55:39,023 --> 00:55:41,990
Hey. It's not worth it, man.
They're drunk.

970
00:55:41,992 --> 00:55:45,861
Hey, guys,
this is boring. Massage time.

971
00:55:45,863 --> 00:55:48,497
And you, the bachelor,

972
00:55:48,499 --> 00:55:51,266
you're gonna get one
before this weekend is over.

973
00:55:51,268 --> 00:55:54,970
Or we're gonna tie you up
and shave your coo coo chara.

974
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,240
Coo coo chara!

975
00:55:58,242 --> 00:56:00,477
Hey, come try this.

976
00:56:01,778 --> 00:56:03,846
We have to get off this ship.

977
00:56:14,925 --> 00:56:17,960
Welcome to paradise.

978
00:56:17,962 --> 00:56:21,398
This is Samsara Island.

979
00:56:23,667 --> 00:56:26,201
This weekend
is about sisterhood

980
00:56:26,203 --> 00:56:30,472
and connecting
with the divine in all of us.

981
00:56:30,474 --> 00:56:34,775
So, I hope you'll all find
your bliss,

982
00:56:34,777 --> 00:56:38,746
starting with an all-paid
shopping spree

983
00:56:38,748 --> 00:56:40,815
at the fashion boutique!

984
00:56:46,323 --> 00:56:48,957
Come on! Come on!

985
00:56:51,794 --> 00:56:53,128
Bitch, I saw this first!

986
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:54,329
But you have ping pong tits!

987
00:56:54,331 --> 00:56:55,631
What about
your mosquito bites?

988
00:56:55,633 --> 00:56:57,299
No!
You know it's true!

989
00:56:57,301 --> 00:57:01,836
One more minute!
You keep what you can carry.

990
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:06,575
One more minute!
You keep what you can carry.

991
00:57:06,577 --> 00:57:10,811
Yeah, no one loves free stuff
more than rich people.

992
00:57:10,813 --> 00:57:12,547
Just the one dress for you?

993
00:57:12,549 --> 00:57:15,384
I don't wanna lose an arm.

994
00:57:15,386 --> 00:57:18,122
Ooh. Well, in that case,

995
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:23,127
one last touch.

996
00:57:31,035 --> 00:57:33,001
Well, isn't Nick a lucky guy.

997
00:57:33,003 --> 00:57:34,469
Time's up!

998
00:57:34,471 --> 00:57:36,972
Next stop... Spa!

999
00:57:43,681 --> 00:57:45,914
You're a genius.
You know that, right?

1000
00:57:45,916 --> 00:57:47,382
What's a best man for?

1001
00:57:47,384 --> 00:57:49,551
Guess that pilot's license
came in handy after all.

1002
00:57:49,553 --> 00:57:51,553
Here you go, champ.

1003
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:53,088
Oh, thank you, sir.

1004
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:55,457
Mmm. I think that is the best
beer I've ever had.

1005
00:57:55,459 --> 00:57:58,362
I'm gonna have to agree
with you on that.

1006
00:58:01,465 --> 00:58:03,065
You know,
if it wasn't for Araminta,

1007
00:58:03,067 --> 00:58:04,800
I'd ask you to marry me.

1008
00:58:07,338 --> 00:58:08,472
Although,

1009
00:58:10,774 --> 00:58:12,040
there is a little something

1010
00:58:12,042 --> 00:58:13,377
that might get
in the way of that.

1011
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,013
Mmm.

1012
00:58:18,015 --> 00:58:20,315
No!
Yeah.

1013
00:58:20,317 --> 00:58:22,784
Is that real?
Yes.

1014
00:58:22,786 --> 00:58:24,286
Wow! Yes!
Yes.

1015
00:58:24,288 --> 00:58:26,288
Yes, man! Congratulations!

1016
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:28,390
I know.
That is freaking amazing.

1017
00:58:28,392 --> 00:58:30,058
I'm ready.
You're ready.

1018
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:32,094
You're doing it.

1019
00:58:32,096 --> 00:58:34,129
Nick, I'm really happy
for you, man.

1020
00:58:34,131 --> 00:58:36,233
Thanks, dude.

1021
00:58:45,209 --> 00:58:47,676
I think my masseuse
just got me pregnant.

1022
00:58:53,117 --> 00:58:56,253
I can see why Nick put off
coming back to Singapore.

1023
00:58:56,855 --> 00:58:58,420
What do you mean?

1024
00:58:58,422 --> 00:59:01,656
You know, he was supposed
to come back last year,

1025
00:59:01,658 --> 00:59:03,692
take over the family business.

1026
00:59:03,694 --> 00:59:06,294
His parents freaked out
when he didn't.

1027
00:59:06,296 --> 00:59:10,867
But, now that he's back,
I'm sure all is forgiven.

1028
00:59:10,869 --> 00:59:12,567
But he's not back
for good.

1029
00:59:12,569 --> 00:59:14,605
I mean,
we're just here for a wedding.

1030
00:59:18,709 --> 00:59:20,310
Wow!

1031
00:59:21,812 --> 00:59:22,911
But?

1032
00:59:22,913 --> 00:59:25,213
No, I'm really happy for you.

1033
00:59:25,215 --> 00:59:27,282
Colin, I've known you
since you were in nappies.

1034
00:59:27,284 --> 00:59:29,818
I know when there's something
on your mind.

1035
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:32,521
Well, it wasn't
that long ago

1036
00:59:32,523 --> 00:59:35,991
that you were sure
you were moving back home.

1037
00:59:35,993 --> 00:59:40,063
And I mean, Rachel loves
her job in New York.

1038
00:59:41,031 --> 00:59:43,598
Yeah, we're gonna
figure that out.

1039
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,968
You're going to
figure it out. Right.

1040
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:49,571
Rachel, I get it.

1041
00:59:49,573 --> 00:59:51,139
It's hard knowing
where you stand

1042
00:59:51,141 --> 00:59:53,041
with someone
like Nicholas Young.

1043
00:59:53,043 --> 00:59:55,477
He has all that pressure
from his family.

1044
00:59:55,479 --> 00:59:59,714
Not just in business,
but in who he's dating.

1045
00:59:59,716 --> 01:00:01,650
It's like, you just never know

1046
01:00:01,652 --> 01:00:04,555
what's quite going on
in that gorgeous head of his.

1047
01:00:07,624 --> 01:00:10,893
Nick told you that
we were together, right?

1048
01:00:10,895 --> 01:00:13,328
It's ancient history now.

1049
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:16,866
Although our families,
particularly his mother,

1050
01:00:16,868 --> 01:00:20,101
always wanted us
to get married.

1051
01:00:20,103 --> 01:00:21,603
I guess we weren't ready then.

1052
01:00:21,605 --> 01:00:24,339
Dude, ever since
primary school,

1053
01:00:24,341 --> 01:00:26,208
you were always going to be

1054
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:28,844
the next chairman
of the Young Corporation,

1055
01:00:28,846 --> 01:00:30,979
your family's shining heir.

1056
01:00:30,981 --> 01:00:32,314
You really think
your family's going to

1057
01:00:32,316 --> 01:00:34,816
accept anything
less than that?

1058
01:00:34,818 --> 01:00:36,453
I mean, unless you...

1059
01:00:37,621 --> 01:00:38,787
No.

1060
01:00:40,057 --> 01:00:42,457
Are you thinking
of walking out?

1061
01:00:42,459 --> 01:00:45,193
Leaving everything
to bloody Alistair and Eddie?

1062
01:00:45,195 --> 01:00:47,295
I'm not walking out
on anything.

1063
01:00:47,297 --> 01:00:50,665
I met a girl, I fell in love
and I want to marry her.

1064
01:00:50,667 --> 01:00:53,502
And it can't just be
one thing or the other.

1065
01:00:53,504 --> 01:00:55,036
Uh... No, no, no.

1066
01:00:55,038 --> 01:00:58,340
It's not that simple.
You know that.

1067
01:00:58,342 --> 01:01:00,375
I really admire you.

1068
01:01:00,377 --> 01:01:03,812
It takes guts
coming all the way over here,

1069
01:01:03,814 --> 01:01:05,547
facing Nick's family.

1070
01:01:05,549 --> 01:01:09,852
Especially when Eleanor isn't
exactly in your corner.

1071
01:01:09,854 --> 01:01:12,387
Okay, your family aside,
have you ever thought about

1072
01:01:12,389 --> 01:01:14,656
what your relationship
with Rachel

1073
01:01:14,658 --> 01:01:17,225
will be like
if you got married?

1074
01:01:17,227 --> 01:01:18,627
I mean, okay,

1075
01:01:18,629 --> 01:01:20,662
you're Nicholas Young.
You're untouchable.

1076
01:01:20,664 --> 01:01:25,567
You always have been.
But Rachel's not.

1077
01:01:25,569 --> 01:01:28,703
And if she becomes
Mrs. Nicholas Young,

1078
01:01:28,705 --> 01:01:31,341
every day for her
is going to be a struggle.

1079
01:01:36,179 --> 01:01:40,515
I heard she told Tini
that Nick is a good catch.

1080
01:01:40,517 --> 01:01:43,418
So typical.
She's not even that pretty.

1081
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:46,821
It's like she's never heard
of plastic surgery.

1082
01:01:46,823 --> 01:01:48,425
Oh, shit.

1083
01:01:54,698 --> 01:01:56,097
Sorry.

1084
01:01:56,099 --> 01:01:57,768
You sure she's ready for that?

1085
01:02:06,577 --> 01:02:07,778
Rachel?

1086
01:02:15,452 --> 01:02:17,652
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.

1087
01:02:17,654 --> 01:02:20,155
Let's just forget
about those girls.

1088
01:02:20,157 --> 01:02:21,323
Camp out here

1089
01:02:21,325 --> 01:02:22,593
and order room service?

1090
01:02:34,171 --> 01:02:35,537
I'll call security.

1091
01:02:35,539 --> 01:02:36,607
No.

1092
01:02:38,842 --> 01:02:42,210
I'm not gonna make a scene.

1093
01:02:42,212 --> 01:02:44,681
I'm not gonna give them
the satisfaction.

1094
01:02:50,487 --> 01:02:54,122
This weekend was supposed
to be mani-pedis,

1095
01:02:54,124 --> 01:02:56,491
cocktails served
in pineapples.

1096
01:02:56,493 --> 01:02:58,861
This definitely wasn't
on the menu.

1097
01:02:58,863 --> 01:03:01,998
Why would Araminta even have
friends like that?

1098
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,665
They're so mean.

1099
01:03:03,667 --> 01:03:06,068
Well, you grow up
your whole lives together,

1100
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:07,771
you make excuses for people.

1101
01:03:08,906 --> 01:03:10,805
Specially the morons.

1102
01:03:10,807 --> 01:03:13,408
I mean, I know Michael didn't
have to deal with catty,

1103
01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:16,478
fish-killing sociopaths.

1104
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,916
How did you two
get through all this?

1105
01:03:20,617 --> 01:03:25,322
Well, I didn't have it quite
as bad, but it wasn't pretty.

1106
01:03:26,757 --> 01:03:30,059
Well, at least tell me
it gets better.

1107
01:03:30,061 --> 01:03:32,396
Of course it does.

1108
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:37,834
You okay?

1109
01:03:39,202 --> 01:03:40,570
Yeah.

1110
01:03:54,818 --> 01:03:58,789
Actually... No.

1111
01:04:04,828 --> 01:04:06,530
You could talk to me.

1112
01:04:14,138 --> 01:04:17,274
Michael is having an affair.

1113
01:04:25,983 --> 01:04:28,251
I'm really sorry, Astrid.

1114
01:04:57,848 --> 01:05:00,082
I thought I was here
to meet your family,

1115
01:05:00,084 --> 01:05:02,517
go to your best friend's
wedding, eat some good food.

1116
01:05:02,519 --> 01:05:05,420
Instead, I feel like I'm
a villain in a soap opera

1117
01:05:05,422 --> 01:05:08,658
who's plotting to steal
your family fortune.

1118
01:05:09,793 --> 01:05:11,595
What happened?

1119
01:05:12,429 --> 01:05:13,896
I mean, I met Amanda.

1120
01:05:13,898 --> 01:05:16,065
She told me
that everyone here thinks

1121
01:05:16,067 --> 01:05:17,265
that I'm the evil person

1122
01:05:17,267 --> 01:05:18,633
that prevented you
from moving back

1123
01:05:18,635 --> 01:05:20,002
to Singapore last year,

1124
01:05:20,004 --> 01:05:21,203
when I didn't even know

1125
01:05:21,205 --> 01:05:23,371
you were supposed
to come home.

1126
01:05:23,373 --> 01:05:25,473
You have every reason
to be upset.

1127
01:05:25,475 --> 01:05:26,909
I'm not done yet.

1128
01:05:26,911 --> 01:05:30,913
There was also this gutted,
bloody fish

1129
01:05:30,915 --> 01:05:33,149
that Araminta's friends
left for me

1130
01:05:33,151 --> 01:05:34,449
in my hotel room

1131
01:05:34,451 --> 01:05:36,351
on my bed next to the words,

1132
01:05:36,353 --> 01:05:39,387
"Catch this,
you gold-digging bitch."

1133
01:05:39,389 --> 01:05:42,423
Written in big,
fat serial-killer letters.

1134
01:05:42,425 --> 01:05:44,692
Is that all that happened?

1135
01:05:44,694 --> 01:05:46,761
I mean, please tell me
that's all that happened.

1136
01:05:46,763 --> 01:05:48,296
You know what?
I don't even care

1137
01:05:48,298 --> 01:05:49,564
about those stupid girls

1138
01:05:49,566 --> 01:05:51,432
with their stupid little
designer handbags

1139
01:05:51,434 --> 01:05:52,734
and sunglasses.
I don't care about that.

1140
01:05:52,736 --> 01:05:54,236
I don't care
that your ex-girlfriend

1141
01:05:54,238 --> 01:05:55,570
told me all this crap.

1142
01:05:55,572 --> 01:05:56,941
It's that you didn't
tell me any of it.

1143
01:05:57,841 --> 01:05:58,908
I screwed up.

1144
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:00,209
Why? Were you trying
to test me?

1145
01:06:00,211 --> 01:06:01,543
I really
messed up, okay?

1146
01:06:01,545 --> 01:06:03,212
Why would you do that?
I made a mistake.

1147
01:06:03,214 --> 01:06:06,882
When we first met,
you had no idea who I was,

1148
01:06:06,884 --> 01:06:08,918
who my family were.
You didn't care!

1149
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:11,820
Yeah, I don't care
about that stupid stuff.

1150
01:06:11,822 --> 01:06:14,056
Well, exactly.

1151
01:06:14,058 --> 01:06:17,026
You are so different
from all of the women

1152
01:06:17,028 --> 01:06:18,595
that I grew up with.

1153
01:06:19,931 --> 01:06:22,599
And I love who I am
around you.

1154
01:06:24,202 --> 01:06:27,402
I don't want that to change.

1155
01:06:27,404 --> 01:06:31,106
And that's selfish, I know.
Mmm-hmm.

1156
01:06:31,108 --> 01:06:33,476
I'm sorry that you had to deal
with that on your own.

1157
01:06:36,314 --> 01:06:38,746
But I'm here now.

1158
01:06:38,748 --> 01:06:41,250
Whatever happens,
we'll get through it together.

1159
01:06:41,252 --> 01:06:43,087
Dead fish and all.

1160
01:06:44,322 --> 01:06:46,021
All right?

1161
01:06:46,023 --> 01:06:47,457
It was so gross.

1162
01:06:48,592 --> 01:06:50,061
But I buried it.

1163
01:06:53,097 --> 01:06:54,395
You dealt with it.

1164
01:06:56,133 --> 01:06:57,667
Come here.

1165
01:07:01,605 --> 01:07:03,205
You know what? We need to do
something tonight.

1166
01:07:03,207 --> 01:07:05,341
We need to do something
that's just you and me, okay?

1167
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:07,109
100% agree.
Yes.

1168
01:07:07,111 --> 01:07:11,681
But we do have to go
make some dumplings first.

1169
01:07:12,749 --> 01:07:13,648
Okay?

1170
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:14,884
And can we eat them?

1171
01:07:14,886 --> 01:07:16,285
We can eat
as many as you like.

1172
01:07:16,287 --> 01:07:17,552
Okay, fine.

1173
01:07:44,282 --> 01:07:45,747
This is too much.

1174
01:07:45,749 --> 01:07:48,083
We're hosting
a rehearsal dinner,

1175
01:07:48,085 --> 01:07:50,119
not feeding an army.

1176
01:07:50,121 --> 01:07:52,756
Better too many than have
people say we're stingy.

1177
01:07:53,891 --> 01:07:56,158
So, right.

1178
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,894
You put the baby in bed.

1179
01:07:58,896 --> 01:08:04,066
You tuck, tuck, tuck.
Same on the other side.

1180
01:08:04,068 --> 01:08:06,402
You give him
a kiss good night.

1181
01:08:06,404 --> 01:08:08,037
That's so cute.

1182
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:09,905
How's that?
And then you eat the baby.

1183
01:08:09,907 --> 01:08:12,141
Then you eat the baby
after he's cooked.

1184
01:08:12,143 --> 01:08:13,876
No, you gotta
make sure he's cooked.

1185
01:08:13,878 --> 01:08:15,177
Did your Ah Ma teach you that?

1186
01:08:15,179 --> 01:08:16,946
She did.

1187
01:08:16,948 --> 01:08:18,546
I, on the other hand,

1188
01:08:18,548 --> 01:08:20,249
was taught
by Grand-Auntie Mabel.

1189
01:08:20,251 --> 01:08:22,550
You put the Botox in the face,

1190
01:08:22,552 --> 01:08:25,888
and then
you pinch, pinch, pinch.

1191
01:08:25,890 --> 01:08:28,623
Then, voila!

1192
01:08:28,625 --> 01:08:30,692
Did you guys all learn
when you were kids?

1193
01:08:30,694 --> 01:08:31,961
We didn't have a choice.

1194
01:08:31,963 --> 01:08:33,728
We taught you so you'd know

1195
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:35,663
the blood, sweat,
and tears it took

1196
01:08:35,665 --> 01:08:37,465
to raise and feed you monkeys.

1197
01:08:37,467 --> 01:08:38,867
Not like the ang-mohs

1198
01:08:38,869 --> 01:08:40,768
microwaving macaroni
and cheese

1199
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:42,004
for their own children.

1200
01:08:42,006 --> 01:08:43,838
No wonder
they put their parents

1201
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:45,908
in the old folks' home
when they all grow up.

1202
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:47,376
I know!

1203
01:08:47,378 --> 01:08:50,379
Ah Ma says if we don't pass
traditions down like this,

1204
01:08:50,381 --> 01:08:52,147
they'll disappear.

1205
01:08:52,149 --> 01:08:54,482
God forbid, we lose
the ancient Chinese tradition

1206
01:08:54,484 --> 01:08:56,051
of guilting your children.

1207
01:08:57,355 --> 01:08:58,720
It's totally worth it.

1208
01:08:58,722 --> 01:09:00,389
Mother used to wait for me
after school

1209
01:09:00,391 --> 01:09:02,391
with a nice basket of these.

1210
01:09:06,496 --> 01:09:09,497
Hey, I never got
after-school dumplings.

1211
01:09:09,499 --> 01:09:10,866
Well, that's because
Auntie Felicity

1212
01:09:10,868 --> 01:09:13,202
was doing after-school
microdermabrasion.

1213
01:09:21,644 --> 01:09:24,545
Auntie, this is Dolce.

1214
01:09:24,547 --> 01:09:26,382
You speak Cantonese?

1215
01:09:26,384 --> 01:09:28,117
No, I don't.

1216
01:09:28,119 --> 01:09:31,619
It's just great seeing
you guys all like this.

1217
01:09:31,621 --> 01:09:33,055
When I was growing up,

1218
01:09:33,057 --> 01:09:35,958
it was just me and my mom,
which I loved.

1219
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:38,760
But we didn't really have
a big family like this.

1220
01:09:38,762 --> 01:09:40,496
It's really nice.

1221
01:09:40,498 --> 01:09:42,998
Oh, that's so lovely
of you to say, Rachel.

1222
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,602
We are all very lucky
to have each other.

1223
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:50,671
That's a beautiful ring,
Auntie Eleanor.

1224
01:09:50,673 --> 01:09:53,108
I've never seen
anything like it.

1225
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:56,178
Nick's father had it made
when he proposed to me.

1226
01:09:56,180 --> 01:10:00,215
That's very romantic.
How did you guys meet?

1227
01:10:00,217 --> 01:10:02,251
Actually, they met
at Cambridge.

1228
01:10:02,253 --> 01:10:03,986
They were both
studying law together.

1229
01:10:03,988 --> 01:10:05,586
Oh, I didn't know
you were a lawyer.

1230
01:10:05,588 --> 01:10:07,555
I wasn't.
I withdrew from university

1231
01:10:07,557 --> 01:10:08,991
when we got married.

1232
01:10:08,993 --> 01:10:10,159
Oh.

1233
01:10:10,161 --> 01:10:12,294
I chose to help my husband
run a business

1234
01:10:12,296 --> 01:10:13,862
and to raise a family.

1235
01:10:13,864 --> 01:10:16,465
For me, it was a privilege.

1236
01:10:16,467 --> 01:10:19,003
But for you, you may think
it's old-fashioned.

1237
01:10:20,171 --> 01:10:22,905
It's nice
you appreciate this house

1238
01:10:22,907 --> 01:10:25,706
and us being here together
wrapping dumplings.

1239
01:10:25,708 --> 01:10:28,310
But all this
doesn't just happen.

1240
01:10:28,312 --> 01:10:31,013
It's because we know
to put family first,

1241
01:10:31,015 --> 01:10:33,817
instead of chasing
one's passion.

1242
01:10:40,590 --> 01:10:42,026
Ah Ma...

1243
01:10:43,394 --> 01:10:44,526
Thank you.

1244
01:10:44,528 --> 01:10:46,161
Oh, Nick.

1245
01:10:46,163 --> 01:10:47,429
Come and sit.

1246
01:11:01,579 --> 01:11:03,646
Mmm.

1247
01:11:04,081 --> 01:11:05,382
Mmm.

1248
01:11:47,591 --> 01:11:51,293
Oh, hi.
I think I'm a little lost.

1249
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,829
This house is pretty big.

1250
01:11:55,866 --> 01:11:57,933
I'm glad I found you.

1251
01:11:57,935 --> 01:12:00,536
I am afraid
that I've been unfair.

1252
01:12:00,538 --> 01:12:01,904
Oh, no, you know what?

1253
01:12:01,906 --> 01:12:03,804
I'm sorry
I made an assumption.

1254
01:12:03,806 --> 01:12:05,307
I didn't mean to offend you.

1255
01:12:05,309 --> 01:12:06,310
Not at all.

1256
01:12:07,578 --> 01:12:09,912
You asked about my ring.

1257
01:12:09,914 --> 01:12:12,881
The truth is
Nick's father had it made

1258
01:12:12,883 --> 01:12:15,484
when he wanted
to propose to me

1259
01:12:15,486 --> 01:12:18,887
because Ah Ma wouldn't
give him the family ring.

1260
01:12:18,889 --> 01:12:21,523
I wasn't her first choice.

1261
01:12:21,525 --> 01:12:25,427
Honestly, I wasn't her second.

1262
01:12:25,429 --> 01:12:28,696
Gosh, I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.

1263
01:12:28,698 --> 01:12:30,798
I didn't come
from the right family,

1264
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,401
have the right connections.

1265
01:12:32,403 --> 01:12:34,002
And Ah Ma thought
I would not make

1266
01:12:34,004 --> 01:12:35,637
an adequate wife to her son.

1267
01:12:35,639 --> 01:12:38,708
But she came around,
obviously.

1268
01:12:41,312 --> 01:12:43,844
It took many years,

1269
01:12:43,846 --> 01:12:46,648
and she had good reason
to be concerned.

1270
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:49,784
Because I had no idea
the work

1271
01:12:49,786 --> 01:12:52,820
and the sacrifice
it would take.

1272
01:12:52,822 --> 01:12:55,057
There were many days
when I wondered

1273
01:12:55,059 --> 01:12:58,160
if I would ever measure up.

1274
01:12:58,162 --> 01:13:00,830
But having been through
it all,

1275
01:13:01,798 --> 01:13:03,833
I know this much.

1276
01:13:09,506 --> 01:13:12,076
You will never be enough.

1277
01:13:16,313 --> 01:13:20,783
We should head back.
I wouldn't want Nick to worry.

1278
01:13:36,367 --> 01:13:37,800
You all right?

1279
01:13:38,502 --> 01:13:39,503
Yeah.

1280
01:13:42,273 --> 01:13:44,072
I know my mum
can be tough at times,

1281
01:13:44,074 --> 01:13:48,776
but there isn't anything
she wouldn't do for me.

1282
01:13:48,778 --> 01:13:52,381
And there is a reason why
I lived with Ah Ma growing up.

1283
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:55,816
It's because my mother knew
she wasn't the favorite.

1284
01:13:55,818 --> 01:13:59,356
So she let her raise me,
so I would be.

1285
01:14:00,891 --> 01:14:02,891
You were just a kid?

1286
01:14:02,893 --> 01:14:05,160
Yeah.

1287
01:14:05,162 --> 01:14:09,832
But it's hard to understand
from the outside.

1288
01:14:12,102 --> 01:14:15,170
But she did what she thought
was best for the family.

1289
01:14:15,172 --> 01:14:17,408
Mmm-hmm.
For everyone involved.

1290
01:14:19,543 --> 01:14:22,411
Anyway, I think I've had
enough with dumplings

1291
01:14:22,413 --> 01:14:24,845
for the rest of my life.

1292
01:14:24,847 --> 01:14:26,615
What should we do?

1293
01:14:26,617 --> 01:14:30,054
Sushi, movies,
anything you like. Really.

1294
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:34,556
Wait, what?

1295
01:14:34,558 --> 01:14:37,526
Was she like, "You will never
be good enough for my son"?

1296
01:14:37,528 --> 01:14:39,995
Or was it like, "You...

1297
01:14:39,997 --> 01:14:42,232
"You will never be good enough
for my son"?

1298
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,000
It's like the second one.
Oh.

1299
01:14:45,002 --> 01:14:46,834
Except for in a way
that made me wanna cry

1300
01:14:46,836 --> 01:14:48,070
and puke at the same time.

1301
01:14:48,072 --> 01:14:50,405
Gosh, she's so badass.

1302
01:14:50,407 --> 01:14:51,873
You know,
I bet if you told her

1303
01:14:51,875 --> 01:14:53,408
you'd leave Nick
for a million dollars,

1304
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:55,477
she will write that check.
They do that around here.

1305
01:14:55,479 --> 01:14:57,813
And she looked at me
like I was nothing.

1306
01:14:57,815 --> 01:14:59,181
Like a $10 million check.

1307
01:14:59,183 --> 01:15:00,482
I feel like she would do that.

1308
01:15:00,484 --> 01:15:02,484
I don't even know
what I should do.

1309
01:15:02,486 --> 01:15:05,354
I mean, I can't even tell Nick
because he worships her.

1310
01:15:05,356 --> 01:15:07,589
Yeah, Chinese sons
think their moms

1311
01:15:07,591 --> 01:15:09,424
fart Chanel No. 5.

1312
01:15:09,426 --> 01:15:12,527
What about the Ah Ma?
Does she hate your face, too?

1313
01:15:12,529 --> 01:15:15,330
Okay, nobody said
they hated my face.

1314
01:15:15,332 --> 01:15:20,402
And Ah Ma, she liked my face.
She said I had a lucky nose.

1315
01:15:20,404 --> 01:15:21,636
That's great!

1316
01:15:21,638 --> 01:15:23,372
You know, Eleanor can hate you
all day long,

1317
01:15:23,374 --> 01:15:26,808
but you can't beat 2,000 years
of Chinese filial piety.

1318
01:15:26,810 --> 01:15:29,311
I feel like I shouldn't
even go to the wedding.

1319
01:15:29,313 --> 01:15:31,413
You know,
it's Colin and Araminta's day.

1320
01:15:31,415 --> 01:15:32,914
I don't wanna cause
any drama there.

1321
01:15:32,916 --> 01:15:35,817
I feel like I should just
sit it out.

1322
01:15:35,819 --> 01:15:38,956
You know? Tell Nick I had
food poisoning or something.

1323
01:15:41,825 --> 01:15:43,992
What?
That's bullshit.

1324
01:15:43,994 --> 01:15:45,794
You're just scared.
No, I'm not.

1325
01:15:45,796 --> 01:15:49,064
Okay, here's what you need to
understand. All right?

1326
01:15:49,066 --> 01:15:51,166
It's not about getting Eleanor
to like you.

1327
01:15:51,168 --> 01:15:54,202
It's about getting her
to respect you, all right?

1328
01:15:54,204 --> 01:15:57,305
Right now, she just thinks
you're some undeserving,

1329
01:15:57,307 --> 01:16:00,308
clueless, gold-digging...
Yeah, I got it.

1330
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:03,412
...trashy, unrefined banana.

1331
01:16:03,414 --> 01:16:05,914
Yellow on the outside,
white on the inside.

1332
01:16:05,916 --> 01:16:08,116
I know what a banana is.

1333
01:16:08,118 --> 01:16:10,652
When, in reality, you're
a super sophisticated, smart

1334
01:16:10,654 --> 01:16:13,355
professor of
freaking game theory.

1335
01:16:13,357 --> 01:16:15,359
Show her that side of you,
you know?

1336
01:16:15,993 --> 01:16:17,058
You're right.

1337
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:18,260
Damn straight, I'm right.

1338
01:16:18,262 --> 01:16:20,028
It's Peik Lin,
I'm always right.

1339
01:16:20,030 --> 01:16:21,296
Yeah, she's like
trying to play

1340
01:16:21,298 --> 01:16:23,031
a game of chicken with me.

1341
01:16:23,033 --> 01:16:25,200
Where she's like coming at me,
and thinking

1342
01:16:25,202 --> 01:16:26,701
I'm going to swerve
like a chicken.

1343
01:16:26,703 --> 01:16:27,969
But you can't swerve.

1344
01:16:27,971 --> 01:16:29,371
I'm not gonna swerve.
Not for her.

1345
01:16:29,373 --> 01:16:31,139
No.
Chickens are bitches, dude!

1346
01:16:31,141 --> 01:16:33,175
And I'm not a chicken.
You're not a chicken.

1347
01:16:33,177 --> 01:16:34,609
You're gonna roll up
to that wedding,

1348
01:16:34,611 --> 01:16:36,478
you're gonna be like,
"Bak-bak, bitch!"

1349
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:37,546
Bak-bak, bitch!

1350
01:16:37,548 --> 01:16:39,981
Chickens are bitches.

1351
01:16:39,983 --> 01:16:42,083
Sorry, Uncle.

1352
01:16:42,085 --> 01:16:43,418
What are you doing tonight?

1353
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:45,787
I was gonna go to FedEx
or something.

1354
01:16:45,789 --> 01:16:48,223
Why? Oh!

1355
01:16:48,225 --> 01:16:51,193
I have been waiting to
do this properly for so long.

1356
01:16:51,195 --> 01:16:53,395
I'm thinking eyebrow triage,
root crimps,

1357
01:16:53,397 --> 01:16:54,897
maybe some eyelid tape.

1358
01:16:54,899 --> 01:16:56,965
What do you think?

1359
01:16:56,967 --> 01:16:58,667
Ugh. All of it.

1360
01:16:58,669 --> 01:17:01,470
And I would throw in
a Korean snail face mask.

1361
01:17:01,472 --> 01:17:05,140
Sweetie, your skin is so dry,
it's hurting my face.

1362
01:17:05,142 --> 01:17:06,374
Thank you.

1363
01:17:06,376 --> 01:17:07,877
You know, it's about time

1364
01:17:07,879 --> 01:17:09,778
someone stood up
to Auntie Eleanor.

1365
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:11,213
Well, you, not me. Oh, God!

1366
01:17:11,215 --> 01:17:12,614
She can't know
I was ever here.

1367
01:17:12,616 --> 01:17:13,950
Oh, no.

1368
01:17:13,952 --> 01:17:17,519
Right. Well, okay, let's get
to work. Cappuccinos.

1369
01:17:28,599 --> 01:17:31,032
Pull the plum Balenciaga,
the peach Chloe,

1370
01:17:31,034 --> 01:17:33,435
the Giambattista,
all the Bottegas.

1371
01:17:33,437 --> 01:17:35,737
Oh, and that Jason Wu with
the deconstructed ruffles.

1372
01:17:35,739 --> 01:17:37,439
And a sandwich for Peik Lin.

1373
01:17:37,441 --> 01:17:40,375
Oh! Okay. All right.
Oh. Right.

1374
01:17:40,377 --> 01:17:41,643
I'm not sure if it's working

1375
01:17:41,645 --> 01:17:45,180
or if she looks like
a clown's tampon.

1376
01:17:45,182 --> 01:17:46,983
On a heavy day.

1377
01:17:46,985 --> 01:17:48,817
You look like a flower.

1378
01:17:48,819 --> 01:17:52,922
A sad, lonely flower
no one wants to be around.

1379
01:17:56,593 --> 01:17:58,493
I mean, it's the wedding
of the century.

1380
01:17:58,495 --> 01:18:00,531
So, of course, we're here.
It's the natural...

1381
01:18:01,598 --> 01:18:03,534
Oh!

1382
01:18:04,234 --> 01:18:08,603
It's not that bad.

1383
01:18:08,605 --> 01:18:10,338
It's holding you up.

1384
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:12,574
It's a hands-on dress.
You know what I mean?

1385
01:18:12,576 --> 01:18:13,710
Incoming.

1386
01:18:14,511 --> 01:18:15,546
Okay.

1387
01:18:20,050 --> 01:18:21,550
I love my fans.

1388
01:18:21,552 --> 01:18:23,953
Taipei Tiger 2 is going
to redefine the genre.

1389
01:18:23,955 --> 01:18:26,588
She's a star. She's a star.
TT2, honey.

1390
01:18:26,590 --> 01:18:27,556
Oh!

1391
01:18:27,558 --> 01:18:29,157
I'm blinded by the light.

1392
01:18:29,159 --> 01:18:30,725
This is why disco died.

1393
01:18:30,727 --> 01:18:32,995
You kind of look
like a slutty Ebola virus.

1394
01:18:32,997 --> 01:18:36,731
It's like a bag of Skittles.
Taste the rainbow.

1395
01:18:36,733 --> 01:18:37,766
Could work if we...

1396
01:18:37,768 --> 01:18:39,668
Yes. I think
we just ought to...

1397
01:18:39,670 --> 01:18:42,837
I just think if we could tell
her this is coming from you

1398
01:18:42,839 --> 01:18:44,941
'cause she probably doesn't
want to hear it from a guy.

1399
01:18:44,943 --> 01:18:46,042
Okay. Okay.

1400
01:18:47,578 --> 01:18:49,912
Okay, remember.
Optimal angles.

1401
01:19:06,096 --> 01:19:07,964
Just right here!
Just right here!

1402
01:19:17,641 --> 01:19:18,742
Ma'am.

1403
01:19:28,385 --> 01:19:30,552
Everyone, I've got
Rachel Chu of New York.

1404
01:19:30,554 --> 01:19:32,356
Rachel Chu of New York.

1405
01:19:36,894 --> 01:19:38,760
Rachel! Rachel! To me!

1406
01:19:38,762 --> 01:19:41,262
Okay, ladies, looking good.

1407
01:19:41,264 --> 01:19:42,697
Out of the way, please.
Out of the way.

1408
01:19:42,699 --> 01:19:45,467
So gorgeous!
Thank you.

1409
01:19:45,469 --> 01:19:47,137
Ladies, move, please.
Out of the way!

1410
01:19:48,472 --> 01:19:51,241
Good, that's great.
Beautiful dress.

1411
01:19:51,909 --> 01:19:53,443
Ladies.

1412
01:19:55,579 --> 01:19:56,544
Amanda.

1413
01:19:56,546 --> 01:19:59,349
Mmm.
You're in my way.

1414
01:20:02,386 --> 01:20:04,721
Okay, what?

1415
01:20:07,557 --> 01:20:10,225
Our Chinese investors
are getting nervous.

1416
01:20:10,227 --> 01:20:12,260
I have to fly in to Shenzhen
on Monday

1417
01:20:12,262 --> 01:20:14,964
to try and talk them down.

1418
01:20:14,966 --> 01:20:16,868
That's Cassian's birthday.

1419
01:20:18,102 --> 01:20:20,435
Yeah, I know.

1420
01:20:20,437 --> 01:20:25,674
I hate to miss it,
but this is important.

1421
01:20:25,676 --> 01:20:28,576
You'd think your son's
birthday's important.

1422
01:20:28,578 --> 01:20:30,412
Get someone else to handle it.

1423
01:20:34,751 --> 01:20:39,423
Unless there's another reason
you're out of town?

1424
01:20:41,159 --> 01:20:43,226
What are you saying?

1425
01:20:52,202 --> 01:20:54,170
I know
you're having an affair.

1426
01:20:54,172 --> 01:20:56,271
Oh, Jesus. Astrid.

1427
01:20:56,273 --> 01:20:58,740
Let's just
get through the wedding,

1428
01:20:58,742 --> 01:21:00,442
and we'll deal with it after.

1429
01:21:00,444 --> 01:21:02,612
I don't wanna make a scene.

1430
01:21:06,216 --> 01:21:07,883
You find out
I'm having an affair

1431
01:21:07,885 --> 01:21:08,984
with another woman,

1432
01:21:08,986 --> 01:21:11,586
and you're worried
about making a scene?

1433
01:21:11,588 --> 01:21:14,489
You'd rather I scream
and carry on?

1434
01:21:14,491 --> 01:21:18,259
Yes. Honestly,
I wish you would.

1435
01:21:18,261 --> 01:21:20,963
It would show you cared about
more than what people thought

1436
01:21:20,965 --> 01:21:23,498
of you and your family.

1437
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,633
Don't try and turn this on me.

1438
01:21:25,635 --> 01:21:27,903
I'm not the one
who screwed up!

1439
01:21:27,905 --> 01:21:29,237
Of course not.

1440
01:21:29,239 --> 01:21:31,406
You're always the prettiest,

1441
01:21:31,408 --> 01:21:33,575
richest, most perfect girl
in the room.

1442
01:21:33,577 --> 01:21:35,044
While I'm just
this lucky bastard

1443
01:21:35,046 --> 01:21:36,377
who will never measure up.

1444
01:21:36,379 --> 01:21:37,779
Don't say that.

1445
01:21:37,781 --> 01:21:39,814
I know
what you're thinking, Astrid.

1446
01:21:39,816 --> 01:21:41,884
That's why
you hide your shoes,

1447
01:21:41,886 --> 01:21:43,284
the jewelry you buy,

1448
01:21:43,286 --> 01:21:46,356
as if every minute of my life
I'm not reminded of it.

1449
01:21:47,424 --> 01:21:49,992
I'm just tired.

1450
01:21:49,994 --> 01:21:53,561
I'm tired of having nothing
I do matter.

1451
01:21:53,563 --> 01:21:56,065
Including having the affair.

1452
01:21:56,067 --> 01:22:00,002
Of course
what you do matters!

1453
01:22:00,004 --> 01:22:03,338
How can you say that?

1454
01:22:31,202 --> 01:22:33,869
Is this a church
or a paddy field?

1455
01:22:33,871 --> 01:22:36,304
They spent 40 million
on the wedding.

1456
01:22:36,306 --> 01:22:38,007
Really? That's too much.

1457
01:22:38,009 --> 01:22:40,142
We're Methodists.
20 million is our limit.

1458
01:22:40,144 --> 01:22:41,243
I know.

1459
01:22:41,245 --> 01:22:45,147
Princess Intan. Vicious woman.

1460
01:22:45,149 --> 01:22:48,716
I heard she demanded
a whole row to herself,

1461
01:22:48,718 --> 01:22:51,220
so she wouldn't be bothered
by anyone.

1462
01:22:51,222 --> 01:22:52,455
Really?

1463
01:22:55,792 --> 01:22:57,494
Who is that?

1464
01:23:10,841 --> 01:23:12,109
Aunties.

1465
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:17,213
Rachel, how lovely to see you.

1466
01:23:17,215 --> 01:23:18,983
The pleasure is all mine.

1467
01:23:20,417 --> 01:23:22,920
I'm sorry,
our row is full.

1468
01:23:31,494 --> 01:23:33,965
I love it.

1469
01:23:37,935 --> 01:23:41,369
Bak-bak. Okay.

1470
01:23:49,813 --> 01:23:53,481
Princess Intan. Rachel Chu.

1471
01:23:53,483 --> 01:23:56,118
I read your great article
about microloans

1472
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:57,752
in the
Asian Economics Journal.

1473
01:23:57,754 --> 01:24:00,189
I received so much criticism

1474
01:24:00,191 --> 01:24:01,857
about that article.

1475
01:24:01,859 --> 01:24:04,692
Well, you know what? I think
your critics missed the point.

1476
01:24:04,694 --> 01:24:07,162
'Cause your microloans
helped women,

1477
01:24:07,164 --> 01:24:09,133
and women lift up economies.

1478
01:24:10,567 --> 01:24:13,102
What was your name, again?

1479
01:24:13,104 --> 01:24:14,535
Rachel Chu.

1480
01:24:14,537 --> 01:24:16,305
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1481
01:24:16,307 --> 01:24:18,207
Now, what brings you here?

1482
01:24:18,209 --> 01:24:19,741
I followed a boy...

1483
01:24:24,015 --> 01:24:25,381
Ah Ma is here.

1484
01:24:25,383 --> 01:24:27,684
She never comes
to these things.

1485
01:24:51,441 --> 01:24:52,740
How are you feeling?

1486
01:24:52,742 --> 01:24:54,343
Good.
All right. Don't be nervous.

1487
01:24:54,345 --> 01:24:55,878
I'm not nervous.
You look great.

1488
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:57,478
Thank you.

1489
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:00,349
Hey, Rachel's not sitting
with your family.

1490
01:25:00,351 --> 01:25:02,051
Yeah. I don't blame her.

1491
01:25:02,053 --> 01:25:04,853
Mother hasn't exactly been
the most welcoming.

1492
01:25:04,855 --> 01:25:08,690
But I'm sure she'll be at
the back somewhere laying low.

1493
01:25:08,692 --> 01:25:12,595
No. She's right at the front.
Take a look.

1494
01:25:19,937 --> 01:25:22,239
I think you've got a fighter.

1495
01:25:26,810 --> 01:25:29,612
Guys, it's time.

1496
01:25:30,414 --> 01:25:33,182
Okay.
All right.

1497
01:25:33,184 --> 01:25:34,782
Hey.
Yeah?

1498
01:25:34,784 --> 01:25:36,418
Make sure
she doesn't take your balls.

1499
01:25:38,222 --> 01:25:39,787
Just joking. Just joking.

1500
01:25:39,789 --> 01:25:41,756
Thanks for dressing up,
Bernard.

1501
01:25:41,758 --> 01:25:43,558
Hey. It's not about me.

1502
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:45,560
Yeah. Come on.
Thanks, Bernard.

1503
01:25:45,562 --> 01:25:48,063
It's not about me.
All right.

01:29:25,449 --> 01:29:28,350
It's the double Spanx.
I can't breathe.

1524
01:29:28,352 --> 01:29:32,289
It's not the clothes.
It's just you.

1525
01:29:33,591 --> 01:29:35,457
Uh, excuse me.

1526
01:29:35,459 --> 01:29:38,093
This party isn't gonna
dance itself. Come on.

1527
01:29:38,095 --> 01:29:40,529
Come on, Nicki-Nick.
All right.

1528
01:29:40,531 --> 01:29:42,164
You're very good.

1529
01:29:42,166 --> 01:29:43,398
Yeah? I only stepped on her twice.
Very.

1530
01:30:03,954 --> 01:30:05,420
Oliver.

1531
01:30:05,422 --> 01:30:07,256
Yes, Auntie?

1532
01:30:07,258 --> 01:30:09,024
Be a dear
and take care of that.

1533
01:30:12,363 --> 01:30:14,963
As you wish.

1534
01:30:25,808 --> 01:30:28,912
You know, you should wear
a tux more often.

1535
01:30:29,846 --> 01:30:32,581
Like, all the time?

1536
01:30:32,583 --> 01:30:34,316
Mmm, yeah.

1537
01:30:34,318 --> 01:30:37,386
You know, when you're
playing basketball at the Y,

1538
01:30:37,388 --> 01:30:40,524
shaving, brushing your teeth.

1539
01:30:49,366 --> 01:30:51,667
Alistair, your father's
looking for you.

1540
01:30:51,669 --> 01:30:54,972
Something about an overdrawn
discretionary account.

1541
01:30:55,606 --> 01:30:57,306
Oh, my God.

1542
01:30:57,308 --> 01:30:59,908
Baby! Oh, my gosh!

1543
01:31:01,011 --> 01:31:02,744
Oh. Hi.

1544
01:31:02,746 --> 01:31:05,447
So, how do you like
the wedding?

1545
01:31:05,449 --> 01:31:09,384
Oh, my gosh!
It's so glamorous!

1546
01:31:09,386 --> 01:31:11,753
When it's Alistair's
and my wedding,

1547
01:31:11,755 --> 01:31:14,056
I want it
just like this.

1548
01:31:14,058 --> 01:31:18,493
No, no, no! I want it big!
Big! Better!

1549
01:31:18,495 --> 01:31:20,362
Sweetie!

1550
01:31:20,364 --> 01:31:22,431
You'll be lucky
if Alistair's parents

1551
01:31:22,433 --> 01:31:24,466
give you a tea ceremony.

1552
01:31:24,468 --> 01:31:26,435
You know Alistair's
only the fourth son

1553
01:31:26,437 --> 01:31:28,203
of a penny-pinching family,
don't you?

1554
01:31:28,205 --> 01:31:30,205
I mean, he'll get
next to nothing.

1555
01:31:30,207 --> 01:31:31,707
You want a wedding like this?

1556
01:31:31,709 --> 01:31:34,142
You should've fallen in love
with an only child.

1557
01:31:34,144 --> 01:31:35,579
Someone like...

1558
01:31:37,414 --> 01:31:39,114
Bernard Tai.

1559
01:31:43,454 --> 01:31:45,354
Master Nicholas,

1560
01:31:45,356 --> 01:31:46,888
your grandmother would like

1561
01:31:46,890 --> 01:31:49,059
to speak to you
and Miss Rachel.

1562
01:31:51,628 --> 01:31:53,297
Okay.

1563
01:31:53,997 --> 01:31:55,364
Sick party.

1564
01:31:55,366 --> 01:31:56,367
Yeah!

1565
01:31:57,868 --> 01:31:59,169
Hold that.

1566
01:32:11,548 --> 01:32:12,781
Ah Ma, Mum,

1567
01:32:12,783 --> 01:32:15,018
what's all this about?

1568
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:31,032
Ah Ma!

1569
01:32:31,034 --> 01:32:32,467
I'm sorry to tell you,

1570
01:32:32,469 --> 01:32:34,035
but Rachel has been lying
to us about her family

1571
01:32:34,037 --> 01:32:35,303
and her mother.

1572
01:32:35,305 --> 01:32:36,505
What are... What are you
talking about?

1573
01:32:36,507 --> 01:32:38,273
I hired
a private investigator...

1574
01:32:38,275 --> 01:32:40,142
Mom, you didn't.
...to look into her past.

1575
01:32:40,144 --> 01:32:41,476
She said her father
passed away in China...

1576
01:32:41,478 --> 01:32:42,611
Mum!

1577
01:32:42,613 --> 01:32:44,012
...but that's not true.

1578
01:32:44,014 --> 01:32:46,415
Your mother's husband
is very much alive.

1579
01:32:46,417 --> 01:32:48,550
During her marriage,
she cheated on him

1580
01:32:48,552 --> 01:32:50,685
and became pregnant
with another man's child.

1581
01:32:50,687 --> 01:32:53,455
And before he found out,
she ran away to America.

1582
01:32:53,457 --> 01:32:55,190
It's all in here.
You had no right!

1583
01:32:55,192 --> 01:32:56,859
We had every right!
You did not!

1584
01:32:56,861 --> 01:32:58,093
You're lying!

1585
01:32:58,095 --> 01:32:59,094
Do you have any idea
the scandal

1586
01:32:59,096 --> 01:33:00,429
this would have caused

1587
01:33:00,431 --> 01:33:02,433
for Rachel to hide
something like this?

1588
01:33:04,869 --> 01:33:06,668
She wouldn't have.

1589
01:33:06,670 --> 01:33:10,474
We cannot be linked
to this sort of family.

1590
01:33:15,179 --> 01:33:17,012
I don't want
any part of your family.

1591
01:33:17,014 --> 01:33:18,248
Rachel.

1592
01:33:22,219 --> 01:33:23,385
Let me go!
Rachel.

1593
01:33:23,387 --> 01:33:24,721
Nick!

1594
01:33:44,808 --> 01:33:46,541
Hey, Cinderella.
What's wrong?

1595
01:33:46,543 --> 01:33:49,279
You gotta return your dress
before midnight?

1596
01:33:51,715 --> 01:33:54,216
Nicki-Nick!
Oh, you're just in time.

1597
01:34:06,430 --> 01:34:07,829
Oliver.

1598
01:34:07,831 --> 01:34:09,433
Oh, Nicki, have you...
Rachel. Have you seen Rachel?

1599
01:34:12,536 --> 01:34:13,970
Nicholas! Hi!

1600
01:34:13,972 --> 01:34:15,172
It's been so long.
Yes.

1601
01:34:18,809 --> 01:34:21,144
Amanda, no. Amanda, not now!

1602
01:35:04,388 --> 01:35:07,758
Rachel. Come to breakfast.

1603
01:35:09,126 --> 01:35:11,426
You need to eat.

1604
01:35:11,428 --> 01:35:17,167
Or use the bathroom,
or maybe a shower.

1605
01:35:19,836 --> 01:35:21,438
It's there if you need it.

1606
01:35:46,263 --> 01:35:49,764
Here, Rachel.
This is your dinner.

1607
01:35:49,766 --> 01:35:51,301
Thank you.

1608
01:36:11,388 --> 01:36:13,321
I'll stop by
again tonight.

1609
01:36:13,323 --> 01:36:17,160
Rachel, please,
just give me a call.

1610
01:36:18,328 --> 01:36:22,399
Anytime. Please.

1611
01:36:34,244 --> 01:36:37,312
Rachel,
someone's here to see ya.

1612
01:36:37,314 --> 01:36:39,414
I don't want
to see him.

1613
01:36:39,416 --> 01:36:40,617
It's not Nick.

1614
01:36:44,122 --> 01:36:45,857
Mom!

1615
01:36:58,301 --> 01:37:00,802
Drink more.

1616
01:37:00,804 --> 01:37:04,408
The dong-quai and the ginseng
will give you more energy.

1617
01:37:07,111 --> 01:37:08,777
Thanks.

1618
01:37:08,779 --> 01:37:12,948
Your spirit
has always been so strong,

1619
01:37:12,950 --> 01:37:14,116
ever since young.

1620
01:37:14,118 --> 01:37:17,187
You will get through this.

1621
01:37:19,857 --> 01:37:23,260
Why didn't you tell me
about my father?

1622
01:37:32,736 --> 01:37:37,541
My husband wasn't a good man.

1623
01:37:38,876 --> 01:37:40,444
He hurt me.

1624
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:48,383
But an old schoolmate of mine
helped me through things,

1625
01:37:48,385 --> 01:37:50,620
and we fell in love,

1626
01:37:51,755 --> 01:37:54,691
and I got pregnant
with his baby.

1627
01:37:55,392 --> 01:37:57,792
That's you.

1628
01:37:57,794 --> 01:38:00,462
I was so afraid
my husband would find out

1629
01:38:00,464 --> 01:38:01,763
and kill us both,

1630
01:38:01,765 --> 01:38:05,302
so I just took you
and I ran to America.

1631
01:38:07,370 --> 01:38:09,306
Did you ever...

1632
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:13,775
I don't know, think about
trying to talk to him?

1633
01:38:13,777 --> 01:38:15,779
I mean,
do you think about him?

1634
01:38:17,748 --> 01:38:18,813
Every day.

1635
01:38:18,815 --> 01:38:20,381
Oh.

1636
01:38:20,383 --> 01:38:22,517
When we first
came to America,

1637
01:38:22,519 --> 01:38:24,486
all I could think about
was reaching out for him,

1638
01:38:24,488 --> 01:38:28,124
but I was so afraid
my husband would find us.

1639
01:38:28,126 --> 01:38:32,327
And now, I just don't want
to cause any trouble.

1640
01:38:32,329 --> 01:38:33,530
Oh...

1641
01:38:37,101 --> 01:38:38,735
I'm really sorry.

1642
01:38:40,337 --> 01:38:42,905
Oh! Don't be sorry.

1643
01:38:45,776 --> 01:38:47,275
You listen to me.

1644
01:38:47,277 --> 01:38:50,311
Everything that happened
in my past life

1645
01:38:50,313 --> 01:38:52,915
is the reason why I got you.

1646
01:38:54,551 --> 01:38:57,320
My brave and clever girl.

1647
01:39:12,569 --> 01:39:14,872
I really thought
he was the one.

1648
01:39:17,141 --> 01:39:19,076
Now, I just want to go home.

1649
01:39:21,112 --> 01:39:25,181
You know, Nick was the one
who called me

1650
01:39:25,183 --> 01:39:27,816
and brought me out here.

1651
01:39:27,818 --> 01:39:32,857
Before we go, I think
you should go and talk to him.

1652
01:39:46,204 --> 01:39:48,170
I'll e-mail the photo later.

1653
01:39:48,172 --> 01:39:50,371
P.T., how long you been
standing there?

1654
01:39:50,373 --> 01:39:52,007
Just a short while.

1655
01:40:29,881 --> 01:40:33,683
I'm so sorry about everything.

1656
01:40:34,919 --> 01:40:37,052
What my mother did to you
is unforgivable.

1657
01:40:37,054 --> 01:40:39,156
It's not your fault.
It is.

1658
01:40:40,790 --> 01:40:42,024
Ever since I can remember,

1659
01:40:42,026 --> 01:40:43,893
my family has been
my whole life.

1660
01:40:43,895 --> 01:40:46,830
And I am done
making excuses for them.

1661
01:40:56,439 --> 01:40:57,839
Nick.

1662
01:40:57,841 --> 01:40:59,474
Marry me.

1663
01:40:59,476 --> 01:41:00,708
Marry me, and we'll start

1664
01:41:00,710 --> 01:41:02,111
a new life together
in New York.

1665
01:41:02,113 --> 01:41:04,916
Just you and me.
I'll leave all of this behind.

1666
01:42:18,856 --> 01:42:20,790
Thanks for meeting me here.

1667
01:42:22,659 --> 01:42:24,059
Don't worry about them.

1668
01:42:24,061 --> 01:42:26,596
They're half deaf
and they only speak Hokkien.

1669
01:42:54,524 --> 01:42:56,158
My mom taught me how to play.

1670
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:58,427
She told me Mahjong
would teach me

1671
01:42:58,429 --> 01:43:00,929
important life skills.

1672
01:43:00,931 --> 01:43:05,069
Negotiation,
strategy, cooperation.

1673
01:43:06,536 --> 01:43:11,042
You asked me here. I assume
it's not for a Mahjong lesson.

1674
01:43:14,011 --> 01:43:15,046
Pong.

1675
01:43:18,782 --> 01:43:20,918
My mother taught me, too.

1676
01:43:25,089 --> 01:43:28,991
I know Nick told you the truth
about my mom.

1677
01:43:28,993 --> 01:43:31,761
But you didn't like me
the second I got here.

1678
01:43:32,595 --> 01:43:33,896
Why is that?

1679
01:43:33,898 --> 01:43:36,231
There is a Hokkien phrase.

1680
01:43:37,201 --> 01:43:39,569
It means,
"Our own kind of people."

1681
01:43:41,038 --> 01:43:43,704
And you're not our own kind.

1682
01:43:43,706 --> 01:43:45,941
'Cause I'm not rich?

1683
01:43:45,943 --> 01:43:48,143
'Cause I didn't go to
a British boarding school,

1684
01:43:48,145 --> 01:43:50,778
or I wasn't born
into a wealthy family?

1685
01:43:50,780 --> 01:43:53,015
You're a foreigner. American.

1686
01:43:53,017 --> 01:43:57,585
And all Americans think about
is their own happiness.

1687
01:43:57,587 --> 01:43:59,587
Don't you want
Nick to be happy?

1688
01:43:59,589 --> 01:44:01,756
It's an illusion.

1689
01:44:01,758 --> 01:44:05,194
We understand
how to build things that last.

1690
01:44:05,196 --> 01:44:07,264
Something you know
nothing about.

1691
01:44:09,934 --> 01:44:11,766
You don't know me.

1692
01:44:11,768 --> 01:44:14,305
I know you're not
what Nick needs.

1693
01:44:19,009 --> 01:44:21,078
Well, he proposed
to me yesterday.

1694
01:44:26,350 --> 01:44:28,517
He said he'd walk away
from his family

1695
01:44:28,519 --> 01:44:30,653
and from you for good.

1696
01:44:34,592 --> 01:44:36,360
Don't worry.
I turned him down.

1697
01:44:40,830 --> 01:44:42,931
Only a fool
folds a winning hand.

1698
01:44:42,933 --> 01:44:48,103
There's no winning.
You made sure of that.

1699
01:44:48,105 --> 01:44:51,408
Because if Nick chose me,
he would lose his family.

1700
01:44:53,810 --> 01:44:56,111
And if he chose his family,

1701
01:44:56,113 --> 01:44:59,682
he might spend the rest
of his life resenting you.

1702
01:45:19,637 --> 01:45:22,703
So you chose for him.

1703
01:45:22,705 --> 01:45:25,140
I'm not leaving
'cause I'm scared

1704
01:45:25,142 --> 01:45:27,876
or because I think
I'm not enough.

1705
01:45:27,878 --> 01:45:32,316
Because maybe for the first
time in my life,

1706
01:45:33,317 --> 01:45:34,919
I know I am.

1707
01:45:36,453 --> 01:45:39,687
I just love Nick so much.

1708
01:45:39,689 --> 01:45:42,692
I don't want him
to lose his mom again.

1709
01:45:46,864 --> 01:45:52,034
So I just wanted you
to know that one day,

1710
01:45:52,036 --> 01:45:54,469
when he marries
another lucky girl

1711
01:45:54,471 --> 01:45:56,907
who is enough for you,

1712
01:45:58,808 --> 01:46:00,841
and you're playing
with your grandkids

1713
01:46:00,843 --> 01:46:02,743
while the tan huas
are blooming

1714
01:46:02,745 --> 01:46:05,216
and the birds are chirping,

1715
01:46:06,150 --> 01:46:09,750
that it was because of me.

1716
01:46:09,752 --> 01:46:13,956
A poor,
raised by a single mother,

1717
01:46:13,958 --> 01:46:19,829
low class, immigrant nobody.

1718
01:46:57,401 --> 01:46:59,001
Hey.

1719
01:46:59,003 --> 01:47:01,802
I'm gonna send someone
for the rest of my stuff.

1720
01:47:01,804 --> 01:47:03,171
But I wanna talk to you

1721
01:47:03,173 --> 01:47:04,373
about my visitation rights
with Cassian.

1722
01:47:04,375 --> 01:47:05,442
Stop talking.

1723
01:47:06,176 --> 01:47:07,309
What?

1724
01:47:07,311 --> 01:47:09,378
Don't worry
about packing your things.

1725
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:13,415
You bought this apartment,
you keep it. We're leaving.

1726
01:47:13,417 --> 01:47:14,815
What do you mean
you're leaving?

1727
01:47:14,817 --> 01:47:16,218
Where are you gonna go?

1728
01:47:16,220 --> 01:47:18,754
I have 14 apartment
buildings that I own,

1729
01:47:18,756 --> 01:47:22,190
so probably one of those.

1730
01:47:22,192 --> 01:47:23,759
And you'll see Cassian
when it's good for him,

1731
01:47:23,761 --> 01:47:25,229
not when it's good for you.

1732
01:47:27,531 --> 01:47:28,897
Hey!

1733
01:47:28,899 --> 01:47:30,732
Look, you know,
it's not just my fault

1734
01:47:30,734 --> 01:47:32,833
that things didn't work out.

1735
01:47:32,835 --> 01:47:37,072
You're right. I shouldn't have
kept things from you.

1736
01:47:37,074 --> 01:47:39,941
Hidden my shoes,
turned down jobs,

1737
01:47:39,943 --> 01:47:41,576
charity work,
worrying that it might

1738
01:47:41,578 --> 01:47:43,578
make you feel lesser than.

1739
01:47:43,580 --> 01:47:45,380
But let's be clear.

1740
01:47:45,382 --> 01:47:48,517
The problem with our marriage
isn't my family's money.

1741
01:47:48,519 --> 01:47:52,589
It's that you're a coward.
You gave up on us.

1742
01:47:53,991 --> 01:47:55,424
But I've just realized,

1743
01:47:55,426 --> 01:47:59,194
it's not my job
to make you feel like a man.

1744
01:47:59,196 --> 01:48:02,199
I can't make you
something you're not.

1745
01:48:08,405 --> 01:48:10,172
Good for you!

1746
01:48:10,174 --> 01:48:12,007
Walking away from Nick

1747
01:48:12,009 --> 01:48:16,311
and his family's fat-ass
property portfolio.

1748
01:48:16,313 --> 01:48:20,716
You have no one,
no net worth,

1749
01:48:20,718 --> 01:48:25,053
but you have integrity.
That's why I respect you.

1750
01:48:25,055 --> 01:48:27,091
Thank you for everything.

1751
01:49:02,359 --> 01:49:05,896
Bye, Mrs. Chu.
Goodbye and thank you.

1752
01:49:07,264 --> 01:49:09,364
Sure I can't get you to stay?

1753
01:49:09,366 --> 01:49:12,236
You know, my brother P.T.,
he's still single.

1754
01:49:25,516 --> 01:49:27,384
All right.

1755
01:50:05,189 --> 01:50:07,124
Rachel!

1756
01:50:08,158 --> 01:50:12,461
Rachel! Stay there.

1757
01:50:12,463 --> 01:50:16,200
I'm gonna go and look
for some extra blankets.

1758
01:50:18,068 --> 01:50:19,668
Hello.

1759
01:50:19,670 --> 01:50:23,205
Sorry, just one second.
Nick, what are you doing here?

1760
01:50:23,207 --> 01:50:25,273
I'm flying back
to New York with you.

1761
01:50:25,275 --> 01:50:27,910
God, don't make this harder
than it already is.

1762
01:50:27,912 --> 01:50:29,444
I always imagined what me

1763
01:50:29,446 --> 01:50:31,513
proposing to you
would be like.

1764
01:50:31,515 --> 01:50:34,549
You know what?
I had it all planned out.

1765
01:50:34,551 --> 01:50:35,650
Oh!

1766
01:50:35,652 --> 01:50:37,752
I'm right behind you.
Don't mind me.

1767
01:50:37,754 --> 01:50:40,522
I'd bring you to my favorite
spot on the island.

1768
01:50:40,524 --> 01:50:43,158
There's a hidden trail that
I used to go to as a child.

1769
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:44,493
Now there's a cove there

1770
01:50:44,495 --> 01:50:47,562
that opens up
to this beautiful lake.

1771
01:50:47,564 --> 01:50:49,164
Um... Sorry, dude.

1772
01:50:49,166 --> 01:50:51,034
Give me a second.

1773
01:50:53,303 --> 01:50:57,506
When the sun hits the horizon,
I'd get down on one knee.

1774
01:50:58,642 --> 01:51:01,176
And the rest of the world
would fall away.

1775
01:51:01,178 --> 01:51:02,777
Because it would
just be you...

1776
01:51:04,281 --> 01:51:05,915
Because it's just you...

1777
01:51:05,917 --> 01:51:07,415
Sorry,
I can help you with that.

1778
01:51:07,417 --> 01:51:09,284
All right, it's fine.
Stay there.

1779
01:51:09,286 --> 01:51:12,354
Yay. You, too?
Watch your fingers.

1780
01:51:12,356 --> 01:51:14,089
Lift it up. Okay.
Thank you.

1781
01:51:14,091 --> 01:51:16,291
Everybody okay?

1782
01:51:16,293 --> 01:51:18,961
Because I just need 30 seconds
with this woman.

1783
01:51:18,963 --> 01:51:20,863
Okay, thank you.

1784
01:51:20,865 --> 01:51:23,365
Oh. Coming through. Sorry.

1785
01:51:23,367 --> 01:51:26,869
I know this is a far throw
from a hidden paradise.

1786
01:51:28,272 --> 01:51:30,140
But wherever
you are in the world,

1787
01:51:31,275 --> 01:51:32,643
that's where I belong.

1788
01:51:34,545 --> 01:51:35,579
But I...

1789
01:51:40,952 --> 01:51:43,120
Rachel Chu,

1790
01:51:44,788 --> 01:51:46,054
will you marry me?

1791
01:51:48,725 --> 01:51:51,293
And make me the happiest man
in this world?

1792
01:51:51,295 --> 01:51:54,498
Yes! Yes! Yes!
She will marry you!

1793
01:51:55,098 --> 01:51:56,565
Yes!

1794
01:51:58,535 --> 01:51:59,401
Oh!

1795
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:13,983
I love you.
I love you, too.

1796
01:52:13,985 --> 01:52:17,586
This is gonna be
some flight back to New York.

1797
01:52:17,588 --> 01:52:20,791
Well, I was actually thinking
about staying one more night.

1798
01:52:33,972 --> 01:52:36,072
It's all about you, Nick!

1799
01:53:18,849 --> 01:53:21,718
Make babies! Make babies!
