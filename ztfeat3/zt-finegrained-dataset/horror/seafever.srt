00:00:04,706 --> 00:00:09,307
Dust welcomes you to
a special viewing experience.

3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:13,078
We thank you for joining us
to explore the depths

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,085
of the unknown in a dark,
isolated, and quiet place...

5
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:20,018
the ocean.

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,690
It goes largely unexplored,
and yet holds so much.

7
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:29,160
A different life exists
beneath its undulating surface.

8
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,496
You may have sensed its edges,

9
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:34,266
ventured only
to a shallow depth,

10
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:39,874
but science is our most curious
passenger, and it seeks more.

11
00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:43,341
This is "Sea Fever."

12
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:41,527
Oh, thank you!

13
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:43,361
Aw, nice to meet you!

14
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,131
Good to see you.

15
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:46,732
Did you get some cake?

16
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:48,102
Not joining in?

17
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:51,704
I don't do joining in.

18
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:54,339
Look, this parasite
isn't hadal.

19
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,508
It's in totally
the wrong place.

20
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,843
No, you are in totally
the wrong place!

21
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,411
What time are you supposed
to be on board?

22
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:02,581
3:00? But this is important,
Professor.

23
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,217
And your doctorate isn't?

24
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,353
You wouldn't fail me
for not going?

25
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,725
I would have no choice.

26
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,859
Off you go.

27
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:16,962
But I-I know my strengths,
I'm a good observer,

28
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:18,396
I'm good at seeing patterns.

29
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,900
You are an excellent scientist.
That's not in question.

30
00:03:20,902 --> 00:03:23,234
I need my own space,
I can't do other people.

31
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,236
This environment is much more
in the form of...

32
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:28,206
Siobhan! There's some
birthday cake over here.

33
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,614
Do you have any friends
in this department?

34
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,348
- But I...
- Get going!

35
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,219
Get your hands dirty,
make a few friends.

36
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,769
As I was starting
to think you weren't coming!

37
00:03:56,771 --> 00:03:58,204
Sorry.

38
00:03:58,206 --> 00:04:00,438
Skipper would have my guts
for garters.

39
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,941
That's a horrible thought!

40
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,581
There she is!
Niamh Cinn-Oir!

41
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:09,751
She's here!

42
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:11,351
.Okay...

43
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:23,396
Trick is, don't think,
just jump.

44
00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:27,235
Go on, give her a hand.

45
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,210
Siobhan,
this is my auntie Ciara.

46
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:40,447
You're the scientist, I hear.

47
00:04:43,084 --> 00:04:44,484
She's a charmer!

48
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,686
Have I ever let you down?

49
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,657
Apart from the times
I let you down, I mean.

50
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,491
We'll need a miracle.

51
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,495
Want to meet our student?

52
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,166
Ah, here she is at last.

53
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:02,134
I am Gerard the skipper,

54
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:04,570
this is Freya, the real boss.

55
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:07,474
She's a Viking.
Keeps us all afloat.

56
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,143
Siobhan, is it?

57
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:14,515
Gerard?
Don't forget to talk to Omid.

58
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:16,984
Johnny.

59
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,836
You're getting worried
about this.

60
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,538
It's our water,
it's important.

61
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,041
So when's the heir
to the throne arriving?

62
00:05:42,043 --> 00:05:44,610
- Three weeks.
- Oh, yeah?

63
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:46,712
Then I'm definitely gonna start
looking for something else.

64
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:49,648
So your job
is up for grabs, huh?

65
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,319
Take it easy now, I said
I'm gonna start looking.

66
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:55,623
Yeah, you're always
saying that.

67
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,389
Alright, lads?

68
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,358
- Good to go?
- Yeah.

69
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,393
Just, uh,
checked over his work,

70
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,198
made some corrections.

71
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,035
Now listen,

72
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:11,739
- we owe you money.
- Aw, great.

73
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:15,241
You'll get your last share
on top of this share.

74
00:06:15,243 --> 00:06:17,176
- What?
- Soon as we get back,

75
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:20,014
you have my word.
Sound okay?

76
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,881
Eh...

77
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:23,782
Skip, you know,
I have the baby coming.

78
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:27,519
I know, I know.
You'll get your shares.

79
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:28,923
Are we good to go?

80
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:33,592
- Yeah.
- Alright!

81
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:35,428
I'll make it up to ya!

82
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:40,735
We need a big
fucking haul this time.

83
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,372
So, what's your work?

84
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,773
Well, um...

85
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:50,509
I identify and extrapolate
patterns

86
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:53,212
from variations in deep sea
faunal behavior.

87
00:06:53,214 --> 00:06:56,248
Then I generate algorithms
and computer simulations

88
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,318
to predict
ecological outcomes.

89
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,056
I meant what is your work
while you're on board?

90
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:07,092
I need to photograph your
catch, look for anomalies.

91
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,994
Won't be hard.
We get all sorts.

92
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:12,066
And, um,
I need to do a short dive.

93
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,168
Like under water?

94
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:16,537
Do you dive?

95
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:21,008
- Fishermen don't swim.
- Why not?

96
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:26,347
'Cause it's better
to go fast.

97
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:29,283
Nobody wants to drown slow.

98
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:45,166
Uh. Sudi!
You haven't met Siobhan.

99
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:50,104
Fucking hell, man!

100
00:07:51,272 --> 00:07:53,572
Well she's pleased
to meet you too, mate.

101
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:55,343
Does the skipper
know about this?

102
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,913
He does now!

103
00:08:03,017 --> 00:08:06,585
- A redhead.
- We've already spent her fee.

104
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:10,291
I know, but we can't
afford any bad luck.

105
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:16,028
So you think the color
of my hair is bad luck?

106
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,464
Oh, well there's two
schools of thought on that.

107
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:21,533
I can't change what I am.

108
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:24,772
I know, I know, but um...
Maybe just...?

109
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:27,475
Not such a bad idea.

110
00:08:37,218 --> 00:08:38,319
Anchors away.

111
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:41,553
Alright then.

112
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:07,014
Pick a bunk!

113
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:14,053
- Why only four bunks?
- Oh, shift work.

114
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:15,988
Three people sleep
and three people work.

115
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,424
- How long's a shift?
- You get about 2 hours sleep.

116
00:09:18,426 --> 00:09:20,759
What? Sleep loss
effects cognition.

117
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:23,695
- Oh, talk to me!
- You get emotional outbursts.

118
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:25,532
I barely know
who I am by the end.

119
00:09:25,534 --> 00:09:26,901
Even psychosis?

120
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:30,438
Sea fever.
Happens.

121
00:09:32,273 --> 00:09:34,606
Eejit, come on.
You're not on shift.

122
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:37,709
Protect us, oh, Lord, from
all the perils of the deep.

123
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,878
My Christ who filled the nets
of his disciples

124
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,782
deliver us
safely back to harbor.

125
00:09:42,283 --> 00:09:43,617
Amen.

126
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,207
Make your last calls,

127
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:10,512
we'll be out of coverage
in a few minutes.

128
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:28,896
Fisheries are in.

129
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,702
Look at that.

130
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:38,672
Yes. Yes. Yes!

131
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,508
Our water filtration system.

132
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,143
You spend years at sea
and always have fresh water.

133
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:46,378
- It's magic.
- Magic?

134
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,481
- Where'd you go to school?
- Same place as she did!

135
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,016
Our doctoral student, Siobhan.

136
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:52,619
How many filters? z

137
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:55,923
Eh, three.
Ascending gauges.

138
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:59,326
- Ionizer?
- There.

139
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:05,497
- You designed this?
- Yes.

140
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,134
- Yeah, I did.
- It's brilliant.

141
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:11,672
Why don't you
have a better job?

142
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:16,108
Don't be fooled by her
winning personality,

143
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,511
- she can be quite blunt.
- No, I...

144
00:11:18,513 --> 00:11:20,513
I just mean for such
a talented engineer,

145
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:22,116
it's a low status job.

146
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:25,751
Yeah, well you know, I...

147
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:28,987
I have been waiting for
the right opportunity I guess.

148
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:30,222
Hey, don't touch that!

149
00:11:30,224 --> 00:11:31,957
- Ooh!
- Are you okay?

150
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,560
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah, sure?

151
00:11:33,562 --> 00:11:35,894
- She needs a place to work.
- Not in here, I'm sorry.

152
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,362
- Too dangerous.
- I'm not hurt.

153
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,033
I'm afraid I might be.

154
00:11:43,672 --> 00:11:45,672
I don't mind
you working there.

155
00:11:45,674 --> 00:11:47,540
It's not always quiet, but...

156
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:49,877
Oh, it's great, thank you.

157
00:11:56,317 --> 00:11:57,885
Are you cold?

158
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,759
Mother of Jesus, a redhead.

159
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:12,364
Take that thing off ya.

160
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:14,935
You're here now,
we better get used to ya.

161
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:22,274
Niamh Cinn-Oir
to Coast Guard. Over.

162
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:24,443
Freya, did you pick
up my e-mail?

163
00:12:24,445 --> 00:12:27,114
Coordinates are for
the exclusion zone. Over.

164
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,288
Fuck!

165
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,992
Bang on top of our fish!

166
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,195
Okay. We'll steam through
the exclusion zone. Over.

167
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:44,796
No, not allowed.

168
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:47,669
Whales and calves in the area.
Over.

169
00:12:49,638 --> 00:12:51,970
Roger that. Over and out.

170
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:54,406
Good luck out there.
Coast Guard out.

171
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:57,011
There goes our catch.

172
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:00,479
We'll get the hassars.

173
00:13:38,052 --> 00:13:40,588
Oh, you don't want it? Okay.

174
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,424
Um...

175
00:13:45,426 --> 00:13:47,527
Are ya hungry?

176
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:50,162
No! No, no, no, no. I'm fine.
I'll just, um...

177
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:51,365
I'll, uh...

178
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:00,031
Turn it off!

179
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:15,382
You out here every night?

180
00:15:22,624 --> 00:15:24,391
Oh, come look, come!

181
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:36,303
It's a bioluminescent
phytoplankton.

182
00:15:39,641 --> 00:15:42,240
It's one of the stories
of Niamh Cinn-Oir.

183
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:45,343
She was so sad about
losing her lover Oisin,

184
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:47,615
she gave herself to the sea.

185
00:15:49,551 --> 00:15:50,917
Drowned herself?

186
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,618
No.

187
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,188
No. She is immortal.

188
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:59,357
That's her hair,
lights up the sea.

189
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:34,361
Thanks.

190
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:53,946
Wow!

191
00:16:53,948 --> 00:16:56,183
Out here?

192
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,689
Whales on starboard,
lads.

193
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:05,058
What?

194
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,994
What?

195
00:17:07,996 --> 00:17:10,497
- Oh, yeah, look!
- Yeah, I can see!

196
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:13,733
There's two of them.

197
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:16,167
- Can you see it?
- Yeah, yeah, I see it!

198
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,437
And I think there's a calf.

199
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:19,972
Look there's another one,
just behind.

200
00:17:19,974 --> 00:17:21,541
Can you not see them?

201
00:17:21,543 --> 00:17:23,910
No, I can, it's, um...

202
00:17:23,912 --> 00:17:26,812
It's just that whales aren't
usually around fishing lanes.

203
00:17:26,814 --> 00:17:28,714
They don't like the noise.

204
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:45,565
Something's wrong.

205
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:47,600
Don't start that.
Whales are a good omen.

206
00:17:47,602 --> 00:17:49,267
Whales are a very good omen.

207
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,236
Another shoal dead ahead,

208
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:53,741
less than a mile.
It's a big one.

209
00:17:57,745 --> 00:17:59,146
Freya?

210
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:02,748
What?

211
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,218
That shoal's moving
pretty fast.

212
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:13,425
- You alright?
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

213
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,868
Jesus, what did we hit?!

214
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,573
Omid, what's the damage
down there?

215
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:30,076
Omid? Omid?

216
00:18:30,078 --> 00:18:33,413
Yeah, uh, can you send down
the student?

217
00:18:44,058 --> 00:18:45,925
Siobhan?

218
00:18:56,938 --> 00:18:59,270
Hey, something's changing
the texture of the wood.

219
00:19:14,989 --> 00:19:16,691
<i>We letting in?</i>

220
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:19,859
No, no, we're okay.

221
00:19:30,738 --> 00:19:33,641
Go get the small gauge
timber plugs. Now.

222
00:19:35,643 --> 00:19:37,344
Come on, fast, now!

223
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,814
Tell me you know what that is?

224
00:20:00,835 --> 00:20:02,835
It's like we're caught
on something!

225
00:20:10,545 --> 00:20:13,548
Niamh Cinn-Oir to Coast Guard,
come in.

226
00:20:14,982 --> 00:20:17,850
Niamh Cinn-Oir to Coast Guard,
come in?

227
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:30,898
You took us into
the exclusion zone.

228
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,525
What is that?

229
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:00,895
Chemical spill, maybe?

230
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,608
- What's happening?
- I don't know!

231
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,576
- Are we sinking?
- I don't know!

232
00:21:17,578 --> 00:21:19,310
- What?
- Siobhan, Jesus Christ!

233
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:22,480
- Are we sinking?
- We are not sinking.

234
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,482
You're a fucking eejit,
do you know that?

235
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:27,622
Christ knows what we're tangled up in.
It could be anything!

236
00:21:44,872 --> 00:21:47,008
Good Jesus...

237
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:50,475
Is this what's
stopping us moving?

238
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,711
Yeah, something's getting
through the hole.

239
00:22:00,855 --> 00:22:02,422
Christ!

240
00:22:22,877 --> 00:22:24,645
What is that?

241
00:22:27,148 --> 00:22:29,650
Could be a species
of barnacle.

242
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,154
Do you have your scuba gear
on board?

243
00:22:35,156 --> 00:22:36,522
I do.

244
00:22:36,524 --> 00:22:38,391
And you have to do
a dive anyway.

245
00:22:39,293 --> 00:22:41,026
- Yes.
- So you could do your dive

246
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:42,928
and take off
the barnacles for us.

247
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,462
But that could be anything!

248
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:47,635
It's what you're here for,
anomalies, no?

249
00:22:51,572 --> 00:22:54,907
Here, listen.
I've got you, yeah?

250
00:23:01,582 --> 00:23:03,749
It's a gutting knife.

251
00:23:03,751 --> 00:23:06,218
Just do your best.

252
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:17,549
I'm never going back down
there again!

253
00:25:17,551 --> 00:25:19,051
- What?
- What happened?

254
00:25:19,053 --> 00:25:20,821
Describe
what they looked like.

255
00:25:25,726 --> 00:25:29,161
- What?
- It's...

256
00:25:29,163 --> 00:25:30,729
It's... It's one animal.

257
00:25:30,731 --> 00:25:32,664
It's one huge animal.

258
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:34,233
Wait, what,
as well as the barnacles?

259
00:25:34,235 --> 00:25:37,104
No, i-i-it's not barnacles,
it's, um...

260
00:25:38,072 --> 00:25:39,805
It's connective tissue.

261
00:25:39,807 --> 00:25:42,107
- Connected to what?
- Like tendrils,

262
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:43,842
like, like a lot of tendrils.

263
00:25:43,844 --> 00:25:45,911
Water's cloudy, she doesn't
know what she saw.

264
00:25:45,913 --> 00:25:48,447
Freya...
A squid!

265
00:25:48,449 --> 00:25:50,416
Bet you
it's some kind of squid.

266
00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:53,354
It's more like some kind
of cnidarian, but, um...

267
00:25:54,021 --> 00:25:55,654
It could be a squid.

268
00:25:55,656 --> 00:25:57,122
But if it's a squid,
it's bigger,

269
00:25:57,124 --> 00:25:58,891
it's bigger than anything
on record...

270
00:25:58,893 --> 00:26:01,093
- It's... It's huge!
- Giant squid!

271
00:26:01,095 --> 00:26:03,062
- You want the winch?
- Oh, yeah!

272
00:26:03,064 --> 00:26:05,864
- All hands on deck, come on!
- No...!

273
00:26:10,838 --> 00:26:11,904
Please!

274
00:26:11,906 --> 00:26:14,706
- We need to call for help.
- We'll be fine.

275
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:17,943
Squid can't hold their own
bodyweight in shallow water.

276
00:26:17,945 --> 00:26:19,912
We lift it even a bit,
it'll have to loosen

277
00:26:19,914 --> 00:26:22,247
its grip on the boat.
That's how we get free.

278
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:24,118
Johnny, winch her up.

279
00:26:42,336 --> 00:26:43,637
Keep it going.

280
00:27:01,956 --> 00:27:02,957
Gerard.

281
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:06,894
Let go of the winch.

282
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:24,513
Oh, fuck... Oh, fuck!

283
00:27:25,514 --> 00:27:27,179
Right, someone hit the brake!

284
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:29,283
- Get the fucking brake!
- Ow!

285
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,653
Fuck! Ow!

286
00:27:41,962 --> 00:27:43,328
Sorry, sorry...

287
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,998
Sorry. Take it easy.
Easy, easy now!

288
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:21,769
- There's another boat!
- What?

289
00:28:22,403 --> 00:28:23,837
That way!

290
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:31,310
Bastards.

291
00:28:31,312 --> 00:28:33,414
You're unbelievable.

292
00:28:37,051 --> 00:28:39,019
We'd have
to split the profits.

293
00:28:41,755 --> 00:28:43,692
They might have
a better winch.

294
00:28:45,092 --> 00:28:46,460
And a radio.

295
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,743
Gerard can't row over there
on his own.

296
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:07,647
I'm not getting in beside that thing.
No way.

297
00:29:07,649 --> 00:29:10,382
It's a bad idea. Let's just
wait for the Coast Guard.

298
00:29:10,384 --> 00:29:13,352
Come on!
Big commercial boat over there,

299
00:29:13,354 --> 00:29:15,189
they'll be able to help us.

300
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:19,760
I'll go.

301
00:29:23,964 --> 00:29:25,899
- I'll go as well.
- No.

302
00:29:27,968 --> 00:29:30,471
Ger... Three of us.

303
00:30:10,311 --> 00:30:11,478
Hello?

304
00:30:13,013 --> 00:30:14,882
Anyone aboard?

305
00:30:30,197 --> 00:30:31,498
Fine mesh trawling.

306
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:35,503
Desperation makes you
do things.

307
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:38,705
Hello?

308
00:30:40,608 --> 00:30:41,907
Hello?

309
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:49,314
They smashed the radio.

310
00:30:49,316 --> 00:30:51,350
Why would they do that?

311
00:30:51,352 --> 00:30:52,884
I don't understand.

312
00:30:52,886 --> 00:30:54,556
Shh, listen.

313
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:58,457
I can't hear anything.

314
00:30:58,459 --> 00:31:00,160
That's what I mean.

315
00:31:05,032 --> 00:31:07,468
We should just go.

316
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,070
Hello?

317
00:31:14,241 --> 00:31:15,844
Johnny, go on.

318
00:31:29,022 --> 00:31:30,692
Come on, Siobhan.

319
00:32:21,074 --> 00:32:22,909
Hello?

320
00:32:26,447 --> 00:32:28,415
Hello?

321
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,299
Jesus Christ...!

322
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:49,134
Fucking hell.

323
00:32:56,845 --> 00:32:57,976
Must have gone mad.

324
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:13,160
Oh my God...!

325
00:33:16,497 --> 00:33:19,197
Oh...! Fuck...

326
00:33:21,503 --> 00:33:23,603
- Sea fever.
- What?

327
00:33:23,605 --> 00:33:27,138
No sleep. One fella loses it.
Spreads like wildfire.

328
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,474
That might explain the
suicide, but the eyes?

329
00:33:29,476 --> 00:33:31,311
Might've been the birds.

330
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:44,256
Listen, say nothing
about this.

331
00:33:44,258 --> 00:33:46,393
- Nothing at all?
- Nothing at all!

332
00:33:49,898 --> 00:33:52,063
How will we get home now?

333
00:34:13,086 --> 00:34:14,185
Omid?

334
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,910
Hey, how'd it go?
They have a winch?

335
00:34:37,912 --> 00:34:39,912
Ah, they've
their own problems.

336
00:34:39,914 --> 00:34:42,314
No help at all.

337
00:34:42,316 --> 00:34:44,384
We wanna show you guys
something.

338
00:34:48,923 --> 00:34:51,489
That thing let us go,
we're free!

339
00:34:51,491 --> 00:34:54,326
Didn't I tell you
we'd be fine? Ha!

340
00:35:21,556 --> 00:35:24,090
Animals don't trap
something and just let it go.

341
00:35:24,092 --> 00:35:26,525
Maybe it got injured when
we tried winching it up?

342
00:35:26,527 --> 00:35:28,794
Could have secreted something
defensive, I suppose.

343
00:35:28,796 --> 00:35:31,296
- Sounds plausible.
- Or venom.

344
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:33,099
And we're immune.

345
00:35:33,101 --> 00:35:34,934
Or a digestive substance.

346
00:35:34,936 --> 00:35:37,603
And the boat's inedible.

347
00:35:37,605 --> 00:35:39,774
<i>Large mass heading
this way, lads.</i>

348
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:43,711
Or it's coming back for us.

349
00:35:52,185 --> 00:35:54,654
Freya, we've no catch.

350
00:35:54,656 --> 00:35:56,154
And if that thing
grabs onto us?

351
00:35:56,156 --> 00:35:57,657
We'll net it before
it gets near us.

352
00:35:57,659 --> 00:35:58,826
We know now.

353
00:36:00,394 --> 00:36:01,493
God, it's a risk.

354
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:03,665
Have I ever let you down?
Huh?

355
00:36:05,465 --> 00:36:08,366
Listen, if you want, we can...
we can steam home right now.

356
00:36:08,368 --> 00:36:11,706
But if we do that,
we'll lose the boat.

357
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,709
We'll lose the boat.

358
00:36:23,316 --> 00:36:24,984
- Shoot the net.
- Yeah!

359
00:37:01,923 --> 00:37:05,390
Yes!

360
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:06,894
We're on a roll!

361
00:37:07,862 --> 00:37:09,461
Woo!

362
00:37:09,463 --> 00:37:11,063
So, what'll you do with
your shares?

363
00:37:11,065 --> 00:37:14,399
- Parts for the new bike.
- Ah, Omid's old rust bucket?

364
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:15,935
Hey, come on,
it's a good bike.

365
00:37:15,937 --> 00:37:19,173
Hey! It's not a bike.
It's a love machine.

366
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,174
What's her name? Alice...?

367
00:37:22,176 --> 00:37:24,744
- Alison O'Reilly.
- O'Reilly!

368
00:37:24,746 --> 00:37:26,645
Alison O'Reilly.

369
00:37:26,647 --> 00:37:29,282
We're hitting the highway.
Just need a new sump.

370
00:37:30,118 --> 00:37:31,951
Sump. Every girl's dream.

371
00:37:31,953 --> 00:37:34,120
Oh God... Fuck.

372
00:37:40,393 --> 00:37:41,394
You okay?

373
00:37:44,464 --> 00:37:46,968
No, actually,
I'm bloody knackered.

374
00:38:14,028 --> 00:38:15,630
Is it always like this?

375
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:18,599
No. Sometimes it's scary.

376
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:23,702
Things happen at sea.

377
00:38:23,704 --> 00:38:25,303
Yeah, but things
like that other boat?

378
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:27,273
Coast Guard'll deal with it.
And listen, I've seen worse.

379
00:38:27,275 --> 00:38:29,143
You've seen worse?!

380
00:38:30,578 --> 00:38:31,579
Look.

381
00:38:33,247 --> 00:38:35,016
Can I give you some advice?

382
00:38:35,683 --> 00:38:36,949
Listen, we're here.

383
00:38:36,951 --> 00:38:40,119
We're safe so just...
Let it go.

384
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:41,488
For a minute.

385
00:38:42,355 --> 00:38:43,524
Rest.

386
00:38:50,965 --> 00:38:52,733
What would I do instead?

387
00:38:56,637 --> 00:38:58,438
Are you making a pass at me?

388
00:38:59,674 --> 00:39:00,739
No.

389
00:39:00,741 --> 00:39:02,074
'Cause I've had people make
passes at me before!

390
00:39:02,076 --> 00:39:04,677
- Yeah, I'm sure you have...
- No, I mean...

391
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:06,346
What I mean is...

392
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,051
It would be okay if you were.

393
00:39:16,991 --> 00:39:18,757
Best catch we've
had in months.

394
00:39:18,759 --> 00:39:20,092
Bad luck's streak's
finally over.

395
00:39:20,094 --> 00:39:22,294
Yeah, it was about
fuckin' time!

396
00:39:22,296 --> 00:39:24,864
- Hey, hey, guys.
- Oh, bollocks!

397
00:39:24,866 --> 00:39:26,932
- Watch your head, man!
- Hey, is there no free towel?

398
00:39:26,934 --> 00:39:29,568
You already took a shower.
Look at you, man!

399
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,303
Slime on me,
that shit is everywhere.

400
00:39:31,305 --> 00:39:34,039
Johnny, your auntie said
you're on kitchen duty tonight.

401
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:35,776
Yep. Sounds about right.

402
00:39:36,577 --> 00:39:38,344
Hey, you guys okay?

403
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:46,520
Hey, come on, sit down.

404
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:56,562
- Omid.
- Yeah?

405
00:39:56,564 --> 00:39:58,931
Are you ready for the
responsibilities of fatherhood?

406
00:39:58,933 --> 00:40:00,431
You look hot.

407
00:40:00,433 --> 00:40:02,968
Thank you. I was going to
say the same about you

408
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,402
but you got there first, so.

409
00:40:04,404 --> 00:40:05,971
I mean you might
have a fever.

410
00:40:05,973 --> 00:40:07,940
Nah, I just had a shower.

411
00:40:07,942 --> 00:40:09,608
Yeah, for fucking
half an hour!

412
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:12,211
You smell that guys?
You smell something?

413
00:40:12,213 --> 00:40:13,913
Oh, it's the shit from...

414
00:40:13,915 --> 00:40:17,415
Excuse me, excuse me!
Have you looked in the mirror lately?

415
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:19,551
There's this black thing
on your face!

416
00:40:19,553 --> 00:40:21,555
Everyone, everyone.
Redhead or not,

417
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,522
best student we've ever had,

418
00:40:23,524 --> 00:40:25,423
- am I right?
- Hear hear!

419
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:27,860
- Nerves of steel!
- Yeah, she is.

420
00:40:27,862 --> 00:40:29,630
Yeah, as long as she's not
trying to find the winch brake!

421
00:40:30,998 --> 00:40:32,430
Sure, you were worse.

422
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:34,533
We had to teach you
how to eat spaghetti.

423
00:40:34,535 --> 00:40:38,304
No, spaghetti is stupid and you know
it, okay? You know...!

424
00:40:38,306 --> 00:40:39,805
Hey, who was it that nearly

425
00:40:39,807 --> 00:40:41,439
- destroyed the engine, huh?
- No, I'm going...!

426
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:43,409
Let his rope fall
around the propeller.

427
00:40:43,411 --> 00:40:45,911
Rope around the prop.
It was bad.

428
00:40:45,913 --> 00:40:48,013
- It jammed. Killed the engine.
- Hey, at least I make a good

429
00:40:48,015 --> 00:40:49,248
ship's engineer one day,
right?

430
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:52,820
Anyway, here's to the best
student we've ever had.

431
00:40:53,354 --> 00:40:54,920
Cheers to that.

432
00:41:00,094 --> 00:41:01,662
You okay?

433
00:41:07,335 --> 00:41:09,270
Come on, let's go for a swim.

434
00:41:13,107 --> 00:41:15,574
Wait, what did he say?

435
00:41:15,576 --> 00:41:17,511
He said he wants to go
for a swim.

436
00:41:20,348 --> 00:41:23,182
- Well fucking stop him!
- Jesus Christ.

437
00:41:23,184 --> 00:41:24,352
Where's he going?

438
00:41:29,991 --> 00:41:31,790
- Johnny, stop.
- I'm fine! I'm fine!

439
00:41:31,792 --> 00:41:33,525
Leave me alone. I'm fine.
We're going in,

440
00:41:33,527 --> 00:41:35,227
we're going...
We're going for a dip.

441
00:41:35,229 --> 00:41:37,863
Look, 30 seconds, it's just
a dip basically isn't it?

442
00:41:37,865 --> 00:41:40,032
- Don't!
- Come on.

443
00:41:40,034 --> 00:41:42,134
- We're going swimming.
- You're not going in.

444
00:41:42,136 --> 00:41:44,136
- No, no, no!
- You're not going in.

445
00:41:44,138 --> 00:41:46,005
I'm grand!

446
00:41:46,007 --> 00:41:48,707
Take it easy now, come on.

447
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:51,477
Lunatic. There's a
motherfucking monster out there!

448
00:41:51,479 --> 00:41:54,982
What kind of eejit goes diving
off a trawler to impress a girl?

449
00:41:58,652 --> 00:42:01,854
- What the fuck, Johnny?
- What are you on?

450
00:42:01,856 --> 00:42:02,990
Nothing.

451
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:06,225
If you brought drugs
onto this boat...!

452
00:42:06,227 --> 00:42:07,693
I didn't and I wouldn't.

453
00:42:07,695 --> 00:42:09,962
- Did you give him something?
- No, he's hot.

454
00:42:09,964 --> 00:42:11,632
I think his hand might be
infected.

455
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:15,667
- Let me see your hand.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

456
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:18,239
I need to sleep is all.

457
00:42:23,744 --> 00:42:25,577
Johnny, would you like me
to look at your eye?

458
00:42:44,865 --> 00:42:45,866
What?

459
00:42:47,101 --> 00:42:48,436
- I think I saw something.
- Let me see.

460
00:42:50,004 --> 00:42:51,737
Come here now.

461
00:43:00,681 --> 00:43:01,914
Can't see anything.

462
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:03,882
Bloody hell, you nearly
had me going there.

463
00:43:03,884 --> 00:43:06,620
Jumping at shadows.
Relax the head. You...!

464
00:43:07,655 --> 00:43:09,390
Get some sleep.

465
00:43:17,031 --> 00:43:19,934
Right, well, I'm just
gonna... over here...

466
00:43:54,168 --> 00:43:55,801
Fuck!

467
00:43:55,803 --> 00:43:56,804
Jesus, Johnny!

468
00:43:58,272 --> 00:44:00,139
Take it easy!

469
00:44:00,141 --> 00:44:02,309
- Let me see, let me see!
- What is it?

470
00:44:03,944 --> 00:44:06,345
You're okay, take it easy!

471
00:44:06,347 --> 00:44:10,251
I-I... I can't...
I can't see.

472
00:44:24,298 --> 00:44:25,466
Johnny!

473
00:44:28,135 --> 00:44:30,537
No! Noooo!
Oh, God!

474
00:44:30,539 --> 00:44:33,640
- Shhh!
- Help! Let me up, please.

475
00:44:33,642 --> 00:44:35,007
What is it?

476
00:44:37,878 --> 00:44:40,312
Johnny, Johnny, shh!

477
00:44:40,314 --> 00:44:41,650
You're okay.

478
00:44:45,386 --> 00:44:49,755
Oh, my God!

479
00:44:49,757 --> 00:44:51,825
Oh, Johnny!

480
00:44:53,194 --> 00:44:54,493
Oh, Jesus!

481
00:45:07,441 --> 00:45:09,441
Move back.
Don't touch anything!

482
00:45:09,443 --> 00:45:11,210
Move back! Move back!

483
00:45:11,212 --> 00:45:14,413
Come with me, right now.
Come with me.

484
00:45:17,985 --> 00:45:18,986
I love you.

485
00:45:21,088 --> 00:45:23,922
Listen, um, they were
parasites in his eyes.

486
00:45:23,924 --> 00:45:26,160
- What? How?
- They went into the water.

487
00:45:27,194 --> 00:45:28,462
I'll go turn it off.

488
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:30,764
Where's Sudi?

489
00:45:38,472 --> 00:45:40,939
Sudi! Turn off the shower!

490
00:45:40,941 --> 00:45:43,175
- Fuck off!
- We're not fucking joking!

491
00:45:43,177 --> 00:45:44,478
Turn off the shower now!

492
00:45:45,412 --> 00:45:47,815
Sudi! Sudi?!

493
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:51,551
Sudi, please! Listen to
me! Open up the door!

494
00:45:51,553 --> 00:45:53,919
Oi! Bastards!

495
00:45:53,921 --> 00:45:55,655
Now Sudi!
Turn off the shower!

496
00:45:55,657 --> 00:45:57,823
Turn off the water!
Hey, listen to me.

497
00:45:57,825 --> 00:45:58,957
Open the door.

498
00:45:58,959 --> 00:46:01,262
Open the door right now!

499
00:46:03,197 --> 00:46:05,833
Sudi! Sudi, please,
listen to me!

500
00:46:12,674 --> 00:46:14,842
Alright. You're alright.
You're alright.

501
00:46:15,577 --> 00:46:16,810
It's okay.

502
00:46:18,012 --> 00:46:19,411
Come here.

503
00:46:27,589 --> 00:46:28,987
Okay...

504
00:46:28,989 --> 00:46:31,258
Shhh... Johnny...

505
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:34,928
I have ya.
You're okay.

506
00:46:37,031 --> 00:46:38,930
You're okay.

507
00:48:31,546 --> 00:48:33,412
Straight through the steel.

508
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,801
Jesus Christ!

509
00:49:05,613 --> 00:49:07,247
Oh! Agh!

510
00:49:08,248 --> 00:49:09,448
Fuck!

511
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:10,819
It's okay, it's the filter.

512
00:49:13,721 --> 00:49:14,955
Where does this flow to?

513
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:25,464
Nothing can get in or out now.

514
00:49:25,466 --> 00:49:26,935
Except through the lid.

515
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:30,137
We need to open it.

516
00:49:31,038 --> 00:49:32,370
Are you crazy?

517
00:49:32,372 --> 00:49:34,843
If I can identify them
it'll be helpful.

518
00:49:38,513 --> 00:49:40,214
Put these on.

519
00:49:46,654 --> 00:49:48,989
Hey, please, careful.

520
00:50:12,647 --> 00:50:14,147
What are they?

521
00:50:14,949 --> 00:50:17,048
I don't know.
But I think...

522
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,786
Maybe they're larvae.

523
00:50:21,054 --> 00:50:23,691
We need to get those things
out of the tank.

524
00:50:24,792 --> 00:50:26,726
So empty it!

525
00:50:26,728 --> 00:50:28,493
What are you waiting for?
Fuck's sake!

526
00:50:28,495 --> 00:50:30,262
- How? We've no pump.
- Exactly.

527
00:50:30,264 --> 00:50:32,197
- And we need fresh water.
- We'll boil it.

528
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:34,032
And what do we do
for drinking water?

529
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:35,668
Fish them out of the tank!

530
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:38,236
They bit through the steel
water filters.

531
00:50:38,238 --> 00:50:40,673
They'll probably be dead
in the next few hours.

532
00:50:40,675 --> 00:50:42,209
Alright, alright.
We're all grieving.

533
00:50:43,545 --> 00:50:45,011
What did you say?

534
00:50:45,013 --> 00:50:46,512
If I'm right...

535
00:50:46,514 --> 00:50:49,849
they're saltwater larvae
in fresh water.

536
00:50:49,851 --> 00:50:51,819
They'll be dead
in the next few hours.

537
00:50:53,922 --> 00:50:56,421
Right. She's... She's right.

538
00:50:56,423 --> 00:50:57,924
Did Johnny get
bitten like this?

539
00:50:57,926 --> 00:51:00,191
No! No, he didn't.

540
00:51:00,193 --> 00:51:01,994
Let's just focus, huh?

541
00:51:01,996 --> 00:51:05,432
What did they say,
on the other trawler, huh?

542
00:51:09,469 --> 00:51:12,472
Nothing.
They're all dead.

543
00:51:18,412 --> 00:51:20,913
It was sea fever.
They took their own lives.

544
00:51:20,915 --> 00:51:22,884
Alright?
Now...

545
00:51:24,251 --> 00:51:25,918
We need to keep our
heads clear, yeah?

546
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,920
Omid,

547
00:51:27,922 --> 00:51:30,123
get Sudi to bed.
And um...

548
00:51:34,562 --> 00:51:36,328
You and Siobhan
will check the water

549
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:37,930
- in two hours time.
- Okay, good.

550
00:51:37,932 --> 00:51:42,434
We'll say a prayer
for Johnny at dawn.

551
00:51:42,436 --> 00:51:45,138
Let's all get some rest now.
You take first watch.

552
00:51:47,441 --> 00:51:50,745
- What?
- She's fine, Ciara.

553
00:52:03,725 --> 00:52:06,493
Okay?
Yeah? There you go.

554
00:52:08,428 --> 00:52:10,632
She doesn't even
know my name, man.

555
00:52:11,465 --> 00:52:12,834
Alison O'Reilly.

556
00:52:14,102 --> 00:52:15,670
I haven't even spoken to her.

557
00:52:16,904 --> 00:52:18,271
What are you talking about?

558
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,342
I was just waiting
for the right time.

559
00:52:24,545 --> 00:52:26,179
The right time?

560
00:52:29,984 --> 00:52:31,619
And then you...

561
00:52:41,796 --> 00:52:43,562
You're alright.

562
00:52:43,564 --> 00:52:45,833
I just can't believe...

563
00:53:15,395 --> 00:53:17,031
It's time.

564
00:53:52,066 --> 00:53:54,867
- Are they dead?
- I think we're good.

565
00:53:54,869 --> 00:53:56,037
Yeah?

566
00:54:15,123 --> 00:54:17,656
Not long til they eat
through the tank.

567
00:54:17,658 --> 00:54:19,992
They're weaker. I think
there's fewer of them.

568
00:54:19,994 --> 00:54:21,527
We'll just have to wait.

569
00:54:25,933 --> 00:54:29,769
He who puts himself
in my hands,

570
00:54:29,771 --> 00:54:31,436
though he were dead,

571
00:54:31,438 --> 00:54:34,439
yet shall he live,

572
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:37,810
and whosoever trusts in me,

573
00:54:37,812 --> 00:54:40,280
shall never die.

574
00:54:46,954 --> 00:54:49,221
Se do bheatha, a Mhuire,
ata lan de ghrasta,

575
00:54:49,223 --> 00:54:51,322
Ta an Tiarna leat.
Is beannaithe thu idir mna,

576
00:54:51,324 --> 00:54:53,391
Agus is beannaithe toradh
do bhroinne; Iosa.

577
00:54:53,393 --> 00:54:55,696
Have you something
to help you sleep?

578
00:55:00,601 --> 00:55:02,635
Listen, burn the engine
if you have to.

579
00:55:02,637 --> 00:55:04,337
Just get us home fast.

580
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:43,511
What are you doing?

581
00:55:51,552 --> 00:55:53,319
You're still bleeding.

582
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:00,526
Everything is fuzzy.

583
00:56:06,767 --> 00:56:08,366
Is this what happened
to Johnny?

584
00:56:08,368 --> 00:56:10,336
No, he had a fever.

585
00:56:10,338 --> 00:56:12,872
You've just lost a lot of blood,
so it's affecting your eyes.

586
00:56:12,874 --> 00:56:14,573
You mean I'm going blind?

587
00:56:14,575 --> 00:56:17,309
- Yes, might be temporary.
- Might be?!

588
00:56:17,311 --> 00:56:19,912
Listen, I'm sorry,

589
00:56:19,914 --> 00:56:22,250
I can't help you right now.
I need to focus.

590
00:56:24,185 --> 00:56:25,517
Fucking redhead.

591
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:28,220
None of this would have
happened without you!

592
00:56:28,222 --> 00:56:31,389
You're confusing
coincidence and cause.

593
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:34,093
My hair and this happening
is coincidence, but...

594
00:56:39,734 --> 00:56:41,767
It was the slime!

595
00:56:41,769 --> 00:56:43,802
The thing that attached
itself to the boat.

596
00:56:43,804 --> 00:56:46,205
It mistook our boat
for an animal.

597
00:56:46,207 --> 00:56:47,339
Probably a whale.

598
00:56:47,341 --> 00:56:49,208
And when it latched onto us,

599
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:51,510
i-it produced a progenerative
substance.

600
00:56:51,512 --> 00:56:53,379
And Johnny had an open wound.

601
00:56:53,381 --> 00:56:57,116
So, uh, the slime got into
Johnny's blood

602
00:56:57,118 --> 00:56:58,717
and there were eggs
in the slime?

603
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:01,088
Not were... are.

604
00:57:01,756 --> 00:57:03,923
They're still alive.

605
00:57:03,925 --> 00:57:06,527
Sudi's got open wounds,
we've all got cuts.

606
00:57:07,862 --> 00:57:11,429
We're all vulnerable to get
infected just like Johnny.

607
00:57:11,431 --> 00:57:13,234
If we're not already.

608
00:57:16,003 --> 00:57:17,435
Any good news?

609
00:57:17,437 --> 00:57:19,538
We need to kill those eggs
right now.

610
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:21,709
- Fucking how?!
- I don't know!

611
00:57:22,543 --> 00:57:25,010
I study behavior patterns
in a lab.

612
00:57:25,012 --> 00:57:26,479
You kill things.

613
00:57:30,351 --> 00:57:31,550
Give it here.

614
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,328
Here.

615
00:57:41,896 --> 00:57:43,164
This won't work.

616
00:57:44,464 --> 00:57:46,100
So what do we do?

617
00:57:50,204 --> 00:57:52,638
Can you make a UV light?

618
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,106
Why?

619
00:57:54,108 --> 00:57:57,309
Other hadopelagic species,
their spawn,

620
00:57:57,311 --> 00:57:59,479
you can kill it with intense
UV light.

621
00:58:02,316 --> 00:58:03,949
You have a smart phone?

622
00:58:03,951 --> 00:58:07,753
I learnt this in a bar
at Tishreen University.

623
00:58:07,755 --> 00:58:08,756
Where's that?

624
00:58:09,857 --> 00:58:11,392
Syria.

625
00:58:14,061 --> 00:58:15,629
You met your wife there?

626
00:58:17,198 --> 00:58:19,598
- How'd you guess?
- I don't guess.

627
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,534
I study behavior patterns.

628
00:58:22,536 --> 00:58:24,505
You were touching
your wedding ring.

629
00:58:29,977 --> 00:58:33,846
- It's tiny.
- Just do the test.

630
00:58:33,848 --> 00:58:36,350
We can figure out how to
make it bigger later.

631
00:59:02,109 --> 00:59:04,445
It's too tiny anyway.

632
00:59:09,216 --> 00:59:11,884
How long til we're home?

633
00:59:11,886 --> 00:59:14,021
I'd say about 30 hours.

634
00:59:14,989 --> 00:59:17,291
We'll all be infected
by then.

635
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,441
Omid.

636
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:41,215
I have another stupid idea.

637
00:59:41,916 --> 00:59:43,215
Are you mad?

638
00:59:43,217 --> 00:59:44,716
Disinfectant doesn't
kill the eggs,

639
00:59:44,718 --> 00:59:45,953
UV light doesn't either.

640
00:59:47,588 --> 00:59:50,289
So you want
to electrocute the Niamh?

641
00:59:50,291 --> 00:59:52,958
Yes.
We use the ARC welder.

642
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,763
Sea water as a conductor and
run a current around the boat.

643
00:59:57,865 --> 00:59:59,932
Come on, as long as we're
all wearing rubber boots

644
00:59:59,934 --> 01:00:01,300
there's no risk to us.

645
01:00:01,302 --> 01:00:02,868
And you'll take
responsibility?

646
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:04,238
Hold on!

647
01:00:05,439 --> 01:00:07,806
What about the motors?
The engine?

648
01:00:07,808 --> 01:00:10,676
I'll try and insulate them.

649
01:00:10,678 --> 01:00:13,445
Oh, you'll try!

650
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:15,683
And what about
the risk of fire?

651
01:00:20,589 --> 01:00:22,955
Are you insane?

652
01:00:22,957 --> 01:00:24,857
No!

653
01:00:24,859 --> 01:00:27,159
Fucking no!

654
01:00:27,161 --> 01:00:28,694
You can't risk my boat!

655
01:00:28,696 --> 01:00:30,062
It's a risk either way.

656
01:00:30,064 --> 01:00:32,800
You risk the boat or
you risk our bodies.

657
01:01:11,872 --> 01:01:14,543
Fuck's sake!
This is insane!

658
01:01:15,476 --> 01:01:17,512
Pretty sure Omid'll
sort it out.

659
01:01:19,313 --> 01:01:21,516
Okay. Do it.

660
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,055
Omid?

661
01:02:29,551 --> 01:02:31,183
Are we on fire?

662
01:02:31,185 --> 01:02:34,786
No, it's just... just surface
electrics.

663
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:41,121
Did it work?

664
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:45,625
- I think so.
- Thank you.

665
01:03:45,627 --> 01:03:47,629
We can go ashore once
we know we're clear.

666
01:03:51,432 --> 01:03:52,499
We <i>are</i> clear.

667
01:03:53,601 --> 01:03:58,303
It took Johnny at most
36 hours from exposure.

668
01:03:58,305 --> 01:04:01,473
So obviously we have
to wait 36 hours

669
01:04:01,475 --> 01:04:04,276
- from when we destroyed the eggs.
- We're making port tonight.

670
01:04:04,278 --> 01:04:06,713
Freya, if any of us
is infected, then...

671
01:04:06,715 --> 01:04:08,614
Then we'll be better off
in hospital.

672
01:04:08,616 --> 01:04:11,619
Freya, wait!
You know Christmas Island?

673
01:04:12,853 --> 01:04:14,186
- What?
- It has the world's

674
01:04:14,188 --> 01:04:17,389
biggest population of red
crabs, it used to.

675
01:04:17,391 --> 01:04:19,991
- So?
- So, a few yellow ants arrived

676
01:04:19,993 --> 01:04:23,195
and they blinded the red crabs.
Just a few ants.

677
01:04:23,197 --> 01:04:25,330
Now there aren't
anymore red crabs.

678
01:04:25,332 --> 01:04:27,299
Do you see what I mean?

679
01:04:27,301 --> 01:04:30,202
Yeah. The crabs should
have gone to hospital.

680
01:04:30,204 --> 01:04:32,638
This is what I do.

681
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:35,207
- Faunal behavior in spe...
- Yes, in a lab.

682
01:04:35,209 --> 01:04:37,943
But this is the real world,
with real people!

683
01:04:37,945 --> 01:04:40,011
And in the real world,
if we go ashore

684
01:04:40,013 --> 01:04:41,514
and one of us is a carrier,

685
01:04:41,516 --> 01:04:43,683
then those things will spread,
really fast.

686
01:04:43,685 --> 01:04:45,852
Sudi is my responsibility.

687
01:04:45,854 --> 01:04:47,319
And he's bleeding
to death in there.

688
01:04:47,321 --> 01:04:48,857
We can't just
think about Sudi.

689
01:04:52,426 --> 01:04:55,864
I am not losing
one more crew member.

690
01:05:00,367 --> 01:05:02,535
Omid, I need your help.

691
01:05:02,537 --> 01:05:03,935
Yeah, what?

692
01:05:03,937 --> 01:05:06,373
When we get to port, help me
keep everyone on the boat.

693
01:05:07,542 --> 01:05:08,741
That'll never happen.

694
01:05:08,743 --> 01:05:11,376
First sniff of land, we'll
all be off and gone.

695
01:05:11,378 --> 01:05:14,379
Just until we know
we're not infected!

696
01:05:14,381 --> 01:05:16,248
Have you seen Sudi?

697
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:17,517
Have you seen him?

698
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:18,952
He needs help now.

699
01:05:20,421 --> 01:05:21,920
Where do you live?

700
01:05:23,424 --> 01:05:24,757
Galway.

701
01:05:24,759 --> 01:05:26,391
200,000 people
in Galway, right?

702
01:05:26,393 --> 01:05:28,126
- Yeah, it's about that.
- Yeah. We can't say

703
01:05:28,128 --> 01:05:30,095
we're so important that it's
worth risking the lives

704
01:05:30,097 --> 01:05:31,697
of 200,000 people.

705
01:05:31,699 --> 01:05:33,766
Yeah, maybe.

706
01:05:33,768 --> 01:05:36,301
But who are you to say that
this poor kid has to die

707
01:05:36,303 --> 01:05:38,638
so someone else
can avoid the risk?

708
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:06,133
Are my eyes open or closed?

709
01:06:08,368 --> 01:06:10,302
Open.

710
01:06:20,515 --> 01:06:22,216
Shh, you'll be alright.

711
01:06:23,818 --> 01:06:25,587
Shhhh.

712
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:28,623
You'll be alright.

713
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:46,137
Sudi?

714
01:07:26,413 --> 01:07:29,180
God is our hope and strength.

715
01:07:29,182 --> 01:07:31,383
God is our hope.

716
01:07:31,385 --> 01:07:33,351
We will not fear,

717
01:07:33,353 --> 01:07:36,522
though we be in
the midst of the sea,

718
01:07:51,204 --> 01:07:56,945
God is with us,
and we will not be removed.

719
01:07:59,714 --> 01:08:01,015
Amen.

720
01:08:20,902 --> 01:08:22,602
We need to quarantine
ourselves now.

721
01:08:22,604 --> 01:08:25,071
Maybe you've no life,
but we have responsibilities.

722
01:08:25,073 --> 01:08:28,574
Listen.
Omid's wife is pregnant.

723
01:08:28,576 --> 01:08:30,042
We need to get them home.

724
01:08:30,044 --> 01:08:31,978
If they want, they can
get themselves to hospital.

725
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:34,446
- Now seriously, fuck off!
- But you don't understand!

726
01:08:34,448 --> 01:08:36,882
Did you not hear me?!

727
01:08:36,884 --> 01:08:38,352
Huh?!

728
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:10,484
You okay?

729
01:09:42,282 --> 01:09:43,316
How's Ger?

730
01:09:44,384 --> 01:09:46,654
Not infected if that's
what you mean.

731
01:10:02,036 --> 01:10:05,205
Aw, no.
Oh, no, no, no!

732
01:10:14,214 --> 01:10:17,250
Fucking... Fuck...
Come here.

733
01:10:28,328 --> 01:10:29,997
Why has the engine stopped?

734
01:10:30,698 --> 01:10:32,098
Tell them.

735
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:33,701
I disabled the boat.

736
01:10:34,902 --> 01:10:36,070
What?

737
01:10:37,605 --> 01:10:38,873
I disabled the boat.

738
01:10:39,707 --> 01:10:41,907
- Agh!
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

739
01:10:41,909 --> 01:10:44,877
What the fuck's
your problem?!

740
01:10:44,879 --> 01:10:47,113
- We've all got cuts.
- But we killed the eggs!

741
01:10:47,115 --> 01:10:48,748
We could have got infected
before that!

742
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:51,384
- So we get help!
- There is no help!

743
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:01,461
So...

744
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:05,131
You want us to sit
out here and die?

745
01:11:05,133 --> 01:11:07,800
I want us to stay on the boat
until we're sure

746
01:11:07,802 --> 01:11:09,668
that none of us is infected.

747
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:12,640
- Your bloody 36 hours.
- It's not mine.

748
01:11:14,542 --> 01:11:15,777
It's your family's.

749
01:11:19,113 --> 01:11:21,916
It's your husband's,
it's your baby's.

750
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:23,682
Blame me if you want.

751
01:11:23,684 --> 01:11:26,284
We have to take action.

752
01:11:26,286 --> 01:11:28,288
We have to
take responsibility.

753
01:11:53,981 --> 01:11:58,052
Listen,
I know I caused this.

754
01:11:59,787 --> 01:12:00,822
Don't.

755
01:12:06,426 --> 01:12:08,162
I let you do it.

756
01:12:10,031 --> 01:12:12,533
We could have gone back home
when that thing let us go,

757
01:12:14,168 --> 01:12:15,335
but I kept us here.

758
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:17,468
It's not all on you.

759
01:12:19,607 --> 01:12:21,309
God knows who's next.

760
01:12:29,083 --> 01:12:31,719
You saw something in Johnny's
eye before he died, didn't you?

761
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:34,019
Yes.

762
01:12:34,021 --> 01:12:36,190
I want you to test all of us.

763
01:12:50,838 --> 01:12:52,638
I don't see anything.

764
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,642
- Want me to do you?
- Mm-hmm.

765
01:13:00,715 --> 01:13:02,884
- I don't see anything.
- Look again. It's really faint.

766
01:13:13,361 --> 01:13:14,526
No, I don't see anything.

767
01:13:14,528 --> 01:13:15,796
Do me.

768
01:13:17,698 --> 01:13:18,866
Not you. Omid.

769
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,600
Come on. Just let her do it.

770
01:13:37,251 --> 01:13:38,918
I think you're fine.

771
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:40,788
Okay. My turn.

772
01:13:50,097 --> 01:13:51,732
I don't see anything.

773
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,735
- Okay.
- She scuppered us for nothing.

774
01:13:56,137 --> 01:13:57,238
You haven't done me.

775
01:13:58,471 --> 01:13:59,573
I don't need to do you.

776
01:14:02,109 --> 01:14:03,144
What?

777
01:14:05,179 --> 01:14:06,280
Give me that thing.

778
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:33,839
Fuck!

779
01:14:33,841 --> 01:14:36,642
- Oh, God, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- It's alright, it's okay.

780
01:14:36,644 --> 01:14:39,178
It's okay, it's alright.

781
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:42,116
- It's alright.
- No. No. Listen.

782
01:14:44,218 --> 01:14:46,785
- That place.
- Gerard, no.

783
01:14:46,787 --> 01:14:48,954
We weren't meant to be there.

784
01:14:48,956 --> 01:14:50,789
- What?
- What do you mean?

785
01:14:50,791 --> 01:14:53,692
I changed course and I didn't
tell anyone.

786
01:14:53,694 --> 01:14:56,195
I took us into
an exclusion zone.

787
01:14:56,197 --> 01:14:57,665
That's why we saw the whales.

788
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:00,599
Come on.

789
01:15:00,601 --> 01:15:02,868
- You changed course?
- I changed course.

790
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:04,839
So do the Coast Guards
know where we are?

791
01:15:09,877 --> 01:15:10,878
Did you know about this?

792
01:15:12,046 --> 01:15:13,047
Hmm?

793
01:15:13,948 --> 01:15:15,182
- Ger, come on.
- Ciara...

794
01:15:17,218 --> 01:15:20,185
- I think you should go.
- Come on.

795
01:15:20,187 --> 01:15:22,421
- You fucking bastard!
- Stop it!

796
01:15:22,423 --> 01:15:24,189
- Johnny's dead!
- We're family!

797
01:15:24,191 --> 01:15:26,827
Oh, yeah?
I had my own family.

798
01:15:41,409 --> 01:15:42,743
I'm so sorry.

799
01:15:44,278 --> 01:15:45,713
I'm sorry.

800
01:15:48,049 --> 01:15:49,250
I'm so sorry.

801
01:16:05,032 --> 01:16:06,834
Little blondie head on her.

802
01:16:09,003 --> 01:16:11,703
Little Niamh.

803
01:16:11,705 --> 01:16:15,009
I thought nothing this bad
could ever happen to us again.

804
01:16:17,478 --> 01:16:19,280
I don't mind going.

805
01:16:20,448 --> 01:16:22,316
'Cause I'll see her again.

806
01:16:26,754 --> 01:16:28,055
Wait!

807
01:16:32,226 --> 01:16:33,294
Wait!

808
01:16:35,663 --> 01:16:36,795
Wait!

809
01:16:55,349 --> 01:16:56,784
O, a chuisle...

810
01:17:32,186 --> 01:17:33,487
Freya.

811
01:17:36,457 --> 01:17:38,023
Freya!

812
01:18:05,819 --> 01:18:07,686
Are you taking a rowboat?

813
01:18:07,688 --> 01:18:09,154
Double your chances
of being found.

814
01:18:09,156 --> 01:18:10,489
Just stop, please! Listen!

815
01:18:10,491 --> 01:18:12,659
You're three fucking days
from shore in that thing!

816
01:18:12,661 --> 01:18:14,960
- Call it quarantine.
- Come on, Freya, please?

817
01:18:14,962 --> 01:18:17,029
There's white spirit and
stuff in the forepeak.

818
01:18:17,031 --> 01:18:19,998
Make a flare. There's also
the inflatable boat.

819
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,302
Hey, please.

820
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:24,606
What about the
Niamh Cinn-Oir, huh?

821
01:18:25,873 --> 01:18:27,408
Do what you want with it.

822
01:18:28,209 --> 01:18:29,777
It's just a boat.

823
01:19:20,828 --> 01:19:22,664
That's inside the boat.

824
01:19:44,686 --> 01:19:47,419
Freshwater?
They're alive in freshwater!

825
01:19:47,421 --> 01:19:49,254
- That sounded like one animal.
- Yeah.

826
01:19:49,256 --> 01:19:51,390
So they ate each other like
tadpoles. One animal wins.

827
01:19:51,392 --> 01:19:53,294
How... How do we get
the one animal out?

828
01:19:54,495 --> 01:19:55,595
We stun it.

829
01:19:55,597 --> 01:19:57,396
We run electricity
through the tank.

830
01:19:57,398 --> 01:19:59,701
No, that doesn't...
Only works in salt water.

831
01:20:01,935 --> 01:20:06,138
Okay. Okay, okay.
It's a parasitic life cycle.

832
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:07,640
It's hadopelagic.

833
01:20:07,642 --> 01:20:10,042
But pressure is not a problem.

834
01:20:10,044 --> 01:20:11,245
Yeah?

835
01:20:12,681 --> 01:20:14,415
It's um...

836
01:20:17,951 --> 01:20:19,053
It's hadopelagic.

837
01:20:20,321 --> 01:20:21,621
Yeah, you said that.

838
01:20:21,623 --> 01:20:23,822
So it likes the deep cold.
We heat the tank.

839
01:20:23,824 --> 01:20:25,957
- What, will that kill it?
- No.

840
01:20:25,959 --> 01:20:28,460
- But it will slow it down.
- Enough for us to kill it?

841
01:20:28,462 --> 01:20:30,996
Enough for us to safely
return it to the wild.

842
01:20:30,998 --> 01:20:32,699
Oh, wait, what like,
are you insane?

843
01:20:32,701 --> 01:20:34,433
- It's a rare animal.
- Yeah, so are we.

844
01:20:34,435 --> 01:20:36,669
- We're intelligent.
- T-That's debatable.

845
01:20:36,671 --> 01:20:39,371
This is our duty!
It's in the wrong place.

846
01:20:39,373 --> 01:20:42,474
It only wants to survive.
Just like us.

847
01:20:42,476 --> 01:20:44,309
So you risk dying
to protect something

848
01:20:44,311 --> 01:20:45,680
that wants to kill you?

849
01:20:47,649 --> 01:20:49,283
How do we heat the tank?

850
01:21:11,706 --> 01:21:13,905
Let's find out.

851
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:19,781
Now?

852
01:21:31,693 --> 01:21:33,058
Omid!

853
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:34,128
Agh!

854
01:21:48,810 --> 01:21:50,911
Right through the hull.

855
01:21:59,687 --> 01:22:00,753
Get the food.

856
01:22:00,755 --> 01:22:02,757
- We're sinking?
- We're sinking.

857
01:22:06,126 --> 01:22:08,160
White spirit.

858
01:22:08,162 --> 01:22:10,262
- We can make a beacon.
- With what?

859
01:22:15,904 --> 01:22:18,138
Okay, you ready?

860
01:22:19,741 --> 01:22:20,875
No.

861
01:22:23,878 --> 01:22:25,279
Let's go.

862
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:41,663
Omid! Hurry!

863
01:22:43,096 --> 01:22:45,197
I-I can't swim!

864
01:23:12,292 --> 01:23:14,696
Omid!

865
01:23:15,597 --> 01:23:16,796
Grab my hand!

866
01:23:16,798 --> 01:23:18,298
Grab my hand! Pull!

867
01:23:29,009 --> 01:23:30,977
No! No! Oh!

868
01:23:30,979 --> 01:23:32,778
Omid! Oh, carry on...!

869
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,215
Thank you!

870
01:24:43,785 --> 01:24:45,252
Thank you...

871
01:24:51,726 --> 01:24:53,061
Siobhan.

872
01:24:54,028 --> 01:24:56,731
Siobhan. Look! Look!

873
01:25:21,355 --> 01:25:22,690
I'm infected.

874
01:25:31,666 --> 01:25:33,701
No. Let me see.

875
01:25:37,839 --> 01:25:40,074
Okay. We'll just...

876
01:25:44,078 --> 01:25:45,680
Okay, we'll, listen...

877
01:25:46,114 --> 01:25:47,481
We'll just...

878
01:25:53,121 --> 01:25:55,186
We'll just tourniquet
this area, okay?

879
01:25:55,188 --> 01:25:57,089
Stop the poison
from spreading.

880
01:25:57,091 --> 01:25:58,824
Okay. Yeah?

881
01:25:58,826 --> 01:26:01,292
Hey. You might be immune.

882
01:26:01,294 --> 01:26:03,163
Okay? We're going home.

883
01:26:08,402 --> 01:26:10,170
- Okay.
- Omid...

884
01:26:11,839 --> 01:26:13,107
Omid...

885
01:28:35,785 --> 01:28:39,018
