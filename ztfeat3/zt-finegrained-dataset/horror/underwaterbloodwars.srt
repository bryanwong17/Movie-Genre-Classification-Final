1
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,635
<i>I was an elite soldier
in the vampire army.</i>

2
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,439
<i>A Death Dealer.</i>

3
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,640
<i>And I was good at it.</i>

4
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,674
<i>But I was betrayed.</i>

5
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,635
<i>Viktor, our leader
and the most powerful vampire...</i>

6
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,719
<i>...was not the saviour
he had led me to believe.</i>

7
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,075
<i>Suddenly, allies turned enemies.</i>

8
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,473
<i>The vampire Elders I had once
protected wanted me dead.</i>

9
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,956
<i>Then I found Michael Corvin.</i>

10
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,114
<i>Neither vampire nor Lycan,
Michael became a hybrid.</i>

11
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,638
<i>We retaliated, killed the Elders.</i>

12
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,599
<i>But then everything changed.</i>

13
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,676
<i>I was captured, not knowing that I was
carrying Michael's child.</i>

14
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,839
<i>Eve, our daughter,
the first pure-blood hybrid...</i>

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,231
<i>...whose blood could end the war...</i>

16
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,837
<i>...became highly sought after
by both vampires and Lycans alike.</i>

17
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,910
<i>My only choice was to hide her
from the world and from myself...</i>

18
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,753
<i>...so not even I could lead them to her.</i>

19
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,590
<i>I was an elite soldier
in the vampire army.</i>

20
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,116
<i>My only choice was to hide her
from the world...</i>

21
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,430
<i>...so not even I could lead them to her.</i>

22
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,872
<i>I have lived beyond my time.</i>

23
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,829
<i>Another new moon
in 1000 years of new moons...</i>

24
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,160
<i>...and I do not care to see it.</i>

25
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,030
<i>I have nothing.</i>

26
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,755
<i>My coven...</i>

27
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,799
<i>...my daughter...</i>

28
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,873
<i>- ...my love, all gone.</i>
- Cut her off!

29
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,075
<i>And soon, perhaps...</i>

30
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,391
<i>...my very existence.</i>

31
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,516
- Selene's coming!
<i>- I am hunted by vampires and Lycans.</i>

32
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,350
<i>Now I am an outcast, a pariah.</i>

33
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,840
- Put her down!
- Remember, he wants her alive.

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,036
Fire!

35
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,639
Come on, now. Fire!

36
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,994
You are an extremely difficult person
to keep track of.

37
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,514
I don't need you.

38
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,316
But thank you.

39
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,596
Any word with Michael?

40
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,917
- Stop tracking me!
- I'm not tracking you.

41
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,315
I'm looking for Eve.

42
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,954
Well, I'm the very last person
who could help you find my daughter.

43
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,192
Selene, listen to me.
The Lycans are moving again.

44
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,830
No, this is different.

45
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,390
They're organised. They have a new leader.

46
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,438
- His name is Marius.
- I'm finished with this war.

47
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,875
Well, it's not finished with you.

48
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,710
They could have killed you but clearly
their mission was to capture you.

49
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,714
Your daughter's blood, it's a prize.

50
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,792
And if they find her, if they use it...

51
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,358
- ...Marius's power will be limitless.
- Well, then I hope she remains lost.

52
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,432
I need you to deliver a message.

53
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,717
Grunt if you understand.

54
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,272
Tell your Marius, if he thinks
he can extract information from me...

55
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,159
...to locate my daughter, he can't.

56
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,516
I don't know where she is,
and I don't want to know.

57
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,235
Marius will find you.

58
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,118
Do you understand your message?

59
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,958
What is it?

60
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,360
Have you seen this before?

61
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,795
No...

62
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,480
...but we need to get it out.

63
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,999
Let's go.

64
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,274
<i>Bravo one, over. Car approaching.</i>

65
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,750
<i>- Access cleared.
- Close the gates.</i>

66
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,714
<i>Commencing perimeter sweep.</i>

67
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,475
Privilege to welcome you home
at last, sir.

68
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,751
Semira awaits you in her private chambers.

69
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,673
Semira?

70
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,274
Where is Cassius?

71
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,113
The entire council will greet you,
of course, sir...

72
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,591
...but Semira requests just a few moments.

73
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,274
And your name is?

74
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,880
Varga, sir.

75
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,077
I shall try to remember it.

76
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,560
...and act accordingly
because of this tragic...

77
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,353
Leave us.

78
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,036
Darling Thomas. It has been...

79
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,590
- ...how long?
- Decades.

80
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,430
Congratulations.

81
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,920
I gather you have a seat on the council.

82
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,560
I could not be more proud.

83
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,150
It's a shame that your return is not
under more festive circumstances.

84
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,432
It is said that the Western Coven
was utterly destroyed.

85
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,716
Yes, it was.

86
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,837
It's a blessing
you escaped with your life.

87
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,674
Well, many did not.

88
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,196
There has been too much death
among our people.

89
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,353
These urns are all that remain
of our Budapest Coven.

90
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,477
Well, you have my condolences.

91
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,838
We are losing the war, Thomas.

92
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,277
If we stay as we are, our species
will be extinct within five years.

93
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,033
Does Cassius share your view?

94
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,989
The Lycans have regrouped, replenished,
and are resolved to exterminate us.

95
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,073
Oh, surely, you're safe here.
The Eastern Coven is a fortress.

96
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,391
We are no longer the coven you remember.

97
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,756
We have fewer Death Dealers
than ever before.

98
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,151
You seem to be surrounded by new cadets.

99
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,558
Raw recruits, neither combat-ready
nor numerous enough...

100
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,638
...to repel a large-scale Lycan attack.

101
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,672
There has never been
a large-scale Lycan attack.

102
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,398
At least not a coordinated one.

103
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,234
There has never been a Marius.

104
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,590
Pains me to admit it,
but for the first time in my life...

105
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,271
...I genuinely fear for our future.

106
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,271
So, what is your plan?

107
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,634
Semira, you always have a plan.

108
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,350
This little mise-en-scene
you're performing has a purpose.

109
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,835
I am not a mind reader.

110
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,832
Kindly do an old vampire the courtesy...

111
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,391
...of telling him why
he's been invited here.

112
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,073
Selene.

113
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,760
Come on. We need to keep moving.

114
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,276
There are safe houses
far closer than this.

115
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,318
I told you, they destroyed them.

116
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,233
It's different now. Come on.

117
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,559
But you signed her death warrant.

118
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,837
Of course. I despise her.

119
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,673
She killed Viktor. I was his regent.

120
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,395
Until he met Selene.

121
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,677
So you want her to hunt Marius?

122
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,433
I want her to train our new recruits...

123
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,553
...so we have 100 Death Dealers
hunting Marius.

124
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,112
I doubt she will agree.

125
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,999
Her only concern is for her daughter.

126
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,389
Eve, the hybrid.

127
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,473
Unfortunately, the poor girl
is half Lycan.

128
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,713
It's a vampire's instinct to condescend to
Lycans, but they're not afraid to evolve.

129
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,475
Meanwhile, we stagnate from 1500 years...

130
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,792
...of this damned "species purity"
nonsense.

131
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,038
And the irony is that Selene...

132
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,874
- ...is probably the purest of us all.
- So the rumour's true?

133
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,437
Her blood has elements
of the Corvinus strain?

134
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,478
She is special.

135
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,952
She brought my son back from the dead.

136
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,279
- Her blood restarted his heart.
- Impossible.

137
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,434
I witnessed it myself.
She saved my son's life.

138
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,640
Viktor and Amelia.

139
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,118
Side by side for eternity.

140
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,958
You were very fond of Amelia,
if I remember.

141
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,714
- I need you to be my ally on this.
- She won't risk coming here...

142
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,520
...unless she gets an invitation
from the whole council.

143
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,751
And I could never solicit such a request.

144
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,917
Cassius is protective of the old ways.

145
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,232
He barely tolerates my seat
on the council as it is.

146
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,514
But these are desperate times, Thomas.

147
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,430
And that is why you
must convince the council to invite her.

148
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,314
They arrive tonight.

149
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,678
<i>Dawn alert. 60 seconds to sunrise.</i>

150
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,912
Marius, the pack leaders have arrived...

151
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,470
...and I told them to wait
for you in the war room.

152
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,034
They're fighting like dogs, no doubt.

153
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,715
- I'll handle it. Thank you.
- All right.

154
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,794
- Go on, then.
- Right, right.

155
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,950
Come around, come around.

156
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,720
No! Listen to me.

157
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,917
We're gonna wedge them in.
That's what we do.

158
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,833
From this side and that side,
we just wedge them in...

159
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,559
- ...and squeeze them out.
- Wedge them in?

160
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,474
Is that your plan?
It's not going to lead to anything.

161
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,960
- He's getting angry.
- Shut up!

162
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,518
Stop!

163
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,472
- Are you a slave?
- No.

164
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,233
Then don't behave like one.

165
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,639
Look at this map.

166
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,433
What do you see?

167
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,478
Do you see Lycans fighting over scraps?

168
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,993
I'll tell you what I see.

169
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,915
Volhynia.

170
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,035
Nordgau. Thuringia.

171
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,270
The Lycan victories.

172
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,640
I see vampires dead.

173
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,359
I see entire regions annihilated.

174
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,876
But we will get no further
if we fight amongst ourselves.

175
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,234
We must not rest...

176
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,757
...until we have destroyed
their final sanctuary.

177
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,239
Together, we are strong.

178
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,670
And when we have the blood
of the hybrid girl...

179
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,637
...we will be invincible.

180
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,200
Gregor.

181
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,559
You have returned alone.

182
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,116
- We were taken by surprise.
- Where is Selene?

183
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,996
- She spared me.
- Why?

184
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,594
To deliver a message.

185
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,714
She wants you to know
that her daughter is gone forever...

186
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,439
...that you can never find her...

187
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,434
...because even Selene
doesn't know where she's been hidden.

188
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,710
Do you believe her?

189
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,429
Do you believe her?

190
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,840
I put a tracer in her companion.

191
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,874
Well...

192
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,959
...that means you're not
completely incompetent.

193
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,669
Try and stay still.

194
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,200
- What is it?
- It's some sort of bullet.

195
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,114
It's burrowing through you
faster than you can heal.

196
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,555
It's self-propelled.

197
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,157
That's what I was trying to tell you.
These Lycans are sophisticated.

198
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,271
I don't know if I can remove it in time.

199
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,591
Well, the least you can do
is attempt to sound reassuring.

200
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,879
I'm going to attempt not to kill you.

201
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,832
That will have to do.

202
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,909
To whom do you want us
to offer safe haven and amnesty?

203
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,676
- To Selene the Death Dealer.
- The same Selene who murdered Viktor?

204
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,752
I need no reminder, Cassius,
of what she has done.

205
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,070
Shame on you, sir.

206
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,119
I will not hear her name spoken again.

207
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,437
Cassius, I share your outrage.

208
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,357
Whatever has possessed you?

209
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,038
If we don't act decisively the war
will be at your gate within a fortnight.

210
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,155
And that is precisely
where it will remain.

211
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,472
No Lycan pack would dare
to attack our coven.

212
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,757
Our defences would rip them apart.

213
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,191
An ordinary Lycan pack, perhaps...

214
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,512
...but Marius has gathered a force
far more powerful than any...

215
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,000
Unsubstantiated hyperbole.

216
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,992
You need Selene.

217
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,791
Her prowess, her leadership,
her intimate knowledge of Lycans.

218
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,475
And her combat skills are second to none.

219
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,149
He's right, she is the most
lethal Death Dealer we've ever had.

220
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,876
But she killed one of her own.

221
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,080
Not only the most powerful
and respected of the Elders...

222
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,678
...her protector, who loved her
like his own daughter.

223
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,718
She cannot be trusted.

224
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,155
She has been judged.

225
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,880
Perhaps she can also be redeemed.

226
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,549
It pains me to say it,
but Thomas is right.

227
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,680
No warrior has proved herself
more in battle.

228
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,117
She would be invaluable
in our fight against Marius...

229
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,320
...perhaps even the pivotal element
to secure our victory.

230
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,871
If she can be found...

231
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,557
...and sets foot
within this precious coven...

232
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,878
...I will hold you, Semira,
personally responsible...

233
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,793
- ...for controlling her.
- Of course.

234
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,433
<i>Intruder. Intruder. Intruder.</i>

235
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,478
<i>Intruder. Intruder.</i>

236
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,519
Who sent you?

237
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,593
Drop it.

238
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,400
How'd you find us?

239
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,791
There are only a handful
of safe houses left.

240
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,916
The Lycans made it rather easy.

241
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,470
The council of the Eastern Coven
sent me to bring you in.

242
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,359
- For trial?
- No.

243
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,480
- For your safety, and ours.
- You cannot expect me to believe that.

244
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,911
Every single one of them
signed my death warrant.

245
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,197
- Times change.
- Vampires do not.

246
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,909
This is from your father.

247
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,317
Is it authentic?

248
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,557
It's his seal, his handwriting.

249
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,918
The council has offered you clemency
and granted us both safe haven.

250
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,878
- Why?
- Marius.

251
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,430
It is the council's humble request...

252
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,274
...that you train us
to defeat him and his army.

253
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,115
Move. Come on.

254
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,919
The signal's coming from this way.

255
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,999
Look, I understand you're reluctant...

256
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,994
...but as guests of the council,
we will be protected by law.

257
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,311
My father wouldn't lie,
and he holds no grudge.

258
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,439
- He had no love for Viktor, either.
<i>- Intruder. Intruder.</i>

259
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,751
- Lycans.
<i>- Intruder.</i>

260
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,919
- We must leave.
- You should accept the council's offer.

261
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,992
- For Eve.
- Eve does not want my help.

262
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,516
I know you want to protect her.
And if we destroy Marius...

263
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,831
...we destroy the greatest threat
to her safety.

264
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,275
Now.

265
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,440
Marius.

266
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,154
We just missed them.

267
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,870
I do not wish to hear
the word "just" again.

268
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,631
Either we have her or we have nothing.

269
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,839
Do you understand?

270
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,071
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

271
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,593
<i>Tango Charlie approaching.</i>

272
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,160
<i>All clear.</i>

273
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,319
<i>Perimeter secure.</i>

274
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,839
- Welcome.
- Am I?

275
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,560
Our coven's resources
and weaponry are yours...

276
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,270
...to transform these raw recruits into
Death Dealers worthy of your name.

277
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,597
Varga will be your right-hand man.

278
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,479
He knows all our strengths and weaknesses.

279
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,236
He is also our most prolific Lycan killer
with over 40 confirmed kills.

280
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,312
- It's an honour.
- David, welcome.

281
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,200
- Thank you.
- To mark the safe arrival of our guests...

282
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,511
...I've arranged a little soiree
in the Winter Garden.

283
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,519
There's really no need. Thank you.

284
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,434
Nonsense. There's always a need
to indulge in pleasure.

285
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,679
In times of war...

286
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,674
...this coven needs moments to celebrate.

287
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,800
The arrival of Thomas, David and Selene...

288
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,919
...is reason aplenty to rejoice.

289
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,277
To us all.

290
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,516
It's good of you to offer us
sanctuary, Semira. Thank you.

291
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,155
It will be entirely my pleasure.

292
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,070
Tell me, is it true that her blood
brought you back to life?

293
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,640
Yes, it is.

294
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,553
I owe her everything.

295
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,116
But, if you'll excuse me,
my father requests my counsel.

296
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,113
Thomas was always such a bore.

297
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,272
Well, Semira's certainly taken
an interest in you.

298
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,194
Well, the interest
is certainly not mutual.

299
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,636
We need her protection.

300
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,440
On the contrary,
I think I need protection from her.

301
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,273
The Battle of the Peste.

302
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,350
We thought it would be
the one to end the war...

303
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,920
...the final conflict...

304
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,912
...but here we are still.

305
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,756
I hope you see my bid for clemency
for Selene for what it is.

306
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,673
Well, clemency
is the least you can offer her...

307
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,194
...after bartering her daughter
to the Lycans.

308
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,990
I lost so much during this war.

309
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,517
Believe me, I am haunted still
by all those I failed.

310
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,240
Well, then you must help me protect her.

311
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,392
She has lost even more
than we can imagine.

312
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,597
And she's important to me.

313
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,190
Marius is out there...

314
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,513
...reeking of canine insolence,
plotting our downfall.

315
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,200
We do not need Selene to destroy him.

316
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,753
I am more than capable.

317
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,435
No, Varga, you are merely adequate.

318
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,116
It's fortunate that we're not forced
to rely on your skills for our survival.

319
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,632
That, my sweet...

320
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,230
...yet unimaginative bedfellow...

321
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,754
...is my area of expertise.

322
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,673
- I think you should...
- Don't think, Varga.

323
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,593
You'll hurt yourself.

324
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,400
There are other ways
to prove your devotion.

325
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,118
Piece by delicate piece...

326
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,994
...the puzzle will fall into place.

327
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,951
Oh, yeah...

328
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,919
Yeah...

329
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,111
Don't aim where the Lycan is. Anticipate.

330
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,510
And remember...

331
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,036
...a Lycan is never more vulnerable
than when he's in wolf form.

332
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,759
- What?
- That makes no sense.

333
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,114
In wolf form, they cannot use weapons...

334
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,636
...and their thinking
becomes much more primitive...

335
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,035
...driven only by bloodlust.

336
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,954
- How many have you killed?
- I don't keep track.

337
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,239
I'm increasing Lycan speed by 20 percent.

338
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,398
Please continue.

339
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,434
My pack has probed the Eastern
Coven's perimeter for weaknesses...

340
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,590
...and there are none.

341
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,752
And any direct assault
would trigger the lockdown...

342
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,320
...which makes the coven impregnable.

343
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,279
Even if we could break inside
without losing 90 percent of our force...

344
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,874
- ...they have fallback positions...
- This.

345
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,794
- ...that can be...
- Is this ready?

346
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,633
Yeah.

347
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,269
When we have the hybrid's blood...

348
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,193
...we launch against the Eastern.

349
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,636
Find Selene, and we find her daughter.

350
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,432
My own invention.

351
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,273
One of the first things
a Death Dealer must learn...

352
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,840
...is how to fight in a confined space.

353
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,516
Of course, the one thing this training
session lacks is unpredictability.

354
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,235
Perhaps you'll indulge me
and give my students...

355
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,719
I should say your students.
...a lesson in combat's unpredictability.

356
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,760
It would not only honour us, but
it would be invaluable to their training.

357
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,752
- I don't...
- Please.

358
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,000
That's enough.

359
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,232
Gather round.
We are going to school you...

360
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,438
...in the true nature
of the Lycan warrior.

361
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,640
For the sake of this lesson,
our esteemed guest Selene...

362
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,197
...will play the role of Death Dealer
bravely defending our fortress...

363
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,956
...and I will take the role
of Lycan villain...

364
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,679
...here to destroy it.

365
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,320
Ladies first.

366
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,270
Impressive.

367
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,554
Come on.

368
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,796
Come on.

369
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,354
Tonight's lesson:

370
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,911
Do not trust your opponent
to fight with honour.

371
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,117
They are Lycan. They have none.

372
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,675
Don't move.

373
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,792
Nightshade.

374
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,395
Leeches into vampire cells, usually fatal.

375
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,792
But for one with her strength,
there will only be pain...

376
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,195
...followed by paralysis.

377
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,919
I'll kill you.

378
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,237
UV bullets.

379
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,357
Did you honestly think
I would forgive you for killing Viktor?

380
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,398
Varga, you have orders.

381
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,194
Varga!

382
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,992
I don't need you to train Death Dealers.

383
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,072
I have Varga for that.

384
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,914
All that I need to rule this coven...

385
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,836
...and end the march of the Lycans
is your blood.

386
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,360
What about the bodies?

387
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,194
Sound the alarm.

388
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,951
Have the council find them.

389
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:34,394
Conclusive evidence of the atrocity
committed by Selene.

390
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,029
There's been a breach.

391
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,796
We need to find Selene.

392
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,397
- Cordoned off. Semira's orders.
- Step aside.

393
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,109
David.

394
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,555
Come.

395
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,232
There's more than one way
to move around this coven.

396
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,319
Amelia created these passageways
centuries ago.

397
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,436
Where does this lead?

398
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,230
To the private chambers,
including Semira's.

399
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,753
What the hell have they done to her?

400
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,038
<i>Machina sanguinem exhauri.</i>

401
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,715
Bloodletting.

402
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,353
Semira wants Selene's most precious asset.

403
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,431
- This is going to kill her.
- Eventually, yes...

404
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,274
...but it will be agonisingly slow.

405
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,799
Look.

406
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,431
This is designed to open the arteries
as wide as possible.

407
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,911
If we're not very careful,
we will do her more harm than good.

408
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,760
Careful.

409
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,158
Is this hers?

410
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,310
Yes.

411
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,075
Selene uses only this particular weapon.

412
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,798
A known traitor within our walls.

413
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,593
This is precisely what I foresaw...

414
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,071
...and what you assured me
you would prevent.

415
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,158
Their blood is upon your hands.

416
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,357
- Sir, I did everything...
- Do not speak to me.

417
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,749
There can be no mercy.

418
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,480
I want her hunted
to the ends of the Earth.

419
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,558
It shall be done.

420
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,952
And I want her captured alive.

421
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,837
Is that understood?

422
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,912
Perfectly.

423
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,637
- We're running out of time.
- All right, take her.

424
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,757
You must go north, far north.

425
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,440
Var Dohr.

426
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,595
No.

427
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,752
Father and son united in treason.

428
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,593
Carry on with Selene.

429
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,750
I'll deal with them.

430
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,150
Come on.

431
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,835
Go! Now!

432
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,154
No!

433
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,398
<i>Dawn alert. 60 seconds to sunrise.</i>

434
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,280
Go ahead. The sun will burn you
to ashes out there...

435
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,432
...or you can die with some grace in here.

436
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,554
They can walk in the sun.

437
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,555
You need to feed.
You've lost too much blood.

438
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,394
That child... Because he
helped that child of yours.

439
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,995
My son is dead. Dead.

440
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,236
David.

441
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,350
Take her now.

442
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,159
You must go north. Var Dohr.

443
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,519
Go! Now!

444
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,839
Thank you.

445
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,440
I'm very sorry that you lost your father.

446
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,400
He put up a valiant fight.

447
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,157
It's strange to lose someone
you feel like you never really knew.

448
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,231
I feel the same about my mother, but...

449
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,477
I have almost no memory of her.

450
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,233
And I of Eve.

451
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,318
I didn't want her.

452
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,320
I didn't know her.

453
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,230
And now I've lost her.

454
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,676
Why do you insist on saying
that you've lost her?

455
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,750
She made me promise
I would never look for her...

456
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,640
...that I would never consider myself
having a daughter.

457
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,635
And she was right.

458
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,955
Nothing good has come to anyone I love.

459
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,871
You're family, and you're all I have left.

460
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,318
Well, then, you really are in trouble.

461
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,237
You need to rest.

462
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,237
Selene's clearly in league
with the Lycans.

463
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,519
Thomas and David were complicit
in this treachery.

464
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,071
They walked in the sun. This alone
is evidence of Lycan collusion.

465
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,199
Selene must be wiped from the pages
of our proud history.

466
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,436
Alexia.

467
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,513
- We shall avenge our fallen.
- See to it that you do.

468
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,754
- How much nightshade did you use?
- I thought it best to err on the side...

469
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,316
Varga, what have we said
about you thinking?

470
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,513
The poison will dissipate.

471
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,957
I need this blood untainted,
and I need it now.

472
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,271
It cannot be rushed.

473
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,120
It must run its course.

474
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,273
It's definitely the car.

475
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,831
But no sign of where they went.

476
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,073
Spread out across the city.

477
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,799
Search everywhere.

478
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,477
<i>The train at platform four
terminates at this station.</i>

479
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,874
Northbound.

480
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,194
I will be more powerful...

481
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,357
...than Cassius...

482
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,717
...than any vampire in this coven.

483
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,235
- What news of the search?
- Selene and David are heading north.

484
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,750
- Of course they are.
- Your Grace?

485
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,912
They will run to the only
remaining coven...

486
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,312
...to afford them safe haven:
Var Dohr, the Nordic fortress.

487
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,233
But Var Dohr is only a legend.

488
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,915
I would not give it
such an elevated status.

489
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:38,512
It is a frigid, dreary outpost
full of pathetic, peace-loving cowards.

490
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,070
You speak of it
as if you have actually been there.

491
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:45,519
Where do you think I was
when Viktor wasted years with Selene?

492
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,393
Prepare yourself.

493
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,359
The journey's long,
and I need you to take it alone.

494
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,670
I must be certain the traitor's there...

495
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,754
...before I risk sending a full squad of
Death Dealers so far from this coven.

496
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,633
You need to be more careful.

497
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,919
You need to be more gentle.

498
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,119
- Have you found Selene?
- Yes.

499
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,357
She is headed for the Nordic Coven.

500
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,480
I risk everything for this.

501
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,600
- For you, for us.
- I know, my love.

502
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,071
Semira grows more insane
for power with each day.

503
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,879
She must be stopped.

504
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,033
And every day, I fear more
what she will do if we are discovered.

505
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,673
I cannot attack the Eastern Coven
without the blood of the hybrid.

506
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,719
It's too strong, even for my horde.

507
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,479
Selene...

508
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:25,359
She is the key to the futures
of Lycans and vampires alike.

509
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,757
You shall have her.

510
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,316
Var Dohr is just beyond that ridge.

511
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,158
Where is everyone?

512
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,633
Watching.

513
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,635
We come seeking sanctuary...

514
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,439
...not to fight.

515
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,877
Then you've come to the right place.

516
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,718
My name is Lena.

517
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,712
Follow me.

518
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,639
What was that?

519
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,712
Some kind of trick.

520
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,394
You must be Selene.

521
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,395
Does the great Death Dealer
truly come in peace?

522
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,992
- I do.
- And what about this one?

523
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,396
This is David, son of Thomas.

524
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,076
Who I haven't seen for many, many years.

525
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,758
You must excuse the attention.

526
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,317
Our coven doesn't receive
many guests, by design.

527
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,470
We do as we wish...

528
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,235
- ...not as others would have us do.
- And what of the Lycans?

529
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,756
We are too far removed
for them to take notice...

530
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:31,119
...and even if they did, our climate
is quite an obstacle to warm-bloods.

531
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,637
This coven wouldn't exist...

532
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,395
- ...without your mother's grace.
- You knew my mother?

533
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,153
All vampires do, my boy.

534
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,670
No. My mother was low-born.
She died giving birth to me.

535
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,197
A falsehood, you will find, designed
to keep your true lineage safe.

536
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,794
- Is she still alive?
- No.

537
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:49,319
And her death
was a terrible blow to our kind.

538
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,154
The mourning ceremony we held
lasted for an entire month.

539
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,040
Such an honour
is usually reserved for a high-born...

540
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,793
- ...a Grand Elder.
- Yes.

541
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,033
- Amelia.
- Yes.

542
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,715
How could a Grand Elder
have been my mother...

543
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,075
...and I not been told?

544
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,592
I have something for you.

545
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,870
Your father's greatest work,
infused with silver.

546
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,635
The Lycans will cower
from the very sight of it.

547
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,360
- It's beautiful.
- Thomas knew that one day...

548
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,751
...you would be beset
by enemies on both sides...

549
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:35,996
...and he was right.

550
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,517
David, this means that you are
the rightful heir of the Eastern Coven.

551
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,479
Your mother and father
spent many months...

552
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,791
...within the safety of these walls.

553
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,800
Viktor grew suspicious.

554
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,077
Then your father spirited you away...

555
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,756
...before Semira arrived with her troops.

556
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,113
- And what of my mother?
- She returned to the Eastern Coven.

557
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,475
The light in her eyes...

558
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,519
Don't try and fabricate
some kind of martyrdom for her.

559
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,114
I prefer a more honest
appraisal of her decision.

560
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,917
She abandoned her only son
for the sake of her precious council.

561
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,470
- Take it.
- David.

562
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,233
David.

563
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,956
Amelia asked me to give him this.

564
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,917
What do you need?

565
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,878
Nothing. I just need to be left alone.

566
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,593
Yes, I know the feeling.

567
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,158
Why didn't my father
tell me about my mother?

568
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,199
I did not know your father well...

569
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,835
...but I know that his greatest fear
was to lose you.

570
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,710
It seems it's the curse of every parent
to disappoint their child.

571
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,792
At least you fought
for your child, Selene.

572
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,189
Yes, and lost.

573
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,839
You have pure-blood heritage, David.
Your mother was an Elder.

574
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,476
Your parents kept you safe for a reason.

575
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:04,439
They protected you
so that one day you could lead.

576
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,920
Your mother left you a gift.

577
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,636
Oh, that's very kind of you,
but I have no use for jewellery.

578
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,996
The ring is not the gift.

579
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,880
It contains the gift: a mother's love.

580
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,037
A single drop of her blood.

581
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,398
Maybe it'll help you decide.

582
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,153
You're just in time.

583
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,479
- Come.
- What is this?

584
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,792
- Valissa, the in-between place.
- Is she dead?

585
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,872
No.

586
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,553
She is...

587
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,470
...becoming.

588
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,955
She took a poison.

589
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,152
It allows her to visit the Sacred World.

590
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,792
When she returns,
she will see this world with new eyes.

591
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,800
I don't understand what this is.

592
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,152
We have long known
there is more than just this world.

593
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,036
When my father
first brought me down here...

594
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,680
...I felt as you do now...

595
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:36,834
...but I have since been
to the Sacred World many times.

596
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,914
My eyes see beyond the surface
of so many things.

597
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,600
- I see much about you.
- Such as?

598
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:48,595
I can see you've loved a Lycan,
killed a vampire Elder...

599
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,672
- ...and given birth...
- Stop.

600
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:57,397
I see you have lost your daughter...

601
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,029
...and how much pain
this gives you deep inside...

602
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,157
...where you will always hide it.

603
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,234
She's a special child.

604
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,676
Many battles will be fought...

605
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,517
...and lost over her.

606
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,791
- What else do you see?
- Darkness.

607
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,713
One that touches us all.

608
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:21,114
If you want to keep her safe,
you will need to go further...

609
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,240
...than even a warrior of your renown
has ever ventured before.

610
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,160
I have seen so much war...

611
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,431
...so much killing.

612
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,750
I cannot bear more.

613
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,310
The peace you will feel here is real.

614
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,917
It seeps into your skin
and comforts your soul.

615
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,112
Tell me about the Sacred World.

616
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,036
The water is the path.

617
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,430
<i>Amelia!</i>

618
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,835
<i>I name our son David.</i>

619
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,354
<i>David.</i>

620
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,551
<i>One day, you will understand.</i>

621
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,235
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

622
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,960
Lycans! Sound the alarm!

623
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,190
Close the doors!

624
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,274
Move!

625
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,516
Just as I spoke of peace,
war has followed you here.

626
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,875
Protect your own.

627
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,759
I must find David.

628
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,879
- We have to get you away.
- No. We led the Lycans here.

629
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,390
We can't let these people die.

630
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,313
Run!

631
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,070
This way, men.

632
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,957
Go around that side.

633
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,595
There she is.

634
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,474
You parasite.

635
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:27,875
Just do it.

636
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,350
Marius.

637
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,634
At last.

638
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,070
On your right!

639
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,074
I expected more from you.

640
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,160
Tell me where your daughter is.

641
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,517
I don't know.

642
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:58,152
Selene, all I want is her blood.

643
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,315
Only she can end this war.

644
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:16,960
I give you my word she will not be killed.

645
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:45,950
What are you?

646
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,110
Tell him where she is...

647
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,511
...and all this butchery
will be over forever.

648
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,751
I don't know.

649
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,513
Lies.

650
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,830
They've gone.

651
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,354
<i>Michael.</i>

652
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:30,199
- I freed you.
<i>- Look at the eyes.</i>

653
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,593
<i>Who I am? Do you not know who I am?</i>

654
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,672
<i>- My daughter.
- I don't want you.</i>

655
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,593
<i>Don't look for me.</i>

656
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,553
She's telling the truth.

657
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:42,950
She doesn't know.

658
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,630
My time is done.

659
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,431
They are retreating.

660
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,112
I'm running out of time.

661
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:21,630
We must strike against
the Eastern Coven now.

662
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,913
You know what you must do.

663
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:38,156
Water is the path.

664
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,794
Selene.

665
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,359
<i>Praise the day...</i>

666
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,593
<i>...when it ends.</i>

667
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,269
<i>Praise the ice...</i>

668
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,073
<i>...when it holds.</i>

669
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,075
<i>Praise the sword...</i>

670
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,717
<i>...when it kills.</i>

671
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,673
<i>Praise the life...</i>

672
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,552
<i>...that has lived.</i>

673
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,952
It's time.

674
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,000
Power.

675
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,675
Such a seductively simple thing.

676
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,272
Either you have it all
or you have nothing.

677
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,751
How fascinating.

678
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,596
<i>Amelia...</i>

679
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,710
<i>The water is the path.</i>

680
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,117
You should stay here, David.

681
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,476
This can be your home.

682
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,074
Marius is heading east.

683
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,754
There's nothing stopping him now.

684
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,359
And my people are beset
with enemies on all sides.

685
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,592
How can I stay here and live...

686
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,313
- ...while they die?
- They need a leader.

687
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,476
<i>Gate secure. Perimeter check.</i>

688
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,920
Miss me?

689
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:49,436
<i>- East gate is clear.
- West gate clear.</i>

690
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,392
<i>Commencing perimeter sweep.</i>

691
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:56,560
<i>Access granted.</i>

692
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,193
What news do you bring?

693
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:05,760
A massacre.

694
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,280
The Lycans attacked
the fortress of Var Dohr.

695
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,920
Lycans in the north.

696
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:16,312
The Nordic Coven
was taken completely by surprise.

697
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:20,236
- Dozens of vampires have been killed.
- Was Selene amongst them?

698
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:23,797
Dead. Killed by Marius himself.

699
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:26,395
Wherever Selene goes,
trouble surely follows.

700
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,916
- What of David?
- I do not know.

701
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:32,357
I only wished I had arrived sooner.
I might have helped in some way.

702
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:35,194
Well, you've helped in so many ways.

703
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:39,593
You've done exactly as I hoped
and planned, if not more.

704
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:44,919
You see, information is power.

705
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:53,030
And I collect it with a passion.

706
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:05,358
Thank you for leading Marius
to the Nordic Coven.

707
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,080
Your Lycan lover...

708
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:11,878
...must be delighted
with his momentary success.

709
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,272
You thought I didn't know.

710
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,191
Foolish girl.

711
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:31,559
<i>Dawn alert. 60 seconds to sunrise.</i>

712
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:39,840
The Lycan scourge
destroyed an entire coven.

713
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,117
To hide behind these walls
increases their advantage.

714
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,158
We cannot take the war to Marius.

715
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:46,516
Should we cower in the safety
of these walls...

716
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:50,276
- ...while he picks us off one by one?
- Curb your insidious comments, Semira.

717
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,955
This coven has held for 15 centuries.

718
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:56,796
- It will hold for 15 more.
- I hoped you would show strength...

719
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,556
...though I was willing
to settle for competence.

720
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:04,515
I was wrong.

721
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,277
What is the meaning of this?

722
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,160
If this council is too weak
to take action...

723
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,959
...it is my duty to do so.

724
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:19,990
You are relieved of your duties as
council members effective immediately.

725
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,477
The traitor returns.

726
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,995
Oh, you are a fool to show your face here.

727
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,797
I will make you pay
for what you've done, Semira.

728
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:35,277
Marius and his army
are heading this way as we speak.

729
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,800
- I come to save my people.
- Your people?

730
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,952
Kill him. Kill him.

731
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:43,550
You aspire to be the protector
of your bloodline...

732
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:46,189
...yet you kill your own kind
in pursuit of power.

733
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,396
It ends now.

734
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:51,631
I am David, son of the great Elder Amelia.

735
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:55,080
And I am the rightful heir to this coven.

736
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,517
Amelia had no son.

737
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,878
Well, she had the foresight...

738
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,350
...to know that my claim
would be challenged.

739
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,030
For the council.

740
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,634
Amelia.

741
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,439
His claim is true.

742
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,877
David is the last of the purebloods.

743
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,394
Irrelevant.
You are outnumbered and outgunned.

744
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,711
Varga, your orders still remain. Kill him.

745
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,839
- I said, "Kill him."
- No.

746
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,314
You swore to serve me.

747
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,631
I swore to protect
the leader of this house.

748
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,430
<i>Breach detected.</i>

749
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:11,271
<i>- Security system engaged.</i>
- Lycans. They're here.

750
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,194
Lock her away until she can be judged
by the council.

751
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,952
<i>Security system engaged.
Breach detected. Security system...</i>

752
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:23,320
- She gets her damn war after all.
- Varga, you can still be forgiven.

753
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:24,709
Gag her as well.

754
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,953
Come on, move that truck. Move it.

755
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,394
Watch your angles!

756
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:06,310
Let's go!

757
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,316
Hold your positions.

758
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,720
- On the staircase!
- Behind you!

759
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,720
- Fall back!
- Retreat!

760
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:38,276
Behind the balustrades!

761
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,359
Take them out!

762
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:55,516
- Come on!
- Move, move, move!

763
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,396
Move it!

764
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,313
Fuck.

765
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,872
Aim at the ready!

766
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,514
Fire!

767
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:43,994
Fire!

768
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,071
Hide from the light!

769
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,158
Run!

770
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:10,640
Move!

771
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,350
Shoot, shoot, shoot!

772
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,559
Impossible.

773
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:46,710
I saw you dead.

774
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,350
I'm here.

775
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:50,079
I brought backup.

776
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:59,430
There are too many of them.

777
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,750
I've already killed you.

778
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:33,355
Marius!

779
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:21,200
- Marius.
<i>- Please.</i>

780
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,312
I wish your father was alive to see this.

781
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,271
His ridiculous dream
of you ruling this coven...

782
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:13,278
...will be the very thing that kills you.

783
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,474
Missed.

784
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:31,800
Oh, it worked.

785
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:02,190
I'm one of you.

786
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,552
No! No! No!

787
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,719
You killed Michael.

788
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:25,034
This is the last of him.

789
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:13,471
<i>You're family, and you're all I have left.</i>

790
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:14,830
<i>Do you not know who I am?</i>

791
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,115
Your leader is dead.

792
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,157
Take your wounded. Leave.

793
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,280
Leave!

794
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:48,278
<i>We fought our greatest battle
in our darkest hour.</i>

795
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:52,796
<i>After centuries of war
between vampire and Lycan...</i>

796
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:55,919
<i>...this may at last be a time of peace.</i>

797
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:59,789
<i>We must once again tend to our wounded...</i>

798
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,434
<i>...honour our fallen.</i>

799
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:05,037
<i>Our final two covens
must find strength and unity...</i>

800
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,989
<i>...to heal and rise from the ashes.</i>

801
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:16,831
<i>My journey has now come full circle.</i>

802
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,233
<i>Once an outcast, I am now one
of three chosen Elders.</i>

803
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:23,596
<i>From hunted to the highest honour.</i>

804
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:51,516
<i>I have lived 1000 years.</i>

805
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:54,115
<i>I may live 1000 more...</i>

806
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:56,636
<i>...or I may die tomorrow.</i>

807
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,431
<i>But I no longer fear death...</i>

808
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:04,553
<i>...for I have known it once already.</i>

809
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:08,880
<i>I am reborn...</i>

810
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:11,999
<i>...and my eyes have been opened
to the Sacred World...</i>

811
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:14,994
<i>...and to the promise
of what is yet to be.</i>

812
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,837
<i>There is no beginning.</i>

813
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:22,152
<i>There is no end.</i>

814
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:25,676
<i>There is only becoming.</i>
