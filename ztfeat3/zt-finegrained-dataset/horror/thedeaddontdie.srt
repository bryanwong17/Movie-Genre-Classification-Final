2
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:30,675
Yuck.

3
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,948
The fire's still warm.

4
00:01:39,984 --> 00:01:43,588
Is that you, Hermit Bob?

5
00:01:44,622 --> 00:01:47,022
We kinda can see you.

6
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:49,625
Farmer Miller says
you might have stole

7
00:01:49,627 --> 00:01:51,194
one of his chickens.

8
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:53,865
That happens to be
against the law.

9
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:59,535
Now, I'm hoping that it was
a fox that did that.

10
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:02,807
Up your hole
with a wooden pole, Cliff.

11
00:02:08,813 --> 00:02:12,014
That also happens to be
against the law.

12
00:02:12,016 --> 00:02:14,452
Should we take him in?

13
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:19,588
Where'd he go?

14
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,659
I don't know.

15
00:02:27,665 --> 00:02:29,734
I don't see him.

16
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,038
Uh, we're gonna go back
to town now...

17
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,040
Hermit Bob.

18
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:41,510
Don't break any more laws.

19
00:02:41,512 --> 00:02:43,547
Just calm down.

20
00:02:59,563 --> 00:03:01,964
Hey, Cliff.

21
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:03,968

Should we bring him in
one of these days?

42
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:10,059
I mean...

43
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:13,564
he fired a weapon
at police officers.

44
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,866
Yeah, I don't know.

45
00:05:17,868 --> 00:05:20,571
I doubt he even stole
that chicken.

46
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,110
Farmer Miller
is such an asshole.

47
00:05:27,778 --> 00:05:30,079
I've known Bob
since junior high.

48
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:31,780
Oh, wow.

49
00:05:31,782 --> 00:05:35,017
That must have been
like 50 years ago.

50
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:37,886
Yeah, it was.

51
00:05:37,888 --> 00:05:40,722
You know, Bob's been out there
for years,

52
00:05:40,724 --> 00:05:42,225
eating squirrels and bugs,

53
00:05:42,227 --> 00:05:46,229
and he never hurt anyone
that I ever heard of.

54
00:05:46,231 --> 00:05:48,866
Well, he is kind of unusual.

55
00:05:52,204 --> 00:05:55,971
Is it already 20 after 8:00?

56
00:05:55,973 --> 00:05:58,241
Shouldn't it be
getting dark by now?

57
00:05:58,243 --> 00:06:00,142
Yeah, this
daylight savings thing

58
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:02,178
is all out of whack lately.

59
00:06:04,249 --> 00:06:06,218
Damn it.

60
00:06:08,052 --> 00:06:11,086
My watch stopped.

61
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:13,191
Or is broken or something.

62
00:06:16,026 --> 00:06:18,894
Yeah, something weird's
going on.

63
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:21,899
Yeah. Weird.

64
00:06:26,238 --> 00:06:29,740
Yeah, this isn't gonna
end well, Cliff.

65
00:06:54,031 --> 00:06:57,300
The ant colonies.

66
00:06:57,302 --> 00:07:01,071
All jacked up like it was
the end of the world.

67
00:07:15,953 --> 00:07:18,787
Hey, Ronnie,
you want to swing by the diner,

68
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:22,090
get some doughnuts, coffee?

69
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:24,960
Um... no, thanks.

70
00:07:24,962 --> 00:07:27,963
It seems late
for coffee and doughnuts.

71
00:07:27,965 --> 00:07:29,965
I guess so.

72
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:31,967
This is home base.

73
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:33,704
Are you guys reading me?
Over.

74
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:38,241
- Hey, Mindy.
- You guys okay out there?

75
00:07:38,243 --> 00:07:40,943
Yeah, we're just, uh,
cruising a bit

76
00:07:40,945 --> 00:07:43,213
before we swing on back.

77
00:07:43,215 --> 00:07:45,080
Uh, you need anything?

78
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:47,883
We could, uh, run by the diner,

79
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:50,286
pick you up
some coffee and doughnuts.

80
00:07:50,288 --> 00:07:51,987
Negative. Thanks.

81
00:07:51,989 --> 00:07:54,390
There is something strange
going on, though.

82
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:56,559
Have you guys, by any chance,
noticed that the...

83
00:07:56,561 --> 00:07:58,927
...and the daylight and the...

84
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:00,862
I think the news report...

85
00:08:02,267 --> 00:08:04,032
Hello, hello.

86
00:08:04,034 --> 00:08:06,169
Shit. We lost her.

87
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:08,173
Use your cell.

88
00:08:17,147 --> 00:08:19,349
That's funny.

89
00:08:19,351 --> 00:08:21,353
It's completely dead.

90
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,988
And it was fully charged.

91
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,957
Hey, Cliff, should we listen
to the civilian radio?

92
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,826

00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,307
Be out shortly, Frank.

122
00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:26,942
Just heating it up for you.

123
00:10:26,944 --> 00:10:30,179
Would you mind turning off
that goddamn music?

124
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:32,215
Fucking Sturgill Simpson.

125
00:10:32,217 --> 00:10:34,486
Sure thing.

126
00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:41,424
So, Frank,
what makes you so sure

127
00:10:41,426 --> 00:10:45,161
it's Hermit Bob
who stole your chicken?

128
00:10:45,163 --> 00:10:47,730
Well, who the hell else
could it be?

129
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:50,031
That goddamn hairy lunatic,

130
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:53,269
living out there
all these years like a caveman.

131
00:10:53,271 --> 00:10:55,405
Like some kind of ghost.

132
00:10:55,407 --> 00:10:58,307
Might as well be Amish.

133
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:01,310
Maybe it was a... a fox, Frank.

134
00:11:01,312 --> 00:11:04,213
Um, I don't think
Bob ever hurt anybody.

135
00:11:04,215 --> 00:11:07,483
Yeah, well, tell that
to my fucking chickens.

136
00:11:07,485 --> 00:11:11,052
Fox, my ass.

137
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:12,755
Here you go, Frank.

138
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:16,192
Want me to put that
in a to-go cup for you?

139
00:11:16,194 --> 00:11:19,295
Nah, I can't drink
any more of that stuff.

140
00:11:19,297 --> 00:11:21,499
It's too damn black for me.

141
00:11:26,304 --> 00:11:28,273
I meant it's too strong.

142
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,346
Take care, Frank.

143
00:11:37,348 --> 00:11:39,582
Yeah.

144
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:41,784
This special report:

145
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:44,320
These activities
could possibly be affecting

146
00:11:44,322 --> 00:11:46,422
the Earth's rotation
on its axis.

147
00:11:46,424 --> 00:11:48,491
Scientists say
even the slightest change

148
00:11:48,493 --> 00:11:51,059
in this balance
may already be causing

149
00:11:51,061 --> 00:11:54,363
a dramatic change
in our usual hours of daylight.

150
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:56,165
Meanwhile,
government officials,

151
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:59,268
as well as the heads of
the energy companies involved,

152
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,804
say the recent extensive
polar fracking

153
00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:05,374
has had no discernible
consequences whatsoever.

154
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:07,643
Here's what
the energy secretary had to say

155
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:10,145
in this evening's
press conference.

156
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:13,483
Listen, these
alarmists are dangerous liars.

157
00:12:13,485 --> 00:12:15,318
Let's not believe something

158
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,621
just because one so-called
scientist says it's true.

159
00:12:18,623 --> 00:12:21,524
Polar fracking has created
fantastic jobs,

160
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:24,193
big profits and energy
for our great country.

161
00:12:24,195 --> 00:12:26,096
Let's not forget our priori...

162
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:29,332
What you think, Fern?

163
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:31,400
I don't know, Hank.

164
00:12:31,402 --> 00:12:34,403
Shouldn't it be
getting dark out?

165
00:12:42,247 --> 00:12:44,313
So,
you can see from this diagram

166
00:12:44,315 --> 00:12:48,184
that if the Earth is pulled
even slightly off its axis,

167
00:12:48,186 --> 00:12:50,253
the repercussions
could be extreme.

168
00:12:50,255 --> 00:12:52,355
Coming up
in the next segment...

169
00:12:53,525 --> 00:12:56,225
Holy shit, man, this is crazy.

170
00:12:56,227 --> 00:12:59,428
A change in the Earth's
rotation or its spin rate?

171
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,430
That'd be catastrophic,
for sure.

172
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:04,500
All the cycles of the biosphere
would be affected.

173
00:13:04,502 --> 00:13:07,336
The natural cycles of sunlight
would be disrupted,

174
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:09,305
plants wouldn't grow,
wind patterns would change,

175
00:13:09,307 --> 00:13:11,340
and tectonic activity...

176
00:13:11,342 --> 00:13:13,442
Forget about it.

177
00:13:13,444 --> 00:13:15,613
The polar caps shifting
would mean...

178
00:13:17,615 --> 00:13:19,482
I don't want to say.

179
00:13:19,484 --> 00:13:22,318
Total planetary destruction.

180
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,455
For real?

181
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:29,659
Shut up.

182
00:13:31,596 --> 00:13:34,196
Okay, time's up, girls.

183
00:13:34,198 --> 00:13:35,898
Way up.

184
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,135
Well, if it isn't Geronimo
on the girls' floor again.

185
00:13:40,137 --> 00:13:41,737
Do you want to be a girl,
Geronimo?

186
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:43,506
No.

187
00:13:43,508 --> 00:13:47,310
Well, then get back
to the boys' section... now.

188
00:13:47,312 --> 00:13:49,712
Dennis.

189
00:13:49,714 --> 00:13:53,549
Can you please escort Geronimo
back to the boys' section?

190
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:55,651
I'll deal with these girls.

191
00:13:55,653 --> 00:13:58,421
Let's go, Geronimo.
You know the drill.

192
00:13:58,423 --> 00:14:00,222
Let's go, you clowns.

193
00:14:00,224 --> 00:14:02,425
It's bedtime for bozos.

194
00:14:02,427 --> 00:14:05,128
You two ladies, too.
Let's go.

195
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:09,298
Secretary of Energy
Pillerton, however...

196
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,600
Thank you.

197
00:14:10,602 --> 00:14:12,234
...fully refutes
these speculations,

198
00:14:12,236 --> 00:14:14,405
insisting...

199
00:14:17,675 --> 00:14:19,609
See you, Bobby.

200
00:14:19,611 --> 00:14:21,544
- Excellent.
- You got it? Need a bag?

201
00:14:21,546 --> 00:14:22,778
- No, thanks.
- All right.

202
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,614
- Bye, Bobby.
- See you guys.

203
00:14:24,616 --> 00:14:26,582
Wow, it's still so light out.

204
00:14:26,584 --> 00:14:28,584
Okay. So...

205
00:14:45,336 --> 00:14:47,536
- Bilbo Baggins.
- Hey, Dean.

206
00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:49,805
- What's up, buddy?
- How's things?

207
00:14:49,807 --> 00:14:51,741
After-hours delivery, WU-PS.

208
00:14:51,743 --> 00:14:53,776
Check this out.

209
00:14:53,778 --> 00:14:56,746
Got some
<i>Weird News of the World.</i>

210
00:14:56,748 --> 00:15:00,282
The Earth off its axis.

211
00:15:00,284 --> 00:15:03,154
That's bad news.

212
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:10,294
This is for you right here,
for your collection.

213
00:15:11,295 --> 00:15:13,629
Oh, man. <i>Starlog.</i>

214
00:15:13,631 --> 00:15:15,464
<i>Eerie.</i>

215
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:18,534
<i>Creepy,</i> number 61.

216
00:15:18,536 --> 00:15:21,671
April 1974.

217
00:15:21,673 --> 00:15:24,807
That motherfucker's rare,
before you was born and shit.

218
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:27,543
Oh, man. Here, let me
give you some money.

219
00:15:27,545 --> 00:15:29,378
No, that's on me.

220
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,714
- Add it to your collection.
- Thanks, man.

221
00:15:31,716 --> 00:15:34,316
Just give me
your Herbie Hancock right here,

222
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:37,286
and I'll be on my way.

223
00:15:37,288 --> 00:15:38,854
They need to fix the AC.

224
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:41,590
You know, it's kind of hot
in this motherfucker, huh?

225
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:43,459
All right.

226
00:15:43,461 --> 00:15:44,860
Okay-dokay.

227
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:47,565
All right,
see you next week, Frodo.

228
00:15:50,702 --> 00:15:52,501
Hey, Dean.

229
00:15:52,503 --> 00:15:56,439
I was wondering
if you wouldn't mind just, uh,

230
00:15:56,441 --> 00:15:58,810
dropping a little wisdom
until the next delivery.

231
00:16:01,846 --> 00:16:04,215
The world is perfect.

232
00:16:06,751 --> 00:16:09,687
Appreciate the details.

233
00:16:18,496 --> 00:16:20,663
"The world is perfect.

234
00:16:20,665 --> 00:16:23,568
Appreciate the details."

235
00:16:29,307 --> 00:16:31,307
You guys shouldn't be here.

236
00:16:35,813 --> 00:16:37,682
Strange.

237
00:16:49,694 --> 00:16:52,497
Tasty porcinis.

238
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:56,501
Okay.

239
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:14,583
Mmm.

240
00:17:14,585 --> 00:17:15,751
Kitty!

241
00:17:15,753 --> 00:17:16,952
Good evening.

242
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:18,487
This is Posie Juarez.

243
00:17:18,489 --> 00:17:19,722
We interrupt this program

244
00:17:19,724 --> 00:17:23,826
for a Centerville 7 News
Special Report.

245
00:17:23,828 --> 00:17:26,729
People are saying their pets
have either just disappeared

246
00:17:26,731 --> 00:17:30,432
or are acting unusually
skittish and aggressive.

247
00:17:30,434 --> 00:17:32,434
Here's a report
from Harrisville.

248
00:17:32,436 --> 00:17:35,371
Look at this.

249
00:17:35,373 --> 00:17:40,376
I mean, I just couldn't find
my cat, Rainbow.

250
00:17:40,378 --> 00:17:42,378
And when I finally did
find her,

251
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,446
she was under the house.

252
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:46,515
She's never done that before.

253
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:48,517
She's not usually like that.

254
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:50,686
She's very gentle and...

255
00:17:50,688 --> 00:17:53,722
That's so strange.
Where are you guys?

256
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:57,793
...too, and she had
this wild look in her eye,

257
00:17:57,795 --> 00:18:00,763
and when I finally tried
to pull her out,

258
00:18:00,765 --> 00:18:04,900
she scratched me all to shreds,
like a wild animal.

259
00:18:04,902 --> 00:18:07,803
That's so creepy.
I knew...

260
00:18:07,805 --> 00:18:09,738
We're back?

261
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,607
Hello.

262
00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:15,477
Wow, that is strange, and it
seems to be happening all over.

263
00:18:15,479 --> 00:18:17,847
We'll have more reports
at 11:00.

264
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:19,748
But for now,
this is Posie Juarez

265
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,184
for Centerville 7 News.

266
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:22,651
Stay safe...

267
00:18:22,653 --> 00:18:24,587
and keep your eyes open.

268
00:18:24,589 --> 00:18:26,591
Rumsfeld.

269
00:18:28,726 --> 00:18:31,627
Rumsfeld. Here, boy.

270
00:18:31,629 --> 00:18:33,631
Where the hell are you?

271
00:18:38,703 --> 00:18:40,870
Goddamn dog.

272
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,843
Rumsfeld? You out here?

273
00:18:48,012 --> 00:18:49,511
Rumsfeld,
what you doing over there?

274
00:18:49,513 --> 00:18:50,746
Get your ass inside.

275
00:18:54,652 --> 00:18:56,819
Come on, stupid.

276
00:18:56,821 --> 00:18:58,789
Hey.

277
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,024
What are you doing?

278
00:19:05,496 --> 00:19:07,565
Goddamn it.

279
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:12,568
Holy shit.

280
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,906
Who stole my fucking cows?

281
00:19:19,777 --> 00:19:22,413
Where the hell are my chickens?

282
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:31,553
Frank's cows.

283
00:19:31,555 --> 00:19:34,425
Into the woods, ladies.

284
00:19:35,493 --> 00:19:37,695
Welcome to my world.

285
00:19:46,271 --> 00:19:47,970
Damn it, Mallory.

286
00:19:47,972 --> 00:19:51,976
Even dead,
you reek of chardonnay.

287
00:19:55,546 --> 00:19:57,546
Cheap chardonnay.

288
00:20:00,518 --> 00:20:01,984
How's she looking?

289
00:20:01,986 --> 00:20:04,989
Well, she's not getting
any older.

290
00:20:07,091 --> 00:20:09,725
Wow.
The diner sure makes

291
00:20:09,727 --> 00:20:12,061
the world's best coffee,
doesn't it?

292
00:20:12,063 --> 00:20:14,697
Yeah, but how can you
drink it so late?

293
00:20:14,699 --> 00:20:17,733
- Won't it keep you up?
- No, I sleep like a baby.

294
00:20:17,735 --> 00:20:19,568
Except maybe when I know
there's a corpse

295
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:20,769
waiting for me at work.

296
00:20:20,771 --> 00:20:22,671
Oh, y-yeah.

297
00:20:22,673 --> 00:20:24,740
Cliff, is the coroner
from Latrobe

298
00:20:24,742 --> 00:20:26,108
gonna pick her up tomorrow?

299
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,577
It's getting a little creepy
being here alone

300
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:30,913
with Mallory decomposing
in there.

301
00:20:30,915 --> 00:20:33,782
Yeah, they're supposed to come
pick her up tomorrow morning.

302
00:20:33,784 --> 00:20:35,751
Thank God.

303
00:20:35,753 --> 00:20:38,154
I don't know why she can't be
over at the funeral home.

304
00:20:38,156 --> 00:20:42,791
'Cause she's going
to Potter's Field in Latrobe.

305
00:20:42,793 --> 00:20:45,761
And 'cause our new
unusual undertaker,

306
00:20:45,763 --> 00:20:49,031
Ms. Winston,
has got those two golfers

307
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:51,667
that were struck by lightning...
the Logans.

308
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:03,145
Thanks, Ronnie.

309
00:21:03,147 --> 00:21:04,913
It's not really necessary,
but...

310
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:07,016
Can I, uh,
drive you home, Mindy?

311
00:21:07,018 --> 00:21:10,586
Also not necessary, Ronnie.
You know I have my car here.

312
00:21:10,588 --> 00:21:11,920
Oh, yeah.

313
00:21:11,922 --> 00:21:14,790
- How is the Prius running?
- Fine.

314
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:17,593
Can you even fit two people in
that little Smart car of yours?

315
00:21:17,595 --> 00:21:20,896
Well, yeah.
Holds two nicely.

316
00:21:20,898 --> 00:21:24,099
This daylight thing
is bothering me.

317
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:26,202
It's strange.

318
00:21:26,204 --> 00:21:27,970
Well, what can I say?

319
00:21:27,972 --> 00:21:29,872
The world is
kind of strange lately.

320
00:21:29,874 --> 00:21:32,074
Yeah, it sure is.

321
00:21:32,076 --> 00:21:34,912
If you ask me, this whole thing
is gonna end badly.

322
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:40,749
So, what exactly do you mean,
Ronnie?

323
00:21:40,751 --> 00:21:43,052
Oh, uh, don't know.

324
00:21:43,054 --> 00:21:45,020
Just a feeling, I guess.

325
00:21:45,022 --> 00:21:46,722
Strong feeling.

326
00:21:46,724 --> 00:21:48,791
Oh, boy.

327
00:21:48,793 --> 00:21:51,727
You okay doing the whole
night shift alone, Cliff?

328
00:21:51,729 --> 00:21:53,662
Yeah, I can take a nap.

329
00:21:53,664 --> 00:21:56,098
I mean, I can just lie down
in that other cell

330
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,767
next to old Mallory.

331
00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:00,102
Oh, God.

332
00:22:00,104 --> 00:22:03,007
Next to her... her dead body?

333
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:07,945
Might bring back
some old memories.

334
00:22:10,147 --> 00:22:12,147
See you guys tomorrow.

335
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:14,819
- See you, Cliff.
- Yeah, see you tomorrow, Chief.

336
00:22:20,858 --> 00:22:24,160
"This is all gonna end badly."

337
00:22:24,162 --> 00:22:26,864
What does that mean?

338
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:32,134
I knew Mallory O'Brien
since I was a kid.

339
00:22:32,136 --> 00:22:34,437
And believe it or not,

340
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:36,772
sh-she was
a pretty young thing, too.

341
00:22:36,774 --> 00:22:39,875
Please.

342
00:22:39,877 --> 00:22:43,279
Sorry, but good riddance
to that drunken old goat.

343
00:22:43,281 --> 00:22:45,881
Well, I-I-I don't know, Fern.

344
00:22:45,883 --> 00:22:48,884
Geez, I got to get up
out of here.

345
00:22:48,886 --> 00:22:51,454
I-I got to, uh, get
to the hardware store

346
00:22:51,456 --> 00:22:54,123
early tomorrow morning.

347
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:56,859
I'm looking forward
to seeing you ladies tomorrow.

348
00:22:56,861 --> 00:22:58,194
- Mm.
- Take care, Hank.

349
00:22:58,196 --> 00:23:00,196
Good night, Hank. Sweet dreams.

350
00:23:00,198 --> 00:23:03,031
Hank is such a gentleman.

351
00:23:03,033 --> 00:23:05,201
Sure is.

352
00:23:05,203 --> 00:23:09,805
Well, I better
get started cleaning here.

353
00:23:09,807 --> 00:23:11,707
Listen, Lily.

354
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:13,942
I've been dying to ask you
about that new foreign woman

355
00:23:13,944 --> 00:23:15,777
that took over
the funeral home.

356
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:17,112
What's her name?

357
00:23:17,114 --> 00:23:18,914
Her name is Zelda Winston.

358
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:20,916
And she's strange, for sure.

359
00:23:20,918 --> 00:23:23,051
And she's got these, like,
really weird eyes,

360
00:23:23,053 --> 00:23:25,787
like she's, like,
looking right through you.

361
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:27,223
She pays me really well,
though.

362
00:23:27,225 --> 00:23:29,992
Zelda. What-what kind
of name is that?

363
00:23:29,994 --> 00:23:31,727
I don't know.

364
00:23:31,729 --> 00:23:33,962
She's probably, like, Irish
or Scottish or whatever.

365
00:23:33,964 --> 00:23:35,731
And she talks
really funny, though,

366
00:23:35,733 --> 00:23:37,132
so I don't always get it right.

367
00:23:37,134 --> 00:23:39,269
But I like the name Zelda.

368
00:23:39,271 --> 00:23:43,073
It reminds me of, um,
Zelda Fitzgerald.

369
00:23:44,108 --> 00:23:45,807
Who's that?

370
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:48,777
That's Great Gatsby's wife.

371
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:51,181
And who's that?

372
00:23:51,183 --> 00:23:53,949
That's the really rich guy
from the 1920s.

373
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:55,719
The Robert Redford guy.

374
00:23:57,087 --> 00:23:59,189
Well, anyway,
so what's it like over there

375
00:23:59,191 --> 00:24:01,823
in those secret rooms
since she took over?

376
00:24:01,825 --> 00:24:05,794
Well, there's these, like,
really creepy back rooms,

377
00:24:05,796 --> 00:24:08,030
you know, where they, like,
keep all the stiffs.

378
00:24:08,032 --> 00:24:12,067
And then next to that,
there's this big golden Buddha.

379
00:24:12,069 --> 00:24:13,269
A what, now?

380
00:24:13,271 --> 00:24:15,238
There's a big, shiny,
golden Buddha.

381
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,972
And then there's these, like,

382
00:24:16,974 --> 00:24:20,075
old-looking samurai swords
on a rack.

383
00:24:21,546 --> 00:24:23,346
Really?

384
00:26:05,483 --> 00:26:07,851
<i>Amituofo.</i>

385
00:26:18,896 --> 00:26:20,998
That's peculiar.

386
00:26:33,043 --> 00:26:35,846
Now, stay put, will you?

387
00:27:23,026 --> 00:27:26,262
What is it, Liv?

388
00:27:26,264 --> 00:27:28,398
You okay?

389
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,098
Yeah.

390
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,435
I guess so.

391
00:27:32,437 --> 00:27:36,004
I just got this creepy feeling.

392
00:27:36,006 --> 00:27:39,175
You were probably just
having a bad dream.

393
00:27:39,177 --> 00:27:41,444
Yeah, guess so.

394
00:27:41,446 --> 00:27:44,213
A bad dream.

395
00:27:44,215 --> 00:27:47,117
It's okay.
Just go back to sleep.

396
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:51,054
Thanks, Stell.

397
00:28:15,346 --> 00:28:17,078
Hmm.

398
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,216
Toxic lunar vibrations.

399
00:29:23,348 --> 00:29:26,282
All right, honey, I'm done.

400
00:29:26,284 --> 00:29:28,386
I'm leaving your money here.

401
00:29:30,555 --> 00:29:32,355
I'm out of here, Lil.

402
00:29:32,357 --> 00:29:33,689
Okay, Fern.
See you tomorrow.

403
00:29:33,691 --> 00:29:36,158
Not if I see you first.

404
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,293
Very funny.

405
00:29:37,295 --> 00:29:39,295
Excuse me, we're closed.

406
00:29:39,297 --> 00:29:41,297
What... what happened to you?

407
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:43,566
Aah! Lily!

408
00:29:49,106 --> 00:29:51,707
Oh, get the fuck away from me,

409
00:29:51,709 --> 00:29:54,176
you little motherfucker!
Oh, I'll fucking kill you!

410
00:29:54,178 --> 00:29:55,378
I'll shove this mop up
your fucking ass, motherfucker!

411
00:29:57,248 --> 00:29:59,315
Get the fuck away from me!

412
00:30:31,148 --> 00:30:32,517
Coffee.

413
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,696
Coffee.

414
00:30:48,433 --> 00:30:50,266
Coffee.

415
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,740
Centerville Police Department.

416
00:32:04,742 --> 00:32:07,677
This is Chief Robertson.

417
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,479
Hi, Hank. What's up?

418
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:12,617
Is it really 6:30?

419
00:32:17,588 --> 00:32:19,323
What?

420
00:32:21,325 --> 00:32:23,327
At the diner?

421
00:32:42,346 --> 00:32:45,481
Uh, like I said
on the phone, Cliff,

422
00:32:45,483 --> 00:32:49,585
often, Fern gets here early,
and so I thought I might

423
00:32:49,587 --> 00:32:52,755
get some coffee to go,
and-and then this.

424
00:32:52,757 --> 00:32:54,857
Oh, my God.

425
00:32:54,859 --> 00:32:57,293
I-I saw them.

426
00:32:57,295 --> 00:32:59,297
Fern and Lily.

427
00:33:06,571 --> 00:33:08,639
Oh, man.

428
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,900
Uh, wh-what the hell was it?

429
00:33:37,902 --> 00:33:41,537
A wild animal?
Uh, several wild animals?

430
00:33:41,539 --> 00:33:44,340
I don't know.

431
00:33:44,342 --> 00:33:48,511
But whatever it was,
it even smashed the coffeepots.

432
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,415
Oh, yuck.

433
00:34:37,428 --> 00:34:39,931
Jesus Christ, Cliff.

434
00:34:42,466 --> 00:34:45,601
What the heck was it,
a wild animal?

435
00:34:45,603 --> 00:34:47,603
Several wild animals?

436
00:34:47,605 --> 00:34:49,638
That's exactly what I said.

437
00:35:08,526 --> 00:35:10,793
Hey, guys.

438
00:35:10,795 --> 00:35:14,697
Wow. Fern's really done wonders
with these flower beds.

439
00:35:14,699 --> 00:35:16,901
Really perks up the place, huh?

440
00:35:20,638 --> 00:35:22,705
What?

441
00:35:22,707 --> 00:35:25,441
- What happened?
- God, Mindy.

442
00:35:25,443 --> 00:35:27,778
I don't think
you want to see this.

443
00:35:52,803 --> 00:35:55,907
Uh, no, no, I didn't need
to see that.

444
00:35:58,743 --> 00:36:00,643
Was it a wild animal?

445
00:36:00,645 --> 00:36:03,648
Or several wild animals?

446
00:36:05,816 --> 00:36:08,817
Cliff, is that really
Fern and Lily in there?

447
00:36:08,819 --> 00:36:10,819
Uh, no.

448
00:36:10,821 --> 00:36:15,559
That was Fern and Lily,
but now...

449
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,800
Do you need me here?

450
00:36:24,802 --> 00:36:27,605
Maybe you could help out
with crowd control.

451
00:36:29,874 --> 00:36:32,875
Okay, folks, can you move it
along now, please?

452
00:36:32,877 --> 00:36:34,843
Thank you.

453
00:36:34,845 --> 00:36:36,979
I can't believe it.

454
00:36:49,593 --> 00:36:52,594
God, Ronnie.
This is really awful.

455
00:36:52,596 --> 00:36:54,997
Maybe the worst thing
I've ever seen.

456
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:58,600
Yeah. Sure is.

457
00:36:58,602 --> 00:37:01,804
I...

458
00:37:01,806 --> 00:37:03,939
I-I got to go.

459
00:37:21,859 --> 00:37:23,659
So, what are you thinking?

460
00:37:26,564 --> 00:37:29,798
You... you really want to know?

461
00:37:31,836 --> 00:37:33,836
I'm thinking zombies.

462
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:35,738
What?

463
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,673
You know, zombies.

464
00:37:37,675 --> 00:37:40,778
Ghouls. The undead.

465
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,681
Are you...

466
00:37:45,683 --> 00:37:47,685
you're trying to tell me...

467
00:37:49,754 --> 00:37:51,889
...you're thinking
zombies did this?

468
00:37:53,891 --> 00:37:56,792
Yup.

469
00:38:17,882 --> 00:38:19,882
Hey, Jack,
will you check your phone

470
00:38:19,884 --> 00:38:22,853
- and see where we are exactly?
- Yeah.

471
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,092
Oh, man.

472
00:38:30,094 --> 00:38:32,730
I'm not getting
any reception out here.

473
00:38:34,732 --> 00:38:36,865
Geez, I don't even know
if my phone's working,

474
00:38:36,867 --> 00:38:38,669
- for some reason.
- Hmm.

475
00:38:40,405 --> 00:38:43,005
Let me try the radio.

476
00:38:46,911 --> 00:38:48,911
Oh, wow,
it's working again, so...

477
00:38:48,913 --> 00:38:50,846
I mean,
they're absolutely wrong.

478
00:38:50,848 --> 00:38:52,648
We know very well
that polar fracking

479
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:53,982
has been great
for this country.

480
00:38:53,984 --> 00:38:55,984
In my opinion, these naysayers

481
00:38:55,986 --> 00:38:57,686
should just move
to somewhere else

482
00:38:57,688 --> 00:38:59,855
- where they don't have to...
- I'm not listening to this.

See you, Bobby.

508
00:40:31,815 --> 00:40:34,952
- Stay sick, guys.
- Turn blue, Bobby.

509
00:40:36,754 --> 00:40:38,154
Hey, kids, how's it going?

510
00:40:38,156 --> 00:40:39,990
Eat me.

511
00:40:53,938 --> 00:40:56,772
Whoa, this place is a trip.

512
00:40:56,774 --> 00:40:58,243
Sure is.

513
00:40:59,043 --> 00:41:01,211
Oh. Hi.

514
00:41:01,213 --> 00:41:02,545
Hi.

515
00:41:02,547 --> 00:41:04,380
Nice shirt.

516
00:41:04,382 --> 00:41:07,082
- <i>Nosferatu.</i>
- Yeah.

517
00:41:07,084 --> 00:41:09,985
It's really cool.

518
00:41:09,987 --> 00:41:12,821
Thanks. I make 'em.

519
00:41:12,823 --> 00:41:15,291
How about that?
Earth off its axis.

520
00:41:15,293 --> 00:41:18,163
- End of the world.
- Mm.

521
00:41:20,198 --> 00:41:22,030
Flesh-eating zombies.

522
00:41:22,032 --> 00:41:24,200
You get a lot of zombies
around here?

523
00:41:24,202 --> 00:41:27,004
That depends, I guess.

524
00:41:28,273 --> 00:41:31,241
Uh, so... so, about the gas.

525
00:41:31,243 --> 00:41:34,876
You want to pay cash or credit?

526
00:41:34,878 --> 00:41:37,280
Here you go, Frodo.

527
00:41:37,282 --> 00:41:40,816
Cool. Thanks.

528
00:41:40,818 --> 00:41:45,154
Uh, did you, uh...

529
00:41:45,156 --> 00:41:47,290
Did you just call me Frodo?

530
00:41:47,292 --> 00:41:48,591
Did I?

531
00:41:48,593 --> 00:41:50,892
Hey, is there a motel in town?

532
00:41:50,894 --> 00:41:52,161
Yeah, there is one

533
00:41:52,163 --> 00:41:53,862
- just down the...
- Ooh.

534
00:41:53,864 --> 00:41:55,331
Oh, that's a really good CD.

535
00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:58,066
Sturgill Simpson,
"The Dead Don't Die."

536
00:41:58,068 --> 00:42:00,035
Yeah, I know.
I love this song.

537
00:42:00,037 --> 00:42:02,137
Is it nice?

538
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:04,274
- What?
- The motel.

539
00:42:04,276 --> 00:42:06,875
Oh, yeah.
It's, uh... it's kind of cool.

540
00:42:06,877 --> 00:42:08,311
It's one of those
old-school ones.

541
00:42:08,313 --> 00:42:10,313
Like in old-school
horror movies,

542
00:42:10,315 --> 00:42:14,883
with, like... like in <i>Psycho</i>
with the separated bungalows?

543
00:42:14,885 --> 00:42:17,085
Uh, the Bates Motel in <i>Psycho</i>

544
00:42:17,087 --> 00:42:20,325
was not separated into
"little bungalows."

545
00:42:22,092 --> 00:42:25,060
- Ooh.
- All right.

546
00:42:25,062 --> 00:42:29,432
That's 12 for the CD
and two dollars for the soda.

547
00:42:29,434 --> 00:42:31,634
- Here you go. You can just keep the change.
- Thanks.

548
00:42:31,636 --> 00:42:33,369
Oh, cool.

549
00:42:33,371 --> 00:42:36,006
Whoa.

550
00:42:41,212 --> 00:42:44,347
That's a super cool ride,
by the way.

551
00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:46,982
Very, uh, George Romero.

552
00:42:46,984 --> 00:42:48,351
Yeah, it's a classic.

553
00:42:48,353 --> 00:42:51,220
Your film knowledge
is impressive.

554
00:42:51,222 --> 00:42:52,988
What's your name?

555
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:54,357
Bobby.

556
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:56,259
Bobby Wiggins.

557
00:42:56,261 --> 00:42:59,061
What's that?
Bobby Baggins?

558
00:42:59,063 --> 00:43:01,464
No, Wiggins.

559
00:43:01,466 --> 00:43:03,366
I'm Zoe.

560
00:43:03,368 --> 00:43:04,966
Thanks, Bobby.

561
00:43:58,021 --> 00:43:59,555
Will the Feds be
brought in on this?

562
00:43:59,557 --> 00:44:02,427
It's... it's really weird.

563
00:44:05,196 --> 00:44:07,363
I see.

564
00:44:07,365 --> 00:44:09,399
But Miss O'Brien...

565
00:44:09,401 --> 00:44:12,069
so she has to stay with us
another night?

566
00:44:14,406 --> 00:44:17,005
Oh, God.

567
00:44:17,007 --> 00:44:19,444
Okay. Thank you.

568
00:44:22,012 --> 00:44:23,279
Hello, Ms. Winston.

569
00:44:23,281 --> 00:44:25,415
Hello,
Officer Minerva Morrison.

570
00:44:25,417 --> 00:44:27,316
Do call me Zelda.

571
00:44:27,318 --> 00:44:30,018
Yeah, okay, sure.

572
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,020
You've been informed
of the tragedy?

573
00:44:32,022 --> 00:44:33,189
I have.

574
00:44:33,191 --> 00:44:35,056
Am I to understand
that the remains

575
00:44:35,058 --> 00:44:37,226
will be brought to
The Ever After Funeral Home

576
00:44:37,228 --> 00:44:38,494
for my preparations?

577
00:44:38,496 --> 00:44:40,196
Uh, no,
that won't be necessary.

578
00:44:40,198 --> 00:44:42,265
The Feds have already
collected the remains.

579
00:44:42,267 --> 00:44:44,167
They've brought them
out of the county.

580
00:44:44,169 --> 00:44:46,171
I see.

581
00:44:54,412 --> 00:44:56,412
Is there anything else
I can do?

582
00:44:56,414 --> 00:44:58,079
Yes.

583
00:44:58,081 --> 00:44:59,615
I do have
an unrelated question.

584
00:44:59,617 --> 00:45:02,485
- Shoot.
- "Shoot"?

585
00:45:02,487 --> 00:45:04,387
I mean ask me.

586
00:45:04,389 --> 00:45:06,222
Oh, yes.

587
00:45:06,224 --> 00:45:08,491
Are you, by any chance,
a couple?

588
00:45:08,493 --> 00:45:10,493
You and the physically
attractive one?

589
00:45:10,495 --> 00:45:13,529
Um, you mean the younger one?

590
00:45:13,531 --> 00:45:15,231
Officer Peterson?

591
00:45:15,233 --> 00:45:18,369
That's the one I mean...
Officer Ronald Peterson.

592
00:45:20,371 --> 00:45:23,406
Well, actually, no.

593
00:45:23,408 --> 00:45:26,141
Why do you ask, Zelda?

594
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:29,245
Just accumulating
local information.

595
00:45:29,247 --> 00:45:31,247
Oh.

596
00:45:31,249 --> 00:45:33,218
Okay.

597
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:43,392
Dear Jesus.

598
00:45:43,394 --> 00:45:45,428
I mean, that's
absolutely horrible.

599
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:47,430
I mean, who or what is-is-is

600
00:45:47,432 --> 00:45:50,098
per-perpetrating
these... these...

601
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,334
Hey.

602
00:45:51,336 --> 00:45:54,270
- What's going on?
- Hey.

603
00:45:54,272 --> 00:45:56,272
Nice car.

604
00:45:56,274 --> 00:45:58,307
'68 Pontiac LeMans.

605
00:45:58,309 --> 00:46:00,243
Yeah. It's a beauty, huh?

606
00:46:00,245 --> 00:46:02,378
It's our friend's
totally rad ride.

607
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:05,348
It's a classic.

608
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:07,250
Have a good one.

609
00:46:07,252 --> 00:46:08,417
Later.

610
00:46:08,419 --> 00:46:09,852
Guys, I'm so hungry.

611
00:46:09,854 --> 00:46:11,587
Same. Let's eat.

612
00:46:11,589 --> 00:46:13,591
I'll ask. H-Hey.

613
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:17,293
- Nice car.
- Thank you.

614
00:46:17,295 --> 00:46:19,662
Uh, do you guys know if there's
a diner or restaurant nearby?

615
00:46:19,664 --> 00:46:20,663
Sorry.

616
00:46:20,665 --> 00:46:25,301
The only diner in town
is closed, indefinitely.

617
00:46:25,303 --> 00:46:26,569
Well, that's unfortunate.

618
00:46:26,571 --> 00:46:29,572
Uh, but we, uh, have
several vending machines

619
00:46:29,574 --> 00:46:32,575
containing snacks, uh,
right over by the office.

620
00:46:32,577 --> 00:46:34,142
Okay. Thanks.

621
00:46:34,144 --> 00:46:35,311
Do you have change
for three dollars?

622
00:46:35,313 --> 00:46:37,315
Yeah, I do.

623
00:46:47,325 --> 00:46:49,625
I like your badge.

624
00:46:49,627 --> 00:46:53,462
Oh, th... thank you.

625
00:46:53,464 --> 00:46:55,565
That's, uh...

626
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:00,703
- That-that should be good.
- Oh, okay.

627
00:47:00,705 --> 00:47:02,238
- Thanks.
- Oh, no, no.

628
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,606
- You can, you can have it.
- Yeah?

629
00:47:03,608 --> 00:47:06,210
Okay. Thanks.

630
00:47:07,278 --> 00:47:09,478
They just checked in.

631
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,315
Hipsters from the big city.

632
00:47:12,317 --> 00:47:14,617
- Yeah?
- Yep.

633
00:47:14,619 --> 00:47:17,386
My educated guess
would be Pittsburgh.

634
00:47:17,388 --> 00:47:19,689
They got that urban style,
you know.

635
00:47:19,691 --> 00:47:22,258
Oh, well, those plates
are from Ohio,

636
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,927
so my educated guess
would be Cleveland.

637
00:47:24,929 --> 00:47:28,633
Oh. Cleveland. Hmm.

638
00:47:30,501 --> 00:47:33,469
Yeah, Cleveland.

639
00:47:33,471 --> 00:47:34,704
Thanks.

640
00:47:34,706 --> 00:47:36,407
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

641
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:40,576
That girl's part Mexican.

642
00:47:40,578 --> 00:47:42,345
- Hmm?
- Really?

643
00:47:42,347 --> 00:47:43,746
How can you tell?

644
00:47:43,748 --> 00:47:45,581
I have an affinity
for Mexicans.

645
00:47:45,583 --> 00:47:47,450
They're, like,
my favorite people.

646
00:47:47,452 --> 00:47:51,320
I love Mexico.
I've been down there twice.

647
00:47:51,322 --> 00:47:52,588
Okay, Ronnie,

648
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:54,724
then you should be the one
to inform them

649
00:47:54,726 --> 00:47:57,560
that if they're gonna spend
the night in Centerville,

650
00:47:57,562 --> 00:48:01,530
to not go out and to keep
their hotel room door locked.

651
00:48:01,532 --> 00:48:03,267
Okay?

652
00:48:09,474 --> 00:48:13,643
Uh, you know, Cliff, uh...

653
00:48:13,645 --> 00:48:16,646
I know this isn't important
comparatively, uh,

654
00:48:16,648 --> 00:48:19,382
but, uh, all of my cats are gone.

655
00:48:19,384 --> 00:48:22,451
And-and, normally, they-they,
uh, just stay inside.

656
00:48:24,689 --> 00:48:26,455
Well, I'm sorry
about that, Danny.

657
00:48:26,457 --> 00:48:28,224
They could be hiding.

658
00:48:29,827 --> 00:48:32,762
Nothing is happening normally
right now.

659
00:48:32,764 --> 00:48:35,498
- Yeah.
- How did they react?

660
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,701
They said, "I heard you had
a lot of zombies around here,"

661
00:48:38,703 --> 00:48:41,470
and then they laughed.

662
00:48:41,472 --> 00:48:46,308
Infernal hipsters
with their irony.

663
00:49:24,749 --> 00:49:26,751
Melville.

664
00:49:29,353 --> 00:49:33,355
"Nameless miseries
of the numberless mortals."

665
00:49:43,367 --> 00:49:47,403
Well, everything
looks normal out there.

666
00:49:47,405 --> 00:49:48,904
Yeah.

667
00:49:48,906 --> 00:49:52,341
But what happened
sounds like the start of

668
00:49:52,343 --> 00:49:54,710
- a gruesome horror film.
- Sure does.

669
00:49:54,712 --> 00:49:57,513
Boo!

670
00:49:57,515 --> 00:50:00,549
Really, really not funny,
Geronimo.

671
00:50:00,551 --> 00:50:03,652
You guys hear about those
grisly murders at the diner?

672
00:50:03,654 --> 00:50:06,422
Yeah.
Just talking about them.

673
00:50:06,424 --> 00:50:08,390
Creepy.

674
00:50:08,392 --> 00:50:09,825
I've been listening
to the radio,

675
00:50:09,827 --> 00:50:12,361
and I'm sure
it's the undead, yo.

676
00:50:12,363 --> 00:50:14,797
Reanimated by the Earth
being thrown off its axis

677
00:50:14,799 --> 00:50:16,732
from the polar fracking.

678
00:50:16,734 --> 00:50:18,567
What are you saying?

679
00:50:18,569 --> 00:50:20,569
I'm saying...

680
00:50:20,571 --> 00:50:23,806
full-on
zombie apocalypse, baby.

681
00:50:23,808 --> 00:50:25,808
Soon, there'll be
hordes of them.

682
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:28,410
- Geronimo.
- Shit.

683
00:50:28,412 --> 00:50:30,112
Do you want to lose
your privileges again?

684
00:50:30,114 --> 00:50:31,881
No, sir.

685
00:50:31,883 --> 00:50:33,818
Then let's go.

686
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:37,822
Unbelievable.

687
00:51:01,913 --> 00:51:04,580
Cliff,
why'd they used to separate

688
00:51:04,582 --> 00:51:06,582
the children's graves
from the adults'?

689
00:51:06,584 --> 00:51:07,817
Don't know.

690
00:51:07,819 --> 00:51:10,419
Some kind of
a 19th-century thing.

691
00:51:10,421 --> 00:51:12,454
Huh.

692
00:51:12,456 --> 00:51:15,524
Seems like a bad idea somehow.

693
00:51:15,526 --> 00:51:18,661
Yeah. So, what exactly are we
looking for here? Zombies?

694
00:51:32,476 --> 00:51:35,444
Hey, look over here.

695
00:51:35,446 --> 00:51:37,448
Here's another one.

696
00:51:41,752 --> 00:51:44,822
Oh, man.
This isn't gonna end well.

697
00:52:15,753 --> 00:52:17,887
Goddamn it.

698
00:52:17,889 --> 00:52:19,891
Ghouls.

699
00:52:22,793 --> 00:52:25,694
This is undead, reanimated,

700
00:52:25,696 --> 00:52:28,797
full-on,
flesh-eating zombie shit.

701
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:30,801
No question.

702
00:52:50,821 --> 00:52:52,823
I was supposed to retire.

703
00:52:54,959 --> 00:52:57,528
- Two years ago.
- I know.

704
00:52:58,963 --> 00:53:01,697
- Why didn't you?
- What?

705
00:53:01,699 --> 00:53:03,966
Retire two years ago.

706
00:53:03,968 --> 00:53:07,036
Are we improvising here?

707
00:53:07,038 --> 00:53:09,772
No, I was just asking.

708
00:53:09,774 --> 00:53:11,774
But I probably know
the answer anyway.

709
00:53:11,776 --> 00:53:14,645
Probably. Yeah.

710
00:53:18,582 --> 00:53:21,050
So, is our plan
to continue to inform people

711
00:53:21,052 --> 00:53:23,786
about the zombie danger
before it gets dark?

712
00:53:23,788 --> 00:53:26,055
Oh, God, Ronnie.

713
00:53:26,057 --> 00:53:28,857
Uh... I guess so.

714
00:53:28,859 --> 00:53:30,693
Because we passed
Farmer Miller's place

715
00:53:30,695 --> 00:53:32,995
a little while ago.
Do we need to inform him?

716
00:53:32,997 --> 00:53:35,798
Fuck Farmer Miller.

717
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,800
Really?

718
00:53:37,802 --> 00:53:40,604
He is a citizen of Centerville.

719
00:53:42,006 --> 00:53:44,075
You're right. Uh...

720
00:53:46,077 --> 00:53:48,077
We'll have Mindy call him.

721
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:50,081
Oh, okay.

722
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:02,158
So, Ronnie, how the fuck
do you kill a zombie?

723
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,562
Well, you got to kill the head.

724
00:54:05,896 --> 00:54:08,097
- "Kill the head."
- Yeah.

725
00:54:08,099 --> 00:54:12,768
By any means necessary,
kill the head.

726
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:14,872
Decapitate.
It's the only way to kill them.

727
00:54:16,874 --> 00:54:20,042
Jesus.

728
00:54:20,044 --> 00:54:25,914
And that's really the only way
to stop zombies,

729
00:54:25,916 --> 00:54:28,751
is to kill the head, Hank.

730
00:54:28,753 --> 00:54:34,190
I know it's gruesome,
but complete decapitation.

731
00:54:34,192 --> 00:54:38,894
Doesn't matter if you use
a-a machete, steel wire,

732
00:54:38,896 --> 00:54:41,030
hedge clippers, whatever.

733
00:54:41,032 --> 00:54:44,833
Just as long as the spinal cord
is severed, right?

734
00:54:44,835 --> 00:54:48,072
And the head... is cut off.

735
00:54:50,074 --> 00:54:53,142
And that's it.
De-animated.

736
00:54:53,144 --> 00:54:56,812
Only way to kill the dead:

737
00:54:56,814 --> 00:54:58,381
kill the head.

738
00:54:58,383 --> 00:55:00,082
Uh, wait, Bobby.

739
00:55:00,084 --> 00:55:03,788
I-I'm not so sure
it was zombies.

740
00:55:08,025 --> 00:55:12,127
You said they ate
Lily and Fern's flesh.

741
00:55:12,129 --> 00:55:15,030
Usually, they go for
the brains.

742
00:55:15,032 --> 00:55:17,933
It's unusual, but...

743
00:55:17,935 --> 00:55:20,702
it's still cannibals, man.

744
00:55:20,704 --> 00:55:22,137
Mm.

745
00:55:22,139 --> 00:55:24,773
Definitely zombies.

746
00:55:24,775 --> 00:55:26,176
Okay?

747
00:55:26,178 --> 00:55:28,844
Hank, you can trust me.

748
00:55:28,846 --> 00:55:32,182
I've seen almost every
zombie film ever made.

749
00:55:32,184 --> 00:55:34,016
Mm.

750
00:55:34,018 --> 00:55:37,119
This is zombie shit going down,
and we got to get prepared.

751
00:55:37,121 --> 00:55:39,021
I don't know
what to think anymore.

752
00:55:40,925 --> 00:55:43,025
Hank, the shells.

753
00:55:43,027 --> 00:55:45,029
Oh, yeah.

754
00:55:49,066 --> 00:55:52,101
Better safe than sorry.

755
00:55:52,103 --> 00:55:55,104
Yeah, you're right.

756
00:55:55,106 --> 00:55:57,808
Safe than sorry.

757
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:02,178
Just kill the head.

758
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,812
Several other shocking

759
00:56:03,814 --> 00:56:05,080
and brutal attacks

760
00:56:05,082 --> 00:56:07,082
occurred in this
residential neighborhood

761
00:56:07,084 --> 00:56:08,784
just outside East Brady.

762
00:56:08,786 --> 00:56:10,153
The images are just
too gruesome

763
00:56:10,155 --> 00:56:11,987
to broadcast at this time,

764
00:56:11,989 --> 00:56:14,823
and police are saying
that it almost looked like

765
00:56:14,825 --> 00:56:17,726
the victims were attacked
by a wild animal

766
00:56:17,728 --> 00:56:19,862
or perhaps
several wild animals.

767
00:56:23,235 --> 00:56:25,000
Police did provide this map

768
00:56:25,002 --> 00:56:26,902
showing where these...

769
00:56:26,904 --> 00:56:28,937
Goddamn it,
my watch doesn't fucking work.

770
00:56:28,939 --> 00:56:31,174
I just got it.
It's mad expensive.

771
00:56:31,176 --> 00:56:33,775
Holy shit, dude,
this is insane.

772
00:56:33,777 --> 00:56:35,144
Wow.

773
00:56:35,146 --> 00:56:37,846
Maybe that Harry Potter guy
at the gas station

774
00:56:37,848 --> 00:56:39,114
wasn't kidding, man.

775
00:56:39,116 --> 00:56:40,916
What, about-about what?

776
00:56:40,918 --> 00:56:42,252
About there being zombies
around here.

777
00:56:42,254 --> 00:56:43,986
That's not even funny.

778
00:56:43,988 --> 00:56:45,988
Don't joke.
It's really, really creepy.

779
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:47,990
Authorities are
warning all citizens

780
00:56:47,992 --> 00:56:50,160
to stay inside
and keep all doors

781
00:56:50,162 --> 00:56:52,094
and windows locked and secured.

782
00:56:52,096 --> 00:56:53,729
Zack, lock the door, will you?

783
00:56:53,731 --> 00:56:55,063
- Got you.
- But for now,

784
00:56:55,065 --> 00:56:57,267
this is Posie Juarez
for Centerville 7 News.

785
00:56:58,936 --> 00:57:01,739
Stay safe
and keep your eyes open.

786
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,868
Kitties!

787
00:58:07,205 --> 00:58:09,274
Where are you guys?

788
00:58:15,247 --> 00:58:17,047
Kitties!

789
00:58:21,152 --> 00:58:23,154
Kitties!

790
00:58:28,293 --> 00:58:31,893
What in the name of...

791
00:58:31,895 --> 00:58:33,396
Cats are gone.

792
00:58:33,398 --> 00:58:36,299
Haven't seen or heard a bird
in two days.

793
00:58:36,301 --> 00:58:38,201
It's already night out.

794
00:58:38,203 --> 00:58:41,103
It's 5:00.

795
00:58:41,105 --> 00:58:43,172
Dear Lord in Heaven, help us.

796
00:58:43,174 --> 00:58:45,140
Free cable.

797
00:58:45,142 --> 00:58:48,076
Oh, it's free ca...

798
00:58:59,023 --> 00:59:01,125
Thank God you guys are back.

799
00:59:03,395 --> 00:59:06,897
Jesus, Cliff, do we really need
all this stuff?

800
00:59:08,899 --> 00:59:10,366
What's all this for?

801
00:59:10,368 --> 00:59:12,468
We went by the hardware store.

802
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:15,204
You know what happens.

803
00:59:15,206 --> 00:59:18,241
Hank and that hobbit kid Bobby
from the gas station

804
00:59:18,243 --> 00:59:20,042
have locked themselves in
over there.

805
00:59:20,044 --> 00:59:23,111
They tried to convince
other citizens to join them,

806
00:59:23,113 --> 00:59:24,913
but with no success.

807
00:59:24,915 --> 00:59:26,249
Why? What's happening?

808
00:59:26,251 --> 00:59:28,153
Is it some sort
of epidemic or what?

809
00:59:29,987 --> 00:59:31,989
It's zombies.

810
00:59:33,957 --> 00:59:35,991
- What are you saying?
- Well, it's the undead.

811
00:59:35,993 --> 00:59:37,993
They've been reanimated.

812
00:59:37,995 --> 00:59:41,264
Caused by the Earth having been
pulled off its axis,

813
00:59:41,266 --> 00:59:42,998
caused by the polar fracking.

814
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,434
But the authorities
and energy people

815
00:59:44,436 --> 00:59:46,438
keep saying that's not true.

816
00:59:50,241 --> 00:59:52,210
Really?

817
00:59:57,981 --> 00:59:59,282
Oh, my God.

818
00:59:59,284 --> 01:00:01,083
- She's alive?
- No.

819
01:00:01,085 --> 01:00:04,119
She's not.
She's just undead.

820
01:00:04,121 --> 01:00:07,089
Chardonnay.

821
01:00:07,091 --> 01:00:10,426
Holy shit.
Did she just say "chardonnay"?

822
01:00:10,428 --> 01:00:13,229
Yeah, she did.

823
01:00:13,231 --> 01:00:15,164
Look out, kids.

824
01:00:15,166 --> 01:00:17,433
Hey, little Mallory.

825
01:00:22,106 --> 01:00:25,274
Chardonnay.

826
01:00:25,276 --> 01:00:27,210
I got this, Cliff.

827
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,166
Chardonnay.

828
01:00:53,505 --> 01:00:56,037
Those are some
pretty good cuts.

829
01:00:56,039 --> 01:00:58,307
You played some
minor league ball, didn't you?

830
01:00:58,309 --> 01:01:00,410
Well, um, a little Class A.

831
01:01:00,412 --> 01:01:02,414
It-it was a long time ago.

832
01:01:04,416 --> 01:01:07,550
Mindy, just remember
to kill the head.

833
01:01:07,552 --> 01:01:09,585
Okay.

834
01:01:09,587 --> 01:01:12,053
Kill the head. Okay.

835
01:01:12,055 --> 01:01:14,055
Ronnie, take this thing
out of here.

836
01:01:14,057 --> 01:01:16,059
You got it, Chief.

837
01:01:18,496 --> 01:01:21,164
Oh, that's very nice.

838
01:01:21,166 --> 01:01:23,466
Very nice, indeed.

839
01:01:23,468 --> 01:01:27,370
You look gorgeous.

840
01:01:27,372 --> 01:01:30,239
You two could have been
the king and queen

841
01:01:30,241 --> 01:01:32,410
of the golf club, so you could.

842
01:01:36,013 --> 01:01:37,482
Oh, my.

843
01:01:44,589 --> 01:01:46,957
What's this?

844
01:01:55,065 --> 01:01:57,633
Are you in this together?

845
01:01:57,635 --> 01:02:00,236
I mean, this is
really inappropriate.

846
01:02:00,238 --> 01:02:02,540
Oh, good grief.

847
01:02:06,377 --> 01:02:08,377
So, the dead just don't
want to die today.

848
01:02:08,379 --> 01:02:10,315
Is that it?

849
01:02:21,593 --> 01:02:24,059
That's a shame.

850
01:02:24,061 --> 01:02:26,364
I had them looking so bonny.

851
01:02:28,266 --> 01:02:31,101
Oh, what is it now?

852
01:02:34,606 --> 01:02:37,609
Who's there?

853
01:02:47,852 --> 01:02:49,621
Shit.

854
01:02:59,597 --> 01:03:01,297
Who the fuck are you,

855
01:03:01,299 --> 01:03:02,865
and what do you want?

856
01:03:02,867 --> 01:03:04,534
Ow! Hey!

857
01:03:04,536 --> 01:03:06,369
Get the fuck...

858
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:21,384
Shit.

859
01:03:21,386 --> 01:03:23,152
I killed him.

860
01:03:23,154 --> 01:03:24,587
That was weird.

861
01:03:24,589 --> 01:03:26,391
Candy.

862
01:03:27,725 --> 01:03:30,626
- Candy.
- Snapple.

863
01:03:30,628 --> 01:03:32,628
Snapple.

864
01:03:39,504 --> 01:03:41,506
Snickers.

865
01:03:44,409 --> 01:03:48,177
- Popsicle.
- Snickers.

866
01:03:48,179 --> 01:03:50,214
Popsicle.

867
01:03:51,583 --> 01:03:53,685
Popsicle.

868
01:04:03,695 --> 01:04:06,129
Toys.

869
01:04:07,932 --> 01:04:10,133
Skittles.

870
01:04:11,502 --> 01:04:13,504
Toys.

871
01:04:23,781 --> 01:04:25,948
Wi-Fi.

872
01:04:27,685 --> 01:04:29,652
Wi-Fi.

873
01:04:29,654 --> 01:04:31,556
Bluetooth.

874
01:04:33,491 --> 01:04:36,126
Bluetooth.

875
01:04:38,363 --> 01:04:40,264
Siri.

876
01:04:41,499 --> 01:04:44,268

877
01:04:45,536 --> 01:04:48,270

Oxy.

880
01:04:55,413 --> 01:04:57,415
Guitar.

881
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:01,651
Guitar.

882
01:05:01,653 --> 01:05:05,454
- Tools.
- Drill.

883
01:05:05,456 --> 01:05:07,423
Sander.

884
01:05:07,425 --> 01:05:09,291
Tools.

885
01:05:10,762 --> 01:05:12,762
- Hey, no. Come on.
- Hey. Hey.

886
01:05:12,764 --> 01:05:14,697
Okay, okay. Holy shit.

887
01:05:14,699 --> 01:05:16,766
- Hey, we need to mow them down.
- Come on, man.

888
01:05:16,768 --> 01:05:18,336
Bobby. Shit.

889
01:05:28,246 --> 01:05:29,580
I got this one, Hank.

890
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:37,453
Shit.

891
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:44,627
Hey, Bobby!

892
01:05:44,629 --> 01:05:46,028
The head, Hank!

893
01:05:52,403 --> 01:05:54,670
I killed the head.

894
01:06:05,483 --> 01:06:07,516
What the fuck?
Is this for real?

895
01:06:07,518 --> 01:06:10,319
- Shh, shh! Shh, shh, shh.
- Quiet!

896
01:06:11,589 --> 01:06:13,422
Get the fuck off me!

897
01:06:16,427 --> 01:06:18,828
- Fuck!
- Holy shit!

898
01:06:18,830 --> 01:06:20,663
Shithead!

899
01:06:22,734 --> 01:06:24,366
Save me!

900
01:06:24,368 --> 01:06:26,769
- What? No!
- What are you doing? Stop!

901
01:06:26,771 --> 01:06:28,738
Get the fuck off me!

902
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:30,508
Closet.

903
01:06:35,847 --> 01:06:37,847
- Fuck!
- Fucking shithead!

904
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:46,722
...violent...

905
01:06:46,724 --> 01:06:48,524
Reports of these

906
01:06:48,526 --> 01:06:50,092
bizarre attacks are escalating,

907
01:06:50,094 --> 01:06:52,828
with incidents occurring
sporadically across the country

908
01:06:52,830 --> 01:06:56,665
and, as we're now learning,
uh, across the globe.

909
01:06:56,667 --> 01:06:58,501
You see,
these violent marauders

910
01:06:58,503 --> 01:07:01,771
have apparently first
been gathering in cemeteries,

911
01:07:01,773 --> 01:07:05,474
then dispersing
into towns and suburbs,

912
01:07:05,476 --> 01:07:07,576
while other reports suggest...

913
01:07:12,817 --> 01:07:15,286
Great.

914
01:07:17,421 --> 01:07:19,822
Now even the radio's dead.

915
01:07:19,824 --> 01:07:21,824
Good riddance.

916
01:07:23,928 --> 01:07:26,462
Guys...

917
01:07:26,464 --> 01:07:28,564
shouldn't we be
telling each other

918
01:07:28,566 --> 01:07:31,567
that it's all gonna be okay?

919
01:07:31,569 --> 01:07:35,306
That this will all go away,
like a bad dream?

920
01:07:38,442 --> 01:07:40,576
Ronnie?

921
01:07:40,578 --> 01:07:44,749
Gee, Mindy,
I'm not sure I can say that.

922
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:52,155
Cliff?

923
01:07:52,157 --> 01:07:54,623
Please?

924
01:07:54,625 --> 01:07:58,161
It's all gonna be okay, Mindy.

925
01:07:58,163 --> 01:08:02,633
Maybe it'll all just go away,
like a bad dream.

926
01:08:06,537 --> 01:08:08,539
I doubt it.

927
01:08:26,824 --> 01:08:28,524
Seven and eight.

928
01:08:28,526 --> 01:08:30,526
Now do both for eight.

929
01:08:30,528 --> 01:08:33,664
And push. And push. Yeah.

930
01:08:44,976 --> 01:08:46,742
Cleveland.

931
01:08:59,624 --> 01:09:00,925
What the...

932
01:09:06,231 --> 01:09:09,800
Now, that's what I call
a murder of crows.

933
01:09:31,689 --> 01:09:34,690
Darn, she's really good
with that thing, isn't she?

934
01:09:34,692 --> 01:09:36,694
She sure is.

935
01:09:41,966 --> 01:09:43,866
She's strange.

936
01:09:43,868 --> 01:09:46,969
- She's Scottish.
- She's Scottish?

937
01:10:01,919 --> 01:10:04,755
Let's unbolt the door
and get her in here.

938
01:10:09,294 --> 01:10:12,861
Thank you very much,
Officer Ronald Peterson.

939
01:10:12,863 --> 01:10:15,731
Chief Clifford Robertson.

940
01:10:15,733 --> 01:10:17,300
Officer Minerva Morrison.

941
01:10:17,302 --> 01:10:20,703
What exactly is
your plan of action,

942
01:10:20,705 --> 01:10:22,004
Chief Clifford Robertson?

943
01:10:22,006 --> 01:10:24,740
Well... well...

944
01:10:24,742 --> 01:10:26,976
uh, it's a little
quieter now.

945
01:10:26,978 --> 01:10:30,980
I-I think, I guess we should
just get in the patrol car...

946
01:10:30,982 --> 01:10:34,317
some of us, anyway...
and, uh, patrol the community.

947
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:35,918
After all, that is our job.

948
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,619
I'm not staying here.

949
01:10:37,621 --> 01:10:39,888
I-I think we should all
go together.

950
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:42,860
Well, I guess you're right.

951
01:10:45,062 --> 01:10:47,029
I could stay here
and monitor things,

952
01:10:47,031 --> 01:10:49,031
if that would help.

953
01:10:49,033 --> 01:10:50,833
I'm quite confident
of my ability

954
01:10:50,835 --> 01:10:53,135
to defend myself
against the undead.

955
01:10:53,137 --> 01:10:56,007
Well, I-I can see that.

956
01:10:58,642 --> 01:11:03,014
But, uh, can you operate the
police radio and our computer?

957
01:11:05,616 --> 01:11:07,750
Oh, aye.

958
01:11:07,752 --> 01:11:09,152
No bother.

959
01:11:09,154 --> 01:11:10,719
Certainly.

960
01:11:10,721 --> 01:11:12,087
Yeah, if it still works.

961
01:11:12,089 --> 01:11:13,922
I don't know.

962
01:11:13,924 --> 01:11:18,093
That would be a little unusual,
wouldn't it, Cliff?

963
01:11:18,095 --> 01:11:20,129
Well, this is
a highly unusual situation

964
01:11:20,131 --> 01:11:23,932
we're in, is it not,
Chief Clifford Robertson?

965
01:11:23,934 --> 01:11:27,669
Perhaps we could all
meet up again in a wee while

966
01:11:27,671 --> 01:11:30,005
in the cemetery.

967
01:11:34,011 --> 01:11:36,111
Yeah, it's okay.
I guess it's okay.

968
01:11:36,113 --> 01:11:37,880
Uh, let's go, guys.

969
01:11:37,882 --> 01:11:39,748
We've got some more weapons
in the patrol car.

970
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:41,917
Excuse me,
Officer Ronald Peterson.

971
01:11:41,919 --> 01:11:43,685
Might I request that I have

972
01:11:43,687 --> 01:11:45,723
the use of your own
personal vehicle?

973
01:11:47,725 --> 01:11:48,957
Uh, oh.

974
01:11:48,959 --> 01:11:51,760
Oh, uh... okay.

975
01:11:56,234 --> 01:11:58,834
Oh. <i>Star Wars.</i>

976
01:11:58,836 --> 01:12:00,403
Excellent fiction.

977
01:12:00,405 --> 01:12:02,971
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, well, yeah.
- Mm.

978
01:12:02,973 --> 01:12:04,673
It's the, uh...

979
01:12:04,675 --> 01:12:06,108
Red convertible Smart car?

980
01:12:06,110 --> 01:12:07,945
Yes.

981
01:12:16,154 --> 01:12:17,988
Mind how you go.

982
01:12:51,755 --> 01:12:53,858
Slow down a second, Cliff.

983
01:12:58,463 --> 01:12:59,897
Excuse me.

984
01:13:02,133 --> 01:13:04,169
Yes.

985
01:13:06,271 --> 01:13:08,038
Kill the head.

986
01:13:24,822 --> 01:13:28,790
They gravitate towards things
they did when they were alive.

987
01:13:28,792 --> 01:13:30,160
Yeah.

988
01:13:31,996 --> 01:13:34,863
Tennis girl's kind of cute.

989
01:13:34,865 --> 01:13:36,168
Geez, Cliff.

990
01:13:37,968 --> 01:13:41,069
This is way too creepy.

991
01:13:54,752 --> 01:13:56,752
Oh, God.

992
01:13:56,754 --> 01:13:59,021
I know those kids.

993
01:13:59,023 --> 01:14:01,226
But they're all dead.

994
01:14:09,967 --> 01:14:11,867
Watch it, Cliff.

995
01:14:14,071 --> 01:14:16,539
Did you have to do that?

996
01:14:16,541 --> 01:14:18,208
I'm sorry.
I didn't see him.

997
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:20,543
Well, it doesn't matter, Mindy.

998
01:14:20,545 --> 01:14:22,978
They're already dead.

999
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:24,980
Well, undead, to be precise.

1000
01:14:24,982 --> 01:14:26,850
Reanimated.

1001
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,255
Fucking trespasser.

1002
01:14:32,257 --> 01:14:34,192
Kiss your ass goodbye.

1003
01:14:40,398 --> 01:14:44,302
Oh, shit, where are they all
coming from?

1004
01:15:10,027 --> 01:15:11,927
It seems pretty quiet.

1005
01:15:11,929 --> 01:15:15,130
But door number three is open,
so I'm gonna check it out.

1006
01:15:15,132 --> 01:15:17,200
Let's both check it out.

1007
01:15:17,202 --> 01:15:19,204
Well, I'm coming, too.

1008
01:15:38,456 --> 01:15:41,391
Oh, that's bad.

1009
01:16:49,427 --> 01:16:51,429
Sturgill Simpson.

1010
01:17:14,152 --> 01:17:16,053
Oh, my God.

1011
01:17:19,022 --> 01:17:20,958
Why did you do that?

1012
01:17:23,328 --> 01:17:25,330
They're not zombies.

1013
01:17:27,332 --> 01:17:29,499
They're just dead people.

1014
01:17:29,501 --> 01:17:32,235
Well, yeah, for now, they're
still just dead hipsters,

1015
01:17:32,237 --> 01:17:34,102
but they haven't turned yet.

1016
01:17:34,104 --> 01:17:35,571
It can take a while.

1017
01:17:35,573 --> 01:17:37,442
He's right, Mindy.

1018
01:17:39,444 --> 01:17:42,010
Now they're just...

1019
01:17:42,012 --> 01:17:45,949
dead hipsters from Cleveland.

1020
01:17:47,218 --> 01:17:49,050
Oh, my God.

1021
01:17:49,052 --> 01:17:51,754
I can't.

1022
01:17:51,756 --> 01:17:54,057
My God.

1023
01:18:25,356 --> 01:18:28,359
Well, look at all of you.

1024
01:18:30,462 --> 01:18:32,462
So very ravenous,

1025
01:18:32,464 --> 01:18:36,301
yet well past
your expiration date.

1026
01:18:50,281 --> 01:18:53,218
Oh, man.
Get a load of these two.

1027
01:18:54,619 --> 01:18:57,386
Coffee.

1028
01:18:57,388 --> 01:19:01,226
- Coffee.
- Coffee.

1029
01:19:24,147 --> 01:19:25,581
Oh, God.

1030
01:19:25,583 --> 01:19:28,618
Not that again.

1031
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:31,086
Sturgill Simpson.

1032
01:19:31,088 --> 01:19:35,157
- ♪ Oh, the dead don't die ♪
- Great song.

1033
01:19:35,159 --> 01:19:38,427
♪ Any more than you or I ♪

1034
01:19:38,429 --> 01:19:42,865

1035
01:19:42,867 --> 01:19:46,435

1036
01:19:46,437 --> 01:19:50,373

1037
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:53,276
Goddamn it.
I can't take any more.

1038
01:20:00,552 --> 01:20:02,554
That was irrational, Cliff.

1039
01:20:34,552 --> 01:20:36,452
Fuck. Do you think Hank

1040
01:20:36,454 --> 01:20:39,157
and Bobby Wiggins
are still in there?

1041
01:20:41,626 --> 01:20:44,560
Should we try to get 'em out?

1042
01:20:44,562 --> 01:20:47,496
Uh, Cliff, we're drawing
some attention.

1043
01:20:47,498 --> 01:20:50,433
Oh, God, Cliff.

1044
01:20:50,435 --> 01:20:52,935
Please get us out of here.

1045
01:20:52,937 --> 01:20:56,341
Please, Cliff. Please.

1046
01:21:01,779 --> 01:21:03,579
That should hold.

1047
01:21:03,581 --> 01:21:05,717
Goddamn zombies, Bobby.

1048
01:21:21,399 --> 01:21:23,532
I know those guys.

1049
01:21:23,534 --> 01:21:25,434
They were two of
my best customers.

1050
01:21:25,436 --> 01:21:27,403
Yeah, yeah, the Good brothers.

1051
01:21:27,405 --> 01:21:29,672
Travis and Dallas Good.

1052
01:21:29,674 --> 01:21:32,441
They died in a car crash
some time back.

1053
01:21:32,443 --> 01:21:34,543
Oh, shit.

1054
01:21:34,545 --> 01:21:36,746
Yeah, now I remember
those guys.

1055
01:21:36,748 --> 01:21:38,814
The Good brothers.

1056
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:41,450
They were really good guitar pickers.

1057
01:21:41,452 --> 01:21:43,986
That's right.
It's-it's like they came out

1058
01:21:43,988 --> 01:21:48,290
of the birth canal
with guitars in their hands.

1059
01:21:49,694 --> 01:21:53,295
I think you saved my life, man.

1060
01:21:53,297 --> 01:21:54,830
No worries, Hank.

1061
01:22:01,406 --> 01:22:02,672
Shit.

1062
01:22:02,674 --> 01:22:05,474
- What?
- The fucking back door.

1063
01:22:05,476 --> 01:22:07,543
The back door
to the storage room.

1064
01:22:07,545 --> 01:22:10,715
- What?
- Here.

1065
01:22:12,583 --> 01:22:15,618
Jesus, Bobby.

1066
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:17,722
Shit.

1067
01:22:21,426 --> 01:22:23,327
There's way too many, Hank.

1068
01:22:25,329 --> 01:22:26,696
This here is a nightmare,
Bobby.

1069
01:22:26,698 --> 01:22:28,831
We're goners, man.

1070
01:22:28,833 --> 01:22:32,301
Fuck.

1071
01:23:13,077 --> 01:23:14,810
Come on. Give me that!

1072
01:23:14,812 --> 01:23:16,645
Well, I'll be a monkey's ass.

1073
01:23:18,382 --> 01:23:20,382
It's finally payback time.

1074
01:23:20,384 --> 01:23:22,551
You goddamn refugees!
I'll get all of you!

1075
01:23:22,553 --> 01:23:24,820
You're gonna pay for this!

1076
01:23:28,392 --> 01:23:30,426
Get off my property!

1077
01:23:30,428 --> 01:23:31,727
- Hey! Ow!
- Mmm.

1078
01:23:33,598 --> 01:23:35,600
This is good chicken.

1079
01:23:38,436 --> 01:23:40,402
Damn it! Hey!

1080
01:24:03,494 --> 01:24:05,496
You want to get out and check?

1081
01:24:06,931 --> 01:24:10,601
Uh, I'd-I'd rather not.

1082
01:24:13,738 --> 01:24:15,938
Well, that's perfect, isn't it?

1083
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:18,440
Right in the middle
of the fucking cemetery.

1084
01:24:18,442 --> 01:24:21,811
No, it isn't perfect.

1085
01:24:21,813 --> 01:24:24,446
Why did you run over them?

1086
01:24:27,819 --> 01:24:31,687
They are not
ordinary pedestrians.

1087
01:24:46,704 --> 01:24:48,706
This is definitely
gonna end badly.

1088
01:24:51,876 --> 01:24:53,878
Shut up, Ronnie.

1089
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:59,182
No, you shut up.

1090
01:24:59,184 --> 01:25:01,184
Shut up, Ronnie!

1091
01:25:01,186 --> 01:25:04,420
Please stop fighting.

1092
01:25:04,422 --> 01:25:06,789
Please.

1093
01:25:06,791 --> 01:25:09,192
Mindy.

1094
01:25:09,194 --> 01:25:11,696
Mindy...

1095
01:25:16,801 --> 01:25:18,569
It's my grandmother.

1096
01:25:19,837 --> 01:25:22,671
Oh, God, Granny.

1097
01:25:22,673 --> 01:25:24,773
- Mindy, Mindy.
- No.

1098
01:25:24,775 --> 01:25:26,976
Mindy, get it together.

1099
01:25:26,978 --> 01:25:29,511
It was your grandmother.

1100
01:25:32,049 --> 01:25:35,751
I can't take this anymore.

1101
01:25:35,753 --> 01:25:37,920
I can't do it!

1102
01:25:37,922 --> 01:25:40,591
I'm done with this nightmare.

1103
01:25:42,793 --> 01:25:44,227
Granny, I'm coming.

1104
01:25:44,229 --> 01:25:46,795
- I'm coming.
- Mindy?

1105
01:25:46,797 --> 01:25:48,063
No, Mindy! No, don't!

1106
01:25:48,065 --> 01:25:50,499
Oh, no!

1107
01:26:00,645 --> 01:26:02,645
Holy fuck.

1108
01:26:02,647 --> 01:26:04,682
God help us.

1109
01:26:39,951 --> 01:26:41,850
Centerville.

1110
01:26:41,852 --> 01:26:43,554
USA.

1111
01:26:46,891 --> 01:26:49,593
A real nice place.

1112
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:05,776
What an amusing little machine.

1113
01:27:11,716 --> 01:27:13,985
Oh, here's a curious one.

1114
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:23,894
Hello there.

1115
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:27,698
Fashion.

1116
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:32,636
I can assure you
that is not your tartan.

1117
01:27:34,705 --> 01:27:36,073
Nice neck, though.

1118
01:27:59,764 --> 01:28:02,800
Come on. I know
a safe place we can hide.

1119
01:28:14,779 --> 01:28:16,645
Oh, shit.

1120
01:28:16,647 --> 01:28:18,883
Is that Danny Perkins?
Over here.

1121
01:28:21,219 --> 01:28:24,055
Sure looks like him.

1122
01:28:30,628 --> 01:28:33,729
I'm sorry, Ronnie,
if I've lost it.

1123
01:28:33,731 --> 01:28:35,966
It's okay, Cliff.

1124
01:28:37,001 --> 01:28:40,102
But I got to say,

1125
01:28:40,104 --> 01:28:43,138
you have been acting
a lot different

1126
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:46,176
since all this weird shit
started happening.

1127
01:28:46,178 --> 01:28:48,244
What-what are you
saying, Cliff?

1128
01:28:48,246 --> 01:28:53,216
I'm saying that you seem
so oddly controlled.

1129
01:28:53,218 --> 01:28:56,819
I mean, shit.

1130
01:28:56,821 --> 01:29:01,092
Well, I'm just, you know,
dealing with it in my own way.

1131
01:29:03,094 --> 01:29:06,030
But I've been telling you
this is all gonna end badly.

1132
01:29:07,131 --> 01:29:09,131
Goddamn it, Ronnie.

1133
01:29:22,046 --> 01:29:24,079
May I ask you a question?

1134
01:29:24,081 --> 01:29:25,914
Sure. Ask away.

1135
01:29:25,916 --> 01:29:29,118
You have been saying
that this is

1136
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:32,955
all gonna end badly,
from the very beginning,

1137
01:29:32,957 --> 01:29:35,126
over and over.

1138
01:29:37,761 --> 01:29:40,965
So, what made you
so fucking sure of that?

1139
01:29:42,766 --> 01:29:45,801
How did you know everything
in advance?

1140
01:29:45,803 --> 01:29:47,836
Do you really want to know?

1141
01:29:47,838 --> 01:29:49,172
Yes!

1142
01:29:49,174 --> 01:29:51,773
I want to know.
I really want to know!

1143
01:29:51,775 --> 01:29:55,180
Okay. I know because
I've read the script.

1144
01:30:00,117 --> 01:30:02,784
You...

1145
01:30:02,786 --> 01:30:05,055
read the script.

1146
01:30:06,790 --> 01:30:08,792
The whole script?

1147
01:30:10,995 --> 01:30:12,961
All of it?

1148
01:30:12,963 --> 01:30:16,033
Yeah.
Jim gave me the whole script.

1149
01:30:17,302 --> 01:30:20,738
He only gave me our scenes.

1150
01:30:22,740 --> 01:30:26,209
I never saw a complete script.

1151
01:30:26,211 --> 01:30:30,246
After all... I've done
for that guy.

1152
01:30:30,248 --> 01:30:33,817
And it's a lot that
you don't even know about.

1153
01:30:36,954 --> 01:30:39,355
What a dick.

1154
01:31:16,294 --> 01:31:19,127
That's weird.

1155
01:31:19,129 --> 01:31:21,199
They're all leaving.

1156
01:31:44,322 --> 01:31:47,024
Right. Here we go.

1157
01:32:16,187 --> 01:32:21,190
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

1158
01:32:21,192 --> 01:32:23,328
I think I am.

1159
01:32:28,932 --> 01:32:31,867
Was that in the script?

1160
01:32:31,869 --> 01:32:34,069
No.

1161
01:32:34,071 --> 01:32:36,274
Not the one I read.

1162
01:33:21,085 --> 01:33:24,119
Well, that was unexpected.

1163
01:33:24,121 --> 01:33:29,158
I knew there was something
unusual about her.

1164
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:31,061
Yeah.

1165
01:33:33,130 --> 01:33:37,999
So, Ronnie,
how does it end, then?

1166
01:33:38,001 --> 01:33:41,138
Well...

1167
01:33:43,274 --> 01:33:47,008
We got to give it
our best shot.

1168
01:33:47,010 --> 01:33:49,010
"Our best shot."

1169
01:33:49,012 --> 01:33:51,547
Okay. Yeah.

1170
01:33:51,549 --> 01:33:55,451
But then it ends badly, right?

1171
01:33:55,453 --> 01:33:57,286
Uh, yeah.

1172
01:33:57,288 --> 01:33:59,056
Yeah, it does.

1173
01:34:00,191 --> 01:34:02,291
Okay, then.

1174
01:34:02,293 --> 01:34:04,295
Let's do it.

1175
01:34:06,197 --> 01:34:08,266
Let's do it.

1176
01:34:37,262 --> 01:34:40,763
<i>Cliff and little Ronnie.</i>

<i>Remnants of
the materialist people.</i>

1181
01:35:06,291 --> 01:35:10,091
Oh, no, you don't.
No, you don't.

1182
01:35:12,263 --> 01:35:16,599
<i>I guess they've
been zombies all along.</i>

1183
01:35:16,601 --> 01:35:19,100
<i>Ghosts.</i>

1184
01:35:19,102 --> 01:35:20,438
Oh, hey, Bobby.

1185
01:35:22,273 --> 01:35:23,475
Shit.

Frank.

1188
01:35:43,595 --> 01:35:45,394
Hey.

1189
01:35:45,396 --> 01:35:46,564
You got this coming.

1190
01:35:49,534 --> 01:35:51,234
<i>Goodbye, Frank.</i>

1191
01:35:51,236 --> 01:35:52,568
<i>You reap what you sow.</i>

1192
01:35:52,570 --> 01:35:55,540
All right, who's next?

1193
01:35:56,407 --> 01:35:57,442
Ow.

1194
01:36:01,446 --> 01:36:03,281
Yuck.

1195
01:36:06,149 --> 01:36:07,318
All righty.

1196
01:36:11,689 --> 01:36:14,024
Hold your head up.

1197
01:36:19,564 --> 01:36:22,130
Granny.

1198
01:36:22,132 --> 01:36:25,167
Mindy would want you
to say hi to Grandpa.

1199
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:30,542
Ah, Hank.

1200
01:36:32,443 --> 01:36:34,178
I'm so sorry, brother.

1201
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:37,280
I just can't do it.

1202
01:36:37,282 --> 01:36:39,384
You take care of yourself.

1203
01:36:44,455 --> 01:36:47,423
Danny.

1204
01:36:47,425 --> 01:36:49,460
