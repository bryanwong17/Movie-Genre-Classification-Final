1
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,512
It scares us just thinking about it.

2
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,751
When you hear it, you're gonna
think we're insane.

3
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,600
Try us. Please, from the start.

4
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,337
It started out small,

5
00:00:35,862 --> 00:00:38,999
like a hand or a leg was
in a different position.

6
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,555
Then its head was looking up
instead of down.

7
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,758
And then one day, it was in
a completely different room.

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,479
It was moving around by itself.

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,195
Ever think maybe somebody had
a key to your apartment,

10
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:50,817
and was just playing a trick on you?

11
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,033
That's exactly what we thought, but...

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,559
never once did we find any
sign or evidence of intrusion.

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,979
And this all led you to believe
that the doll was possessed?

14
00:00:59,180 --> 00:00:59,980
Yes.

15
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,069
Camilla got in touch with a medium.

16
00:01:02,094 --> 00:01:04,344
We learned from her that
a 7-year-old girl,

17
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,863
named Annabelle Higgins
had died in this apartment.

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,110
She was lonely and took
a liking to my doll.

19
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,632
All she wanted was to be friends.

20
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,456
When we heard this,
we felt really sorry for her.

21
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,000
I mean, we're nurses, we help people.

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,360
So...

23
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,115
we gave her permission
to move into the doll.

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,280
Wait,

25
00:01:25,604 --> 00:01:26,879
you did what?

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,270
She wanted to live with us
by inhabiting the doll.

27
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,635
We said yes.

28
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,860
But then things got worse.

29
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,060
God.

30
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,352
When we came home,
she was sitting in the hallway.

31
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,955
But we had left her in the spare room.

32
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,570
Debbie!

33
00:02:36,095 --> 00:02:37,375
Debbie, wait!

34
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,757
We are beyond terrified.

35
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,434
We don't know what's
going on or what to do.

36
00:03:56,859 --> 00:03:57,944
Can you help us?

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,314
Yes, we can.

38
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,929
Now firstly,
there's no such thing as Annabelle,

39
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,424
and there never was.

40
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,831
Ghosts don't possess such power.

41
00:04:06,855 --> 00:04:10,140
I think what we have here is
something extremely manipulative.

42
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,157
It's something inhuman.

43
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,831
It was a big mistake acknowledging this doll.

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,151
And through that,
the inhuman spirit tricked you.

45
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,980
You gave it permission to infest your lives.

46
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,478
What's an inhuman spirit?

47
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,517
It's something that's never walked
the earth, in human form.

48
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,498
It's something demonic.

49
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,757
So the doll was never possessed?

50
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,439
No, no, it was used as a conduit.

51
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,550
It was moved around to give
the impression of possession.

52
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,988
Demonic spirits don't possess things,

53
00:04:42,113 --> 00:04:43,420
they possess people.

54
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,431
It wanted to get inside of you.

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,356
All right, that's good, Drew.

56
00:04:57,581 --> 00:04:59,015
You can shut it down now.

57
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,030
Hit the lights.

58
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,419
So we got the church to send a priest over

59
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,491
to bless the house and the occupants.

60
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,317
Whatever was oppressing that
apartment was no longer with them.

61
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:13,660
Any questions?

62
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,560
Yes.

63
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,099
Where's the doll now?

64
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,113
Some place safe.

65
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,551
Yep.
So, what are you guys?

66
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,758
I mean, what do people call you?

67
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,341
Well, we've been called Demonologists.

68
00:05:30,365 --> 00:05:31,780
That's one name for us.

69
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,553
Ghost hunters, paranormal researchers.

70
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,736
Kooks.

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,234
Wackos.

72
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,653
But we prefer to be known simply
as Ed and Lorraine Warren.

73
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,734
Here we are.

74
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,480
Hear that?

75
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,239
I don't hear anything.
Exactly.

76
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Okay.

77
00:06:53,824 --> 00:06:56,101
Guys, we are here!
Get out of the car.

78
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,118
Oh, God, we're in the middle of nowhere.

79
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,318
Are you so excited?
Where's my yes? Where's my yes? Yes!

80
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,590
I'll race you!

81
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,991
Are you guys excited?
Yes!

82
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,157
I'm so excited!
Come on, Sadie!

83
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,840
I get my own room!

84
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,674
Are you kidding me?
No dibs on the rooms!

85
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,956
What?
What?

86
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,836
So do I get to pick my own room?
Or do I have no choice in that either?

87
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,467
Well, first cute boy she meets, she'll...

88
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:22,895
forget about Jersey.

89
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,215
Great. I hope.

90
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,475
I can't wait.

91
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,349
Come on, Sadie.

92
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,874
Sadie, let's go.

93
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,473
Hey, come.

94
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,200
What's the matter with you?

95
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,113
Hey, come on, girl.

96
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,878
All right, suit yourself.

97
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,236
Watch your step.

98
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,734
Coming through.

99
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,816
Watch out, Dad.

100
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,712
Where do you want it?
In the living room.

101
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,793
Andrea, where's my wind chime?
I think Nancy's got it in the other room.

102
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,231
Thanks. Hey, Nancy,
have you seen my wind chime?

103
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,039
Oh, this one?
Yeah, thanks.

104
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,634
You're gonna have to catch it.
Nancy! Let go! Give it here.

105
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,079
You're so mean.

106
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,999
Hey, Mom, can I hang up my wind chime?

107
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,390
Of course. There's a line outside
you can hang it on.

108
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,240
Honey, have April come in, okay?
It's gonna be dark soon.

109
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400
Okay.

110
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,878
Come on, April! Mom wants us inside!

111
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,716
Look what I found, Cindy.

112
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,714
One.

113
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,276
Two.

114
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,556
Three.

115
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,598
Come on, come on, come on.
No peeking.

116
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,914
Four.

117
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,238
Are you guys done with the pizza?
I don't want it going to waste.

118
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,835
Let's go.
It's expensive feeding you girls.

119
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,700
Seven.

120
00:09:11,796 --> 00:09:12,796
Eight.

121
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:14,710
Nine.
Where should I hide?

122
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:15,379
Ten.

123
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,172
Ready or not, here I come!

124
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,029
Okay, clap.

125
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,297
Guys!
You don't know the house well enough.

126
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,875
Someone's gonna get hurt.
I'm okay, I'm okay.

127
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,560
Second clap.

128
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,980
That's cheating.

129
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,755
Clap.

130
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,574
Got you!

131
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,841
Are you okay?

132
00:10:03,966 --> 00:10:04,741
Yeah.

133
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,554
All right, what did we break now?

134
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,212
I... Yeah, yeah. I. I didn't mean to.
Move out of there, please.

135
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,733
It was Christine's fault.

136
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,731
Oh, jeez.
My fault? Oh, my God.

137
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,712
Christine did it.
No, I didn't.

138
00:10:14,736 --> 00:10:16,531
Yeah! Shut up!
No! You pushed me.

139
00:10:16,555 --> 00:10:17,599
No, no, you fell back.

140
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,074
Hey, Nancy, can you go get me
the matches, please?

141
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,316
What's going on?

142
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,772
Nancy broke something.
Shut up.

143
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,512
What broke?
It's the wall.

144
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,818
I think we have a cellar or something.

145
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,180
I wanna see, I wanna see.
Push. Ok.

146
00:10:32,204 --> 00:10:34,039
Move, move, move.
Look.

147
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,155
Here, matches. Thank you.

148
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,853
You can see.

149
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,873
I wanna see too.
You can all see.

150
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,235
Move!

151
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,072
Oh, man.

152
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,909
Roger?

153
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,355
What do you see down there?

154
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,639
Just... hard to tell you know?

155
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,956
It's an old piano
and a whole bunch of garbage.

156
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,616
Son of a...

157
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,034
Rog?

158
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,000
Come on up.

159
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,259
I don't want you girls going down there.

160
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,639
That place is loaded with spiders.

161
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,076
Just relax. Okay.

162
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,550
Stop it, Nancy. It's not funny.

163
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,814
We've got extra square footage anyway.

164
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,755
I'll check it out in the morning.

165
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,691
I wonder why it was boarded up.
I don't know.

166
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,881
Okay guys, show's over.
Five minutes.

167
00:11:51,906 --> 00:11:52,903
No more minutes.

168
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,396
Up to bed. Please. Thank you.
Right to bed.

169
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,920
Man, I'm fried.

170
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,373
Something's up with Sadie.

171
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,949
Yeah, I don't know what her problem is.

172
00:12:07,074 --> 00:12:08,414
Couldn't get her to come inside.

173
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,753
We can't leave her out there.

174
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,671
She's all right. I got her on a chain.

175
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,959
Sadie, hey, be quiet.

176
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,752
Thanks for making this work.

177
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,998
I know it was a lot to bite off.

178
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,109
It's gonna be great, isn't it?

179
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,652
I think it's great already.

180
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,110
Yeah.

181
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,794
You still too fried to christen the new house?

182
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,440
Who said I'm fried?

183
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,994
Ain't nobody here's fried.

184
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,589
Mom?

185
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,196
Hey. How did you guys sleep?

186
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,550
I'm cold.

187
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,234
It is chilly, isn't it?

188
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,236
You think maybe we could have bot
a house with a toilet that actually works?

189
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,436
Tell your father.

190
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,933
And there was a funky smell
in my bedroom last night.

191
00:13:31,934 --> 00:13:32,979
We think something died.

192
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,173
Is it still there?

193
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,876
No.
Problem solved.

194
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,550
Roger?

195
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,520
Roger?

196
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,334
Down here, honey.

197
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,636
Morning.

198
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,920
This is gonna take some
serious elbow grease.

199
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,220
Yeah.

200
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,873
Oh, my God.

201
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,632
What are we gonna do with all this stuff?

202
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:35,326
Well, we probably ought to go through it.

203
00:14:35,851 --> 00:14:38,890
You know, there might be some antiques
down here worth a lot of money.

204
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,634
Yeah or just a lot of junk
the previous owner didn't want.

205
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,517
It's ours now.
Knock yourself out.

206
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,757
I'm gonna make some coffee.
Okay.

207
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,119
I'll be up in a minute. I'm gonna see
if I can get this furnace working.

208
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,918
Yeah, that'd be nice. It's freezing.

209
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,230
Yeah.

210
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,034
Sadie! Come here, Sadie!

211
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,435
Mommy!

212
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,274
Mommy, where's Sadie?

213
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,231
She's outside. You know,
I'm sure she's hungry by now.

214
00:15:15,256 --> 00:15:16,377
Why don't you go and get her.

215
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,160
Morning, Dad.

216
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,752
Can you hold this?
Sure.

217
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,793
Sadie!
Slow it down, Scoot.

218
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,235
Roger.
Yeah.

219
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,358
This clock stopped at 3:07,
and so did the one in the hallway.

220
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,120
That's weird.

221
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,798
Maybe it got knocked around in the move.

222
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,839
Speaking of knocked around,
what did you do to me last night?

223
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,754
Ouch. I didn't do that. Did I?
I don't know.

224
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,355
Sadie!

225
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,080
April!

226
00:15:52,555 --> 00:15:53,555
April!

227
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,118
What's... April!

228
00:15:55,243 --> 00:15:56,340
What's going on?

229
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,590
What happened?
Oh, my God!

230
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,400
Oh, Sadie.

231
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,557
We keep everything locked in here.

232
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,753
Feel free to look around.

233
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,793
Just don't touch anything.

234
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,520
This is crazy.

235
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,799
So all these are taken from
cases you've investigated?

236
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,790
That's right.

237
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:32,324
Everything you see in
here is either haunted,

238
00:16:32,349 --> 00:16:35,773
cursed or has been used in some
kind of ritualistic practice.

239
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,993
Nothing's a toy.

240
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,833
Not even the toy monkey.

241
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,714
Don't touch it.

242
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,075
Well, isn't it scary or...

243
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,836
doesn't it worry you to have all
these items right in your home?

244
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,091
That's why we have a priest that comes by
once a month to bless the room.

245
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,755
Well, the way I see it is.

246
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,560
It's safer for these things
to be in here than out there.

247
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,618
It's kind of like keeping guns
off the street.

248
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,876
Why not just throw them in an incinerator?
Destroy them.

249
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,538
Well, that would only destroy the vessel.

250
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,159
Sometimes it's better to keep
the genie in the bottle.

251
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,493
Say is the...

252
00:17:13,018 --> 00:17:14,318
Annabelle doll here?

253
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,474
Right this way.

254
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,875
Yeah.

255
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,315
You said she's a conduit?
That's right.

256
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,675
What does that mean?

257
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,675
A very powerful demonic
has latched itself onto her.

258
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,899
So when you guys investigate
these haunting,

259
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,191
how do you stop them
from latching onto you?

260
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,919
We have to take great precaution.

261
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,713
But what about your wife?

262
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,954
What about her?

263
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,878
Well, Father Gordon told me that...

264
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,420
Well, that was different.

265
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,879
What happened to my wife
happened during an exorcism.

266
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,513
Well, what's the difference?

267
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,555
Excuse me.

268
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,789
Honey, what are you doing?

269
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,390
Come here.

270
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,910
You know better. All right?

271
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,514
Georgiana?

272
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,076
Come on. Did you touch anything?
No.

273
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,560
All right, come on, honey.

274
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,960
Georgiana! Could you take Judy upstairs?
Oh, sure.

275
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,589
You can't go into this room,
no matter what, remember?

276
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,194
Yes, Daddy.
All right.

277
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,100
Go on.

278
00:18:24,124 --> 00:18:26,665
Okay, come on. Let's see if I can
find you a little snack, okay?

279
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,503
Come on.

280
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,438
Hey.

281
00:18:37,363 --> 00:18:39,242
What's going on in here?
Daddy, look.

282
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:40,853
You look very pretty.

283
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,942
All right, all done.

284
00:18:42,267 --> 00:18:44,532
Go get dressed for dinner.
I'm wearing it to dinner.

285
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:45,878
No, you're not!

286
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,355
Here you go.

287
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,440
How'd it go?

288
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,717
Oh, I think he may write a positive article.

289
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,792
A non-skeptic.

290
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,675
That's a pleasant change.

291
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,890
Yeah.

292
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,633
Stop blaming yourself.

293
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,034
No sugar.

294
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,674
Be right back.

295
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,437
Not funny, Nancy.

296
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,729
What?

297
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,597
Stop grabbing my foot.

298
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,917
Shut up, I didn't do anything.

299
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,194
Yeah, right.

300
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,877
And stop farting.

301
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,118
It really stinks.

302
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,631
Don't blame that on me. It's you.

303
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,390
Dad?

304
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,592
Andrea, what are you doing out of bed?

305
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,035
What's that sound?

306
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,227
It's Cindy. She's in my room.

307
00:23:02,252 --> 00:23:04,138
She's sleepwalking again.

308
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,677
I've never seen her do this before.

309
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,230
I remembered you saying not
to wake her if she's like this.

310
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,312
No, we just put her back to bed.

311
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,195
Hey, hey. Sweetie.

312
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,155
Let's go back to bed.

313
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,953
She's okay. Good night.

314
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,315
Night.

315
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,438
She's sleepwalking again?
She hasn't done that for awhile.

316
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,192
She ended up in Andrea's room too.
I think kind of freaked her out.

317
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,955
That's not good. What are we gonna do?
I don't know. Honey?

318
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,680
You got another bruise here.

319
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,280
Does that hurt?

320
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,356
That's weird.

321
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,073
I don't know. Will you do me a favor,
go see a doctor for that?

322
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,396
Yeah, I will. Drive safe.

323
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,190
Yeah.

324
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,503
I love you.
I love you too.

325
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,076
Bye!

326
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,720
Love you!

327
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,759
Cindy, you have your lunch?
Yeah.

328
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,391
Yes, I do.

329
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,392
I miss Sadie a lot.

330
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,916
She was my best friend.

331
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,998
You're my friend, right?

332
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,239
Yeah, let's play.

333
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,746
Who are you talking to?

334
00:25:27,271 --> 00:25:28,139
Rory.

335
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,520
Rory?

336
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,072
He's my new friend.
Oh, really?

337
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,412
Yeah, do you want to see him?
Yeah.

338
00:25:35,036 --> 00:25:36,914
How?
With this.

339
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,256
When the music stops, you see him
in the mirror standing behind you.

340
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,790
Okay.

341
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,872
But you have to twist the key.

342
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,135
Okay.

343
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,000
Boo, Mommy!

344
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,779
April, you just gave me a heart attack.
Got you!

345
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,412
Well, okay, I guess Rory
doesn't want to see me?

346
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,309
Oh, well.

347
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,153
Can we play hide-and-clap?

348
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,996
Hide-and-cla...
Oh, honey, I don't want to play.

349
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,956
Please! Nobody ever lets me play.
Okay, okay.

350
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,279
Remember, you get to ask
me for three claps.

351
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,844
Okay.
One.

352
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:37,208
Two.

353
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:38,533
Three.

354
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,779
I'm gonna go hide now!
Okay.

355
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,840
Four.

356
00:26:40,993 --> 00:26:41,993
Five.

357
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,680
Six.

358
00:26:44,091 --> 00:26:45,191
Seven.

359
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,720
Eight.

360
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:48,355
Nine.

361
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,855
Ten.

362
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,154
First clap!

363
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,078
Shit.

364
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,754
Second clap!

365
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,036
April.

366
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,434
April.

367
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,674
Oh, I know where you're hiding.

368
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,951
Give me the third clap.

369
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,254
I'm gonna get you now.

370
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,039
I can hear you breathing.

371
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,840
April.

372
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,440
April.

373
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,636
You took your blindfold off. I win!

374
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,975
You weren't even warm, Mom.
I was in Christine and Nancy's room.

375
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,795
I gotta have some routes here,
or I'm gonna lose the insurance on the rig.

376
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,380
That's like half of my rate, man.

377
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,152
Yeah, okay.

378
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,756
I'll... Yeah, I'll take it.

379
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,675
Thank you.

380
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,259
What's the route?
It's... Florida.

381
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,040
It's a week turnaround. I start tomorrow.

382
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,454
We'll get through this.

383
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,596
Yeah.

384
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,080
Come on, let's go to bed.

385
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,996
Stop it, Nancy. It's not funny anymore.

386
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,232
I'm trying to sleep,
please stop grabbing my feet.

387
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,034
Nancy?

388
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,599
Nancy?

389
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,719
What are you doing?

390
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,640
Christine?

391
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,430
Are you all right?

392
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,760
Do you see it?

393
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,755
See what?

394
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,311
There's someone behind the door.

395
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,709
What?

396
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,920
There's someone standing over there.

397
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,396
I don't see anyone.

398
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,150
It's looking right at us.

399
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,920
Nancy, don't! Nancy.

400
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,515
No, no. Look. Look.

401
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,151
Look, there's no one here. See?

402
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,494
It's that smell again.

403
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,271
Oh, my God.

404
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,913
It's standing right behind you.

405
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,918
Christine! Christine! Christine!

406
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,440
God, it won't op...

407
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,712
Christine!
No! No! No!

408
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,913
What's going on? What happened?
There was someone else in here!

409
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,116
What?
Where?

410
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,557
By the door. It was behind the door.

411
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,275
Honey, there's nothing in here.
There's nobody in here.

412
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,238
There was someone else in here!

413
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,838
I was just sleeping, and then
I felt somebody grab my feet.

414
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,310
So I thought it was Nancy.

415
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,397
Well, honey, I'm pretty sure
that it was just a bad dream.

416
00:33:28,421 --> 00:33:31,655
No! No! It talked to me!

417
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,838
It said...

418
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,870
that it wants my family dead.

419
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,389
Mr. Winston!

420
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,953
Winston? Winston?

421
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,320
Get behind him.

422
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,156
Where you off to?

423
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,589
I just gotta run to the store
for a few things.

424
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,704
Why do you even try?

425
00:33:58,929 --> 00:34:00,283
What? What do you mean?

426
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,880
In 15 years have you
ever been able to lie to me?

427
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,899
Father Gordon called. He's got
a case he wants us to look into.

428
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,651
I said I'd go check it out myself.

429
00:34:08,676 --> 00:34:10,934
Lorraine, myself.
I'm going with you.

430
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,270
I know you're worried
it's gonna happen again.

431
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,238
Yeah, I am. I really am.

432
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,196
Maybe it's just time we take a break.

433
00:34:22,721 --> 00:34:23,944
Write that book.

434
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,954
Do you remember what you said
to me on our wedding night?

435
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,959
Can we do it again?

436
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,990
After that.

437
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,982
You said that God brought
us together for a reason.

438
00:34:39,307 --> 00:34:40,253
Right?

439
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,359
I'm pretty sure it's not to write a book.

440
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,713
I'm gonna get dressed.

441
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,419
We've isolated
the disturbances to the attic.

442
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,340
I just want you to listen for a second, Ok.

443
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,200
Oh, my God, that's it.

444
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,254
Do it again, Ed.

445
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,754
Right now it's just my weight.

446
00:35:04,055 --> 00:35:05,875
But you take the water
coming off the pipe,

447
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,380
combined with the wind coming
through the broken window,

448
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,850
these boards are gonna expand
and rub against each other.

449
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,156
You heard it all through the house
because of these pipes,

450
00:35:13,481 --> 00:35:14,739
leading to the radiator.

451
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,032
So this place isn't haunted?

452
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,693
No, it rarely is.

453
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,455
Yeah, there's usually always
some kind of rational explanation.

454
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,440
Girls, it's way past your bedtime.

455
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,040
Who is that?

456
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,000
Who's ever down there,
I'm gonna lock you in now!

457
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,334
Help!

458
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,398
Andrea! Help!

459
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,515
Hey, wanna play hide-and-clap?

460
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,389
Cindy?

461
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,032
Okay, now...

462
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,509
All right?

463
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,274
All right, come on.

464
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,869
Come on.

465
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,115
There you go.

466
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,077
Okay, you can just sleep with me tonight,
all right?

467
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,314
There you go.

468
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,870
There.

469
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,955
Andrea?
Help! Help! Help!

470
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,753
Who's in here?
Andrea!

471
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,116
Andrea? Andrea!

472
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,396
In here!

473
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,035
Help, Daddy! Help, it's Andrea!

474
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,634
Who's in here?
Andrea!

475
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,600
What happened?

476
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,295
Somebody, goddamn it,
tell me what's going on here?

477
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,581
Fear is defined as a feeling of agitation,

478
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:24,054
and anxiety caused by the presence
or imminence of danger.

479
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:28,632
Whether it's a ghost, a spirit
or an entity, they all feed on it.

480
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,936
Take Maurice here.

481
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,859
A French-Canadian farmer with noting
more than a third-grade education,

482
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:37,076
yet after he was possessed,
spoke some of the best Latin I'd ever heard.

483
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,369
Sometimes backwards.

484
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,150
He'd been molested by his father,
who had also tortured him repeatedly.

485
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,796
A dark spirit made its home in this man.

486
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,398
Now, if you look into his eyes,
you can see him tearing blood.

487
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,394
And like that,

488
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:03,713
an upside-down cross started
to appear from within his body.

489
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,671
All right, Drew, you can hit the lights.

490
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,716
Did you personally perform the exorcism?

491
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,719
No, I'm not authorized.
But I've assisted on many.

492
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,832
See, an exorcism
can be very dangerous,

493
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,038
not only for the victim,
but for anyone in the room.

494
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,006
So what happened to Maurice?

495
00:44:23,031 --> 00:44:24,399
Well he tried to kill his wife,

496
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,432
but instead shot her in the arm
and then turned the gun on himself.

497
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,137
Maurice had a very troubled life
with little to live for...

498
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,279
and not even an exorcist
could bring him back.

499
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:38,278
Which brings us to the three stages
of demonic activity:

500
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,571
Infestation, oppression and possession.

501
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:41,994
The infestation that's,

502
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:46,020
that's the whispering, the footsteps,
the feeling of another presence,

503
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,623
which ultimately grows into oppression.

504
00:44:48,648 --> 00:44:49,774
The second stage.

505
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,379
Now this is where the victim,

506
00:44:51,403 --> 00:44:54,261
and it's usually the one who's the
most psychologically vulnerable,

507
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,279
is targeted specifically
by an external force.

508
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,677
Breaks the victim down.
Crushes their will.

509
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,980
And once in a weakened state,
leads them to the third and final stage,

510
00:45:05,305 --> 00:45:06,404
possession.

511
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,999
Hey, Ed? Lorraine?
Yeah.

512
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,495
There's someone here
that would like to talk to you.

513
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,896
Hi.
Thanks, Drew.

514
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,340
Thank you.
I'll see you later.

515
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,670
How can we help you?

516
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,170
There's something horrible
happening in my house.

517
00:45:20,495 --> 00:45:22,177
Could you come and take a look?

518
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,839
You know, it's getting kinda late.

519
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,394
We really need to head to our family.
No, you don't understand.

520
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,380
But we do.

521
00:45:28,505 --> 00:45:29,863
There's usually some sort of rational explanation...

522
00:45:29,887 --> 00:45:32,451
I have five daughters
who are scared to death.

523
00:45:32,676 --> 00:45:34,480
I'm so afraid this thing wants to hurt us.

524
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,379
You have a daughter.

525
00:45:36,404 --> 00:45:38,979
Wouldn't you do anything you
could to protect her? Please.

526
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,816
Please can you come and take a look?

527
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,235
Of course we will.

528
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,600
Of course we will.

529
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,671
Come on, Jan! Open up!

530
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,060
Jan, what happened?

531
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,879
The top of your head turned black.

532
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:08,533
You guys straighten up? Thanks.

533
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,398
Don't be silly, it's a wig.

534
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,680
Hello. Hi.
Hi. Hi.

535
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,240
Thanks for coming.

536
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,913
Hi, I'm Roger.
Lorraine.

537
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,896
Hey, nice to meet you Roger, Ed Warren.

538
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,638
Thanks for coming.
Please, come in.

539
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,035
Thank you.

540
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,670
So...

541
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,774
Oh, my God. Look at you all.

542
00:46:30,775 --> 00:46:32,199
Who are these beautiful
young women?

543
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,557
This is Andrea, the oldest,
Nancy, Cindy, Christine,

544
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,119
and April.

545
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,274
It's Mr. and Mrs. Warren.

546
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,254
We're all sleeping down here now.

547
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,754
The girls feel safer and it's warmer.

548
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,236
I'm constantly turning up the heat,
but the house is always freezing.

549
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,512
It's not a problem with the furnace,

550
00:46:52,536 --> 00:46:53,755
so I mean, not that I can find.

551
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,055
It's gotten a lot worse the past few nights.

552
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,820
There's this...

553
00:47:05,645 --> 00:47:07,756
awful smell, like rotting meat.

554
00:47:07,981 --> 00:47:09,387
It moves around the house.

555
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,635
What? What is it?

556
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,335
Well, rancid smells could...

557
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:20,643
indicate some type of demonic activity.

558
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,430
Oh, my God.

559
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,556
That's to keep those doors
from banging at night.

560
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,032
Otherwise, it's like...

561
00:47:30,957 --> 00:47:32,281
All night long, just like that.

562
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,637
Does it come in threes?
Yeah.

563
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,950
It stops at dawn?

564
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,037
Well, sometimes it's meant
as an insult to the Trinity.

565
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,157
The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

566
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,776
You know, it's the damnedest thing,
but we also get all kinds of birds,

567
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,839
that will just fly against the side
of the house and break their necks.

568
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,300
Really?

569
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,030
And the clocks stop at 3:07 a.m.

570
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,271
All of them?
Every one.

571
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,434
Oh, we were hanging those along the stairs.

572
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:11,779
Something just kept knocking them down,
so we stopped hanging them up.

573
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,596
That's what I was talking about.

574
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,673
It was here when we moved in.

575
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,036
There's also a lot of stuff in the cellar.

576
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,440
Show me the cellar.

577
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,155
Look what she made me do.

578
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,790
You picking up anything in here, hon?

579
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,874
Something awful happened here, Ed.

580
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:57,512
Those bruises, they from something
that happened here?

581
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,520
Oh, it's some iron deficiency thing I have.

582
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,870
You know, with all that's been going on,
why haven't you just moved out?

583
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,357
I don't know where
we'd move to, you know?

584
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,833
We got all our money tied up in this place
and had a lot of repairs on top of that.

585
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,474
And I don't know anybody whose gonna
take in a family of seven indefinitely.

586
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,358
That's why we tracked you down.

587
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,793
We're glad you found us.

588
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,490
All right, let's get started.

589
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,357
My name is Ed Warren.
It's November 1st, 1971.

590
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,352
I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...

591
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,780
who, with her family,

592
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,743
has been experiencing
supernatural occurrences.

593
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,120
Okay, go ahead.

594
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,040
Where do I start?

595
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,273
From the first occurrence.

596
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,257
I guess it was the clocks.

597
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,477
Mom and Dad tell me
that you have a friend.

598
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,871
His name's Rory.
He lives here too.

599
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,872
But he's always sad.

600
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,076
Why is that?

601
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,029
He won't tell me but I think
something bad happened to him.

602
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,991
Do you mind if I try to see Rory?

603
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,150
Hey.

604
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,195
What is it?

605
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,479
We bot it at auction from the bank, so,
you know, we never knew who lived here.

606
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:24,360
Well, Lorraine and I both feel that
what your house needs is a cleansing.

607
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,835
An exorcism.

608
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,874
What, exorcism?

609
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,799
I thought that was something
that you do to people.

610
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,354
No, not necessarily, no.

611
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,320
We have to get out of here.

612
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,472
I'm afraid that's not gonna help.

613
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,796
Lorraine saw something, which...

614
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,235
Go ahead, hon.

615
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,037
I've been seeing the dark entity
that haunts your house,

616
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,714
and your land.

617
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,756
I saw it first when I came
through your door.

618
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,116
It was latched to your back.

619
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,679
And then I saw it again with the girls
when we walked into the living room.

620
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,876
And it doesn't matter where you go,

621
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,298
this dark entity has latched itself
to your family,

622
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,874
and it's feeding off you.

623
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,077
Even if we leave?

624
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:27,214
Sometimes when you get haunted,
it's like stepping on gum.

625
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,258
You take it with you.

626
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:33,612
Look, I gotta tell you,
you have a lot of spirits in here,

627
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:38,377
but this is the one that I'm most
worried about, because it is so hateful.

628
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,999
Okay, so what do we do?
Can we call a priest?

629
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,480
I wish it were that easy.

630
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,434
Performing an exorcism is an archaic
procedure. Requires years of training.

631
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,560
And even then,
I have seen it go horribly wrong.

632
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,230
But before we even get that far,
the church has to authorize it first.

633
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,632
It means we gotta investigate,
gather evidence and provide proof,

634
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,320
and that's the hard part.

635
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,199
Have your children been baptized?

636
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:10,673
No, we never got around to that.
We're not really a churchgoing family.

637
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,659
Well, you may want to rethink that.

638
00:54:13,184 --> 00:54:14,640
Our presence here could
make things worse.

639
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,696
Why?

640
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,314
Because we're a threat.

641
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,299
And whatever you're dealing with here
isn't gonna like us.

642
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:24,110
So far it hasn't done anything violent,
and that's a good sign.

643
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:27,199
So we're gonna have our guy
do some homework on the property,

644
00:54:27,223 --> 00:54:28,958
to see what we're up against.

645
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,898
Judy, what are you up to?

646
00:54:33,222 --> 00:54:34,714
I got you a present.

647
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,352
Me and Nanna got these
at the church's yard sale.

648
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,652
Honey.
One for you and one for me.

649
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,515
She put a picture of you
and Daddy in mine.

650
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,192
Nanna said this way
we'll always be together.

651
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,775
You'll be with me and I'll be with you.

652
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,677
I miss you and Daddy.

653
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,436
Hey, hon.

654
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,251
You're not gonna believe this.

655
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:14,338
Carolyn's voice didn't record.

656
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,116
What do you mean?

657
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,275
Listen.

658
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,237
My name is Ed Warren.
It's November 1st, 1971.

659
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,232
I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron,

660
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,431
who, with her family,

661
00:55:25,456 --> 00:55:27,661
has been experiencing
supernatural occurrences.

662
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,554
Okay, go ahead.

663
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,598
From the first occurrence.

664
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,475
Nothing.

665
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,230
The whole time.

666
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,055
I don't know. You find anything?

667
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:44,679
Lots.

668
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,159
I mean, it's no wonder they're
going through what they are.

669
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,752
That's the original farmhouse.

670
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,239
It was built in 1863 by a man
named Jedson Sherman,

671
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,755
who was married to a woman
named Bathsheba.

672
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:59,192
Ed, she's related to Mary Towne Estye.

673
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,511
She was one of the women
accused of witchcraft in Salem.

674
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,992
She was hung during the trials.

675
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,839
After Bathsheba married Jedson,
they had a baby,

676
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,938
and when the baby was 7 days old,.

677
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:11,819
Jedson cat her sacrificing it
in front of the fireplace.

678
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,951
She ran out to that tree by the dock,

679
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,639
climbed up, proclaimed
her love to Satan,

680
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:20,020
cursed anyone who tried
to take her land, and hung herself.

681
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,856
Time of death was pronounced at 3:07
in the morning.

682
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,039
Well, that explains a few things.

683
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,559
Yeah, so does this.

684
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,579
Her last name's Walker.
She lived there in the '30s.

685
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:36,418
She had a boy named Rory who
mysteriously disappeared in the woods.

686
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:38,678
Then she killed herself in the cellar.

687
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,756
And that's not all.

688
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:47,710
So, what was the original 200-acre farm
has since been subdivided and sold off.

689
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,364
There was another boy
who drowned in a pond here.

690
00:56:50,389 --> 00:56:51,904
He lived in a house over here.

691
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:56,159
And a woman who worked as a maid in a
neighboring home, she committed suicide too.

692
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,912
People who took her land.

693
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,796
I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...

694
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:07,158
who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.

695
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,080
Okay, go ahead.

696
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,357
From the first occurrence.

697
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,029
Here's Brad.

698
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,440
You find it okay?
Oh, yeah.

699
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,259
Drew, this is Officer Brad.

700
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,875
Officer Brad Hamilton,
Harrisville, Rhode Island P.D.

701
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:03,618
Nice to meet you, man.

702
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,286
So you're the lucky new cop?

703
00:58:06,711 --> 00:58:07,734
Guess so.

704
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,581
You know you can't shoot ghosts, right?

705
00:58:09,806 --> 00:58:11,062
Take it easy on him, Drew.

706
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:12,931
Okay guys, help me get this stuff unloaded.

707
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,074
You take this.

708
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,390
Hi, Roger.

709
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,160
All right.

710
00:58:25,223 --> 00:58:28,411
When you're finished here, why don't
you hit upstairs, all right, Drew?

711
00:58:28,412 --> 00:58:29,276
You got it.

712
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,679
What's wrong with the Chevy?

713
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,272
What's not wrong with her?

714
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,891
Needs a new carburetor to start.
Oh, yeah?

715
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,572
Kind of put fixing her up
on hold for a while.

716
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,040
Yeah.

717
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,411
Hey, Brad, hand me a thermostat,
would you?

718
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,150
What's this... do?

719
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,839
When there's an instant
drop in temperature,

720
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,075
the thermostat
triggers the camera to take a picture.

721
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,557
You've actually cat things on film?

722
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,320
Well, yeah, that's... the point.

723
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:26,232
Why? Why out here?

724
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:29,160
Well, this is where the witch
committed suicide.

725
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,953
She hung herself from that branch
right above where you're standing.

726
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,712
How could a mother kill her own child?

727
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,018
It was never a child to her.

728
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:48,710
She just used her God-given gift
as the ultimate offense against him.

729
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:52,152
Witches believe it elevates their status
in the eyes of Satan.

730
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:05,211
That's a nice day at the beach?

731
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,478
How did you know?

732
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,133
It's an insight.

733
01:00:09,134 --> 01:00:12,021
It's like a peek through the curtain
into another person's life.

734
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,260
That day meant so much to me.

735
01:00:18,485 --> 01:00:20,464
We were driving along the coast.

736
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,995
Nancy pointed out
how pretty the view was.

737
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,713
I thought this is a perfect opportunity
for a photo.

738
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,032
We're gonna start fresh, you know?
A new house, a new beginning.

739
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:33,557
You should have seen Roger and the girls.
I've never seen them so happy.

740
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:34,870
Cheese!

741
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,637
They mean the world to me.

742
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,072
Put your hand flat on the desk.

743
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,438
Yeah, and take it off.

744
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,394
Here we go.

745
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:04,876
See?

746
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,396
It just reveals to us what
the naked eye can't see.

747
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,080
Pretty far out, isn't it?

748
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,679
Yeah, it's groovy.

749
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,557
Drew, you got the Bolex ready for Brad?

750
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,070
Yeah, already locked and loaded, sir.

751
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,015
What? I had to go.

752
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,800
All the rooms are coming in pretty good.

753
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:08,960
Good.

754
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,154
What's in the bottle?

755
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:17,996
Holy water.

756
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,550
Presence of religious icons will...

757
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,458
get a reaction from anything unholy.

758
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,199
Sort of pisses them off.

759
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:33,991
So I set these thought the house,
see if I can stir things up a bit.

760
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,269
Like holding a cross to a vampire?
Yeah. Exactly.

761
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,191
Except I don't believe in vampires.

762
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:49,509
Wasn't me.

763
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,520
Brad, get the camera.

764
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,430
Okay.

765
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:21,092
All right, it's 9:18, we're headed down into the
cellar where the door's just opened on its own.

766
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,199
I have Lorraine and Officer Brad Hamilton
with me.

767
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,557
Let's keep the cellar light off.

768
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:43,394
Give us a sign that you wanna
communicate with us.

769
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,434
Hon, you all right?

770
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,235
There's definitely something here.

771
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,758
All right, close the door. Move something.
My hands are so cold.

772
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,315
Come on.

773
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,630
No.

774
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,439
It's gone. It's gone.

775
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,120
I got nothing.

776
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,760
Okay.

777
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,797
Well, like I said, it doesn't always work
when you want it to.

778
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,755
Yeah, maybe the camera picked
something up.

779
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,835
Watch out!

780
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,154
For a guy who doesn't believe,

781
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:17,677
you looked a little freaked out
when that door slammed shut.

782
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,597
It must have been a draft.

783
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,799
Oh, that's funny.

784
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,915
A draft never put that look
on my face before.

785
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,353
I believe the clock.

786
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,593
It's 3:08.

787
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,359
Let me see your glasses.

788
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,716
For you.

789
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:51,817
I think I might take some
girls for ice cream later on.

790
01:05:51,818 --> 01:05:53,054
What do you say about that?

791
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:55,391
Honey, you wanna come?
No.

792
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:56,585
I'm, I'm exhausted.

793
01:05:56,585 --> 01:05:58,863
I'm just gonna take a nap.
The late nights are getting to me.

794
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,850
That's probably a good idea.
Why don't you get some rest.

795
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,955
Lorraine and I'll watch over things for a bit.
Really?

796
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:06,440
I'm gonna take off.
I have a shift starting in an hour.

797
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,751
The house hasn't felt like this
in a long time.

798
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,873
I think the kids feel a lot safer
with you around.

799
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,275
I could get used to this.
What, me doing laundry?

800
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:21,932
You're funny.

801
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:24,094
No, this place.

802
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,471
Nice, fresh country air.

803
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,840
They have such a beautiful family,
don't they?

804
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,364
Yeah, that little one,

805
01:06:34,989 --> 01:06:35,919
April,

806
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:37,596
did you see her bring me pancakes?
Yeah.

807
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,513
We've gotta help them.

808
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:46,700
I know.

809
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,269
I'll start with the Chevy.

810
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,515
Carolyn!

811
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,596
Are you okay?

812
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:16,910
Carolyn, open the door.

813
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,150
Carolyn, open up!

814
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,196
Are you okay?

815
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:27,635
Oh, I'm fine.
Are you sick?

816
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:31,034
I woke up feeling nauseous, that's all.
I thought I saw...

817
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:32,731
I hear Roger and the girls.

818
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,270
One minute.

819
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,637
Guys, do you wanna play a game?
Boring!

820
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:49,916
Thank you, Daddy.

821
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,350
Let's go inside.

822
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,790
I thought that was you.

823
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,599
Hey, I hope you don't mind.

824
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,240
I got a good deal on a rebuild
at that wrecking yard in Smithfield.

825
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:04,878
No, you look like you know what you're doing.
Yeah, we'll see.

826
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,879
Got a nice place here, Roger.

827
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,390
Lorraine and I always wanted
a spot in the country.

828
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,080
I'll sell you this one.

829
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,894
Hey, hand me a wrench, would you?

830
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,250
Hey...

831
01:09:22,775 --> 01:09:24,803
it really means a lot
to us to have you here.

832
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:27,612
I gotta admit, I was a little
bit skeptical going in.

833
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:32,272
Just wanna say thank you, though,
for coming out when you did.

834
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,228
I can't take the credit. That's...

835
01:09:36,353 --> 01:09:37,701
That's all Lorraine.

836
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,201
I didn't want to.

837
01:09:39,726 --> 01:09:40,818
Why's that?

838
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:47,024
Whatever Lorraine sees, feels, touches,

839
01:09:47,025 --> 01:09:49,297
it helps people but it also takes a toll on her.

840
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,694
Little piece each time.

841
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,780
Couple months ago
we were working on a case.

842
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,159
She saw something.

843
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,494
It took a real big piece.

844
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,634
When we got home,

845
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:19,933
she went into our room, locked herself in,

846
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,334
didn't talk, didn't eat,
didn't come out for eight days.

847
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,120
What'd she see?

848
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,309
Get out of here!

849
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,629
I don't know.

850
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,799
And I won't ask.

851
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:54,352
I need to reload. You want some?

852
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,554
I'm good, thanks.

853
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,675
All right.

854
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,232
Look what she made me do.

855
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:31,230
Look what she made me do.

856
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,080
Hey.

857
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:43,756
Ed?

858
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,155
Look what she made me do!

859
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,953
Ed! Ed!

860
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:50,829
Ed!

861
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,155
Dude, you okay?

862
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:54,800
Hold up, Brad. What's going on?

863
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,873
I saw someone.
There was a woman dressed as a maid.

864
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,517
Ed? Ed, we're getting something.

865
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,434
It's just Cindy. She's sleepwalking.
No, wait. We need this.

866
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,359
Why do we need pictures of Cindy?

867
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,834
She didn't trigger it.

868
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,311
What do you mean she didn't trigger it?
Somebody's with her.

869
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,630
Who?

870
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:28,914
Cindy!

871
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,915
Cindy!

872
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,080
Cindy!

873
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,879
Hey, over here. It's safe.

874
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,918
There's someone else in there with her.

875
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,410
I'm hearing another voice. Here, listen.

876
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,516
Follow me. This way.

877
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,798
This is where I hide.

878
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,189
Cindy?

879
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,040
Cindy?

880
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,030
Where'd she go, Ed?

881
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,033
Windows are locked.

882
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,037
Ed, where'd she go?

883
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:22,914
Brad, get the UV light.

884
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:25,231
The what?
Just ask Drew.

885
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:28,659
Drew, I need a UV light.

886
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:31,334
Here, that's it. Go, go, go, go!

887
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:38,914
Turn off the light.

888
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,119
Get out of the way.

889
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:48,396
Okay.

890
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,194
Hit the lights!

891
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,760
Found her.

892
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,436
Here we go.

893
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,271
All right. You got her?
Yeah.

894
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,038
That's where Rory hides when he's afraid.

895
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,753
Hon? Could I have April's
music box, please?

896
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:27,560
How's Cindy?
She doesn't remember a thing.

897
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:31,840
Here you go.

898
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:33,875
Thank you.

899
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:12,874
Lorraine!

900
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,189
No.

901
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,309
Lorraine!

902
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,789
Lorraine!

903
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,360
Lorraine!

904
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:41,760
Lorraine!

905
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:35,640
She made me do it.

906
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:39,280
She made me do it.

907
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,600
She made me do it.

908
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:48,356
Ed!

909
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,358
Come on! Lorraine!

910
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,316
Ed!

911
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,873
Ed, I know what she did.

912
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:04,640
I got you. I know. It's okay.
I know what she did.

913
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,713
I know what she did. She possessed
the mother to kill the child.

914
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,394
She visits Carolyn every night.

915
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:12,394
That's what the bruise marks are!
She's feeding off of her!

916
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:28,754
Nancy?

917
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:34,469
Nancy!

918
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,155
Are you okay?

919
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,080
Nancy!

920
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,636
Grab her!

921
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:44,719
Daddy! Help!

922
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,670
Nancy!

923
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:54,990
Is she okay?

924
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:56,395
It's okay, I got you.

925
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,596
Did you get that?

926
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,075
Yeah.

927
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:07,233
I'll have the footage developed
and get it over to Father Gordon.

928
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:11,394
He's our liaison at the church.
I imagine we'll get a pretty fast response.

929
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:13,597
Listen, Roger?
Yeah?

930
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,852
Listen, when we get the exorcist,
I'll be back. But Lorraine...

931
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,132
Yeah, I understand.

932
01:21:18,557 --> 01:21:20,116
Until then Drew's gonna
keep an eye on you.

933
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:22,516
Hey, Ed, thank you for everything.
Yeah.

934
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:25,435
Mommy?

935
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,399
That's everything.

936
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:42,674
Mommy?

937
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,116
Judy?

938
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:03,794
Oh, God!

939
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,076
Judy?

940
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,372
Lorraine! Wait!

941
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,794
Lorraine. What?

942
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:20,314
Mom, it's me. Is Judy okay?

943
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,949
What?
Can you go check, please?

944
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,193
Damn it, Mom, just check, please!

945
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,086
Are you gonna tell me what's going on?

946
01:22:27,511 --> 01:22:28,219
It's Judy.

947
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,874
What? What do you mean? What?

948
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:31,996
What?

949
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,511
Oh, thank God.

950
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,170
Mom, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you.

951
01:22:38,195 --> 01:22:39,582
I'll explain later, okay?

952
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,320
What the hell happened?

953
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:45,951
I had a vision of Judy in the water.

954
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:48,396
I know it was some kind of warning.

955
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,120
I know it.

956
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,509
Okay.

957
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:55,880
Let's get out of here.

958
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:46,349
So?
Yeah, well, you weren't kidding.

959
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:47,590
No.

960
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:52,553
Look, Ed, this is complicated
because the kids aren't baptized.

961
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:55,952
No, I understand.
And the family are not members of the church.

962
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:57,440
Oh, come on.
And...

963
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:01,751
The approval would have to come
directly from the Vatican.

964
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:06,033
Father, we've never seen nothing like this.

965
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,640
Yeah, well, neither have I.

966
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,238
Father, they don't have a lot of time.

967
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,069
All right.

968
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,153
I'll push it through myself.

969
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,277
Thank you, Father. Thank you.
Thank you.

970
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,375
All right, we'll wait for your call.

971
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:33,577
Yeah.

972
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:39,711
Mommy? Daddy?

973
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:58,560
Mommy?

974
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:00,400
Daddy?

975
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,394
Dad?

976
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,354
Nanna?

977
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,000
Nanna?

978
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:41,534
Nanna!

979
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:44,839
Nanna, help! Nanna, help!

980
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,036
Judy?

981
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:47,458
Nanna!

982
01:27:47,782 --> 01:27:48,782
Nanna!

983
01:27:49,406 --> 01:27:50,406
Nanna!

984
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,315
Help!

985
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:54,353
Judy!
Nanna!

986
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,358
Judy, open the door!
Mom!

987
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:00,152
Ed, there's something wrong.

988
01:28:00,276 --> 01:28:01,276
What?

989
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:04,630
Nanna!

990
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:06,873
Judy!
Help!

991
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,191
Judy! Judy, open this door!
What is it?

992
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:12,478
What's wrong with her? Judy!
Hey, move. Move, move, move, move.

993
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:14,473
Judy, get back, honey.
Get back!

994
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,154
Come on!
Hurry.

995
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,792
Help! Help!

996
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,079
Get away from the door, Judy!

997
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:27,793
Oh, God! Are you okay?

998
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:32,034
There was someone rocking
in the chair with Annabelle.

999
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,236
What?

1000
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:40,709
It's okay.

1001
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:02,074
She's still in the case.

1002
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:05,916
It's okay.

1003
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:08,759
It's okay. It's okay.

1004
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:16,670
Dad! Dad!
Daddy!

1005
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:19,759
Dad! Dad!
Mom just left with Christine and April.

1006
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:22,099
She, she went in the car and drove away.
Daddy!

1007
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:24,215
Daddy, she smells like rotting meat.
She didn't say what was going on.

1008
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:25,594
She just left.
What do you mean, she left?

1009
01:29:25,619 --> 01:29:27,600
Left where?
Gone, I don't know where she was going.

1010
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:35,359
Where are we going, Mom?

1011
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:45,235
Hello?
It's Roger.

1012
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:46,959
Something's going on with Carolyn.

1013
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:49,959
Andrea was here and said Carolyn
took off with Christine and April.

1014
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:51,714
The girls said she smelled like rotten meat.

1015
01:29:51,738 --> 01:29:53,908
Possesses the mother to kill the child,
that's what she does.

1016
01:29:53,932 --> 01:29:55,358
She's taking them to the house.

1017
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,632
Roger, get back to the house now.
I'll meet you there.

1018
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:59,575
Lock the door, close the blinds.

1019
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,261
Stay off the phone!

1020
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,400
Go.

1021
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,919
I'm coming with you.
No way, you stay with Judy.

1022
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:13,479
The only way to protect Judy is
if we stop this where it started.

1023
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:16,498
Otherwise, she'll latch onto us again.
That's exactly why I am going.

1024
01:30:16,522 --> 01:30:18,795
You think I'm gonna let
you walk into this alone?

1025
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:21,400
I can't lose you.

1026
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,229
You won't.

1027
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,073
Let's finish this together.

1028
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:47,094
It's locked.
Carolyn!

1029
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:49,196
Roger!

1030
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:50,476
Get out of the way!

1031
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:58,359
Roger!
Ed!

1032
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,113
Carolyn!
Ed!

1033
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:02,555
Carolyn!
We're down here!

1034
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:05,554
Carolyn, don't!
No, no! She's got...!

1035
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,837
Get her hand!
Get the scissors!

1036
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:22,036
We gotta get her to the car!
And bring her where?

1037
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:23,797
To take her to the priest for the exorcism.

1038
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:25,854
Hey! Where's April?
April?

1039
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:28,795
April!

1040
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:31,676
Take Christine to the car and find April!

1041
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:32,916
April!

1042
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:35,155
Come on!

1043
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:47,751
She won't let her leave the house.
What do you mean?

1044
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,610
If we take her out, the witch will kill her.

1045
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:59,674
Roger!

1046
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:00,994
Carolyn!

1047
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:02,596
Go!

1048
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:03,830
Carolyn?

1049
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:11,431
Okay, I'm gonna put you in here.
Come on.

1050
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,240
Get in. Stay in here.
I don't wanna stay here by myself.

1051
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:15,898
Stay in here no matter what.
I'll be back.

1052
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:18,395
I have to find April, okay?
I'll be back, I promise.

1053
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:22,910
April?

1054
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:27,109
You okay?

1055
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:33,269
Stop!

1056
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:38,831
Brad! Brad!

1057
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:54,472
Let's get something to tie her up!

1058
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,434
Hold it.

1059
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:16,914
I gotta call Father Gordon.
We gotta get him out here.

1060
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:19,436
He's too far away.
She won't make it. Look at her.

1061
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:32,515
Then you need to leave.
What are you talking about?

1062
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:34,797
I have to do it. The exorcism.

1063
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:38,193
What? I thought you said we
need a priest. You're not a priest.

1064
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:39,946
Well, you got a better idea?

1065
01:33:40,271 --> 01:33:41,259
He can do it.

1066
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:42,788
You can do it.

1067
01:33:43,013 --> 01:33:44,240
But you gotta get out of here.

1068
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:45,280
I'm not leaving you!

1069
01:33:45,304 --> 01:33:47,500
Damn it Lorraine, I'm not doing
this with you in here!

1070
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:52,952
God brought us together for a reason.
This is it.

1071
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,459
I'm gonna get the book.

1072
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:13,514
April!

1073
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:23,554
April!

1074
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:49,110
In the name of the Father,
the Son, the Holy Spirit.

1075
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:29,950
April!

1076
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:31,951
Hold her still! Hold her still!

1077
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:33,873
Come here! Hold her still!

1078
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:43,949
April?

1079
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:51,876
April!

1080
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:53,599
April, you under there?

1081
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,070
April!

1082
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:04,713
Carolyn. Carolyn. Don't give in!
Don't let her take you!

1083
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:06,957
Ed! You gotta stop, you're killing her.
Stop!

1084
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:08,474
No, he can't!

1085
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:13,320
Roger, help me!

1086
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:20,232
Ed! Goddamn it, stop it!

1087
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,835
Understand this!
We are now fighting for her soul!

1088
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,232
In the name of Jesus Christ,
the saints and all the angels...

1089
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:28,511
I command you to reveal yourself!

1090
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:00,480
Roger, help me!

1091
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:53,120
Put her down!

1092
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,275
Put her down!

1093
01:38:57,480 --> 01:38:58,550
Put her down!

1094
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:01,635
Carolyn!

1095
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:03,155
Carolyn!

1096
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:07,991
Ed, look out!

1097
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:12,954
Are you okay?

1098
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:16,917
Hold her still! Don't let her up!

1099
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:18,480
We're losing her, Roger!

1100
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:21,195
Damn you! You leave my family alone,
you hear me?

1101
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:24,000
I don't know what you are, but you leave
my wife alone, goddamn it!

1102
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:27,153
Let her go!
Do you hear me? Let her go!

1103
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:31,950
Let her go, goddamn it!
Let her go!

1104
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:40,471
She's already gone.

1105
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:43,317
And now you're all gonna die.

1106
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:51,870
April!

1107
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:55,920
I found her! She's under the house!
Under the kitchen!

1108
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:58,510
Don't! No!

1109
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,680
Get her!

1110
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:16,514
Here.
Carolyn!

1111
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:21,397
Carolyn!
She's in that hole. Right there.

1112
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,117
Carolyn? Oh, my God. No!

1113
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:29,000
Can't go in. Can't reach.

1114
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:30,669
No! Carolyn, don't!

1115
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:34,400
Carolyn, no!

1116
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:36,558
Bathsheba!

1117
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:42,960
By the power of God,
I condemn you back to hell!

1118
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,920
This is your daughter!

1119
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:50,654
You can't give in!

1120
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:54,551
Roger. We need to get her
to fight from the inside.

1121
01:40:54,575 --> 01:40:56,280
Don't let her do this.
She still get strong.

1122
01:40:56,304 --> 01:40:57,905
Don't let this thing do this.
You gotta fight it.

1123
01:40:57,930 --> 01:40:59,739
You're stronger than she is.

1124
01:40:59,740 --> 01:41:01,418
You gotta fight it!
Keep it going, Roger!

1125
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:03,934
You gotta stay with us, all right?
Come on back, Carolyn.

1126
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,280
You're in, that's it! Get her back!

1127
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:09,080
Remember what you showed me.
No!

1128
01:41:11,700 --> 01:41:13,969
Remember that day that you said
you would never forget.

1129
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:25,556
You said they meant the world to you.

1130
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:28,316
This is what you'll be leaving behind.

1131
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:08,475
Mommy?

1132
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:43,200
It's over.

1133
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:45,273
I am so sorry.

1134
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:47,586
I love you so much.

1135
01:42:47,711 --> 01:42:49,358
I love you so much.

1136
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:50,960
I love you so much.

1137
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:53,913
I'm so happy.

1138
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:17,599
A draft do that to your face?

1139
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,571
I'd take a guy with a gun any day.

1140
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:26,194
You did good.

1141
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:28,040
No, you did.

1142
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:31,798
I'll call Father Gordon
and let him know what happened.

1143
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:34,079
Sounds good.

1144
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:02,115
The Vatican approved the exorcism.

1145
01:45:03,140 --> 01:45:04,332
Nice timing.

1146
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:09,716
And if we can, then he'd like
to meet with us tomorrow.

1147
01:45:09,980 --> 01:45:12,395
There's a case in Long Island
he'd like to discuss.

1148
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:13,630
Really?
