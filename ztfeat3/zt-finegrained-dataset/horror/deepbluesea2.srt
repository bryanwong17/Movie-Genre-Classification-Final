1
00:00:52,106 --> 00:00:54,874
Blacktip on the line.

2
00:00:56,544 --> 00:00:58,011
She's a fighter, <i>ek se.</i>

3
00:00:58,013 --> 00:00:59,878
That's what I like
to hear, brah.

4
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,082
Come, bru. Come my bru, help.

5
00:01:02,084 --> 00:01:04,250
Help me, my bru.

6
00:01:06,454 --> 00:01:07,922
Come on...

7
00:01:13,394 --> 00:01:15,029
Yes.

8
00:01:15,996 --> 00:01:18,063
Come on.

9
00:01:18,065 --> 00:01:19,932
- Come on.
- Oh, yeah.

10
00:01:19,934 --> 00:01:21,068
Yeah.

11
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,869
Ah, get the hook.

12
00:01:22,871 --> 00:01:25,472
There it is. Get the hook.
I'm holding there.

13
00:01:25,474 --> 00:01:28,109
The hook.

14
00:01:30,445 --> 00:01:33,011
- Ha, ha. 'Kay.
- I'm holding.

15
00:01:33,013 --> 00:01:35,181
Come on, get that fin, my bru.

16
00:01:35,183 --> 00:01:36,818
Get it!

17
00:01:41,055 --> 00:01:42,288
Yes, yes.

18
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,589
Away!

19
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:47,360
- Away!
- Ha-ha-ha!

20
00:01:47,362 --> 00:01:49,062
- Wow!
- Woo!

21
00:01:50,165 --> 00:01:51,733
All right.

22
00:01:54,401 --> 00:01:57,169
Woo!

23
00:01:57,171 --> 00:01:58,804
- Yeah...
- Woo!

24
00:01:58,806 --> 00:02:00,642
You're a killer, my bru.

25
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:05,145
Ha!

26
00:02:05,147 --> 00:02:06,312
Come take a selfie.

27
00:02:06,314 --> 00:02:09,118
- Take a selfie.
- Woo. Woo!

28
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,140
Happy.

29
00:02:34,142 --> 00:02:37,143
<i>Attention all mariners.
Attention all mariners.</i>

30
00:02:37,145 --> 00:02:40,012
<i>Any vessel in or around
zone one-seven-nine.</i>

31
00:02:40,014 --> 00:02:42,516
<i>I say again, zone
one-seven-nine.</i>

32
00:02:42,518 --> 00:02:44,687
<i>You are advised to
leave the area.</i>

33
00:02:45,853 --> 00:02:47,255
What's this bullshit, eh?

34
00:02:53,227 --> 00:02:55,962
<i>If you can see orange
smoke on your horizon,</i>

35
00:02:55,964 --> 00:02:57,698
<i>you are in danger. I say again,</i>

36
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,601
<i>if you can see orange smoke,
you are in immediate danger.</i>

37
00:03:01,603 --> 00:03:04,403
<i>Depart for coastal
waters at once.</i>

38
00:03:04,405 --> 00:03:07,339
Um...

39
00:03:07,341 --> 00:03:08,742
Ah, Ru...?

40
00:03:12,947 --> 00:03:15,380
Think we should pull
the lines, my bru?

41
00:03:15,382 --> 00:03:17,016
Are you crazy? Kwame...

42
00:03:17,018 --> 00:03:18,917
they're really
biting today, brah.

43
00:03:21,023 --> 00:03:23,222
I don't wanna go to jail, man.

44
00:03:23,224 --> 00:03:25,158
Besides...

45
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,795
I'm pretty kussed from
that last fight, man.

46
00:03:28,797 --> 00:03:31,130
Don't be a pussy.

47
00:03:31,132 --> 00:03:33,599
Radio didn't say nothing
about the coast guard.

48
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:35,669
All we know, it's some...

49
00:03:35,671 --> 00:03:38,004
longliner out here, greedy.

50
00:03:38,006 --> 00:03:40,940
We... me and you...
we're going nowhere.

51
00:03:40,942 --> 00:03:43,610
We're gonna fish now, my friend.

52
00:03:43,612 --> 00:03:45,645
Let's fish.

53
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,151
What was that?

54
00:04:02,096 --> 00:04:06,832
- Hey, come, come. You all right?
- Fuck.

55
00:04:08,837 --> 00:04:10,803
That's a big one, <i>ek se.</i>

56
00:04:10,805 --> 00:04:12,605
And that's why we're
out here, baby.

57
00:04:12,607 --> 00:04:14,343
That's solid gold!

58
00:04:21,983 --> 00:04:23,319
Look...

59
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,717
Are you seeing this?

60
00:04:34,163 --> 00:04:36,428
Have you seen sharks
swim like that?

61
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,063
What are they doing?

62
00:04:38,065 --> 00:04:41,603
They're serving themselves up on a platter.
That's what.

63
00:05:07,462 --> 00:05:08,661
Kwame!

64
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,433
Fuck.

65
00:05:15,404 --> 00:05:16,671
Kwame!

66
00:06:02,384 --> 00:06:04,086
Hello?

67
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:29,489
I can't believe he
didn't eat you.

68
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:32,290
Well, luckily I wouldn't
taste very good to him.

69
00:09:32,292 --> 00:09:35,160
You know the idea that
great whites are these

70
00:09:35,162 --> 00:09:37,496
malicious killing machines
roving the shorelines

71
00:09:37,498 --> 00:09:39,298
looking for some
swimmer to chomp on

72
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,900
is just pure fiction
perpetuated by Hollywood.

73
00:09:41,902 --> 00:09:47,941
I mean, these magnificent and
unfairly represented creatures

74
00:09:47,943 --> 00:09:50,043
are simply looking for fish.

75
00:09:50,045 --> 00:09:52,044
Or a nice, fat seal to eat.

76
00:09:52,046 --> 00:09:54,413
You know, any time there
is a human attack,

77
00:09:54,415 --> 00:09:56,948
it's just a case of
mistaken identity.

78
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:00,285
Sharks are an extremely
important part

79
00:10:00,287 --> 00:10:01,888
of our ocean's ecosystem.

80
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:05,390
And, sadly, they
are being killed

81
00:10:05,392 --> 00:10:10,163
at an average rate of
100 million per year.

82
00:10:10,165 --> 00:10:13,502
For a purpose as frivolous
as a bowl of fin soup.

83
00:10:15,603 --> 00:10:19,672
That is why the institute
my mother founded,

84
00:10:19,674 --> 00:10:24,409
Five Oceans Institute, is fully
dedicated to shark research

85
00:10:24,411 --> 00:10:27,212
and to educating the public
on how important it is

86
00:10:27,214 --> 00:10:29,283
to protect the species.

87
00:10:30,551 --> 00:10:32,018
Yeah.

88
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,453
Your video shows you swimming
with a wide variety of sharks.

89
00:10:35,455 --> 00:10:38,259
Is there any type of shark
you wouldn't swim with?

90
00:10:40,395 --> 00:10:41,626
Bull sharks.

91
00:10:41,628 --> 00:10:45,231
They're the most lethal
of all the shark species.

92
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:48,233
They tend to blast their
prey with the thick part

93
00:10:48,235 --> 00:10:49,669
of their skull to disable them,

94
00:10:49,671 --> 00:10:52,770
and then, uh, clamp
down like a pit bull.

95
00:10:52,772 --> 00:10:56,275
And their bite is 10 times
that of a great white, so,

96
00:10:56,277 --> 00:10:58,711
yeah, they're quite
intimidating to swim with.

97
00:11:10,123 --> 00:11:11,557
Aaron, you on comms?

98
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:14,393
Roger, Trent. I got eyes on you.

99
00:11:14,395 --> 00:11:17,265
Open fence section 5F.

100
00:11:39,421 --> 00:11:42,221
You come back with an expression
like that on your face,

101
00:11:42,223 --> 00:11:43,923
I know there's a
story behind it.

102
00:11:43,925 --> 00:11:45,794
Yeah, not one I wanna spread.

103
00:11:47,061 --> 00:11:48,528
We had a jail break today.

104
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,129
How many?

105
00:11:50,131 --> 00:11:51,362
All five.

106
00:11:51,364 --> 00:11:52,999
That's five too many, man.

107
00:11:53,001 --> 00:11:55,366
Yeah, no shit.

108
00:11:55,368 --> 00:11:58,136
I gotta check the
perimeter fence.

109
00:11:58,138 --> 00:12:00,541
Those fish can't get out again.

110
00:12:09,617 --> 00:12:12,784
Lastly, I'd like to thank
you for having me.

111
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:15,623
Thank you.

112
00:12:26,935 --> 00:12:28,433
Dr. Calhoun.

113
00:12:28,435 --> 00:12:29,400
Yes?

114
00:12:29,402 --> 00:12:31,437
Misty, my name is Craig Burns.

115
00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:33,474
Hi, what can I do for you?

116
00:12:36,344 --> 00:12:40,178
Durant Pharmaceuticals.
I'm not a pharma doc.

117
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,581
What am I missing?

118
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,649
My client, Mr. Durant,
is a fan of your work.

119
00:12:43,651 --> 00:12:45,518
He considers you the
most astute expert

120
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,519
in shark behavior in the world.

121
00:12:47,521 --> 00:12:50,121
He'd like you to consult
on a new project of his.

122
00:12:50,123 --> 00:12:51,558
A conservation project?

123
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,161
He prefers to call it the
preservation of man.

124
00:12:55,464 --> 00:12:57,362
So you continued
your mother's work?

125
00:12:57,364 --> 00:12:59,631
She was the one that taught
you to love the ocean?

126
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:02,168
She taught me to respect it.

127
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,636
You're not filling in all
the blanks, Mr. Burns.

128
00:13:04,638 --> 00:13:07,707
Why is a pharma company
interested in working with me?

129
00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:10,909
Mr. Durant would love the chance
to answer your questions.

130
00:13:10,911 --> 00:13:12,712
When?

131
00:13:12,714 --> 00:13:14,349
Tomorrow.

132
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:18,583
Fifty thousand dollars?

133
00:13:18,585 --> 00:13:21,319
- For what?
- To share your expertise.

134
00:13:21,321 --> 00:13:23,555
That's yours, Dr. Calhoun,
whether you decide

135
00:13:23,557 --> 00:13:25,890
to work with us or not.
Call it a down payment.

136
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:28,059
But should you choose
to come on board,

137
00:13:28,061 --> 00:13:29,595
Mr. Durant is prepared
to fully fund

138
00:13:29,597 --> 00:13:32,264
your work at the Five Oceans
for the next five years.

139
00:13:32,266 --> 00:13:33,731
And from what I've
read recently,

140
00:13:33,733 --> 00:13:35,534
your institute could
use the money.

141
00:13:35,536 --> 00:13:38,672
Something about a grant
withdrawal, if I recall?

142
00:13:42,076 --> 00:13:45,613
Aren't you even a little curious
about what we're doing?

143
00:14:16,176 --> 00:14:17,778
Aaron.

144
00:14:20,614 --> 00:14:22,515
What's the most
important rule here?

145
00:14:22,517 --> 00:14:27,622
Don't piss into the wind and
don't pull on Superman's cape.

146
00:14:30,324 --> 00:14:32,391
Yeah. No, no,
that's-that's the second

147
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:34,026
most important rule, of course.

148
00:14:34,028 --> 00:14:38,499
The first most important rule is
always keep the fences green.

149
00:14:41,102 --> 00:14:42,635
Which they are, dude.

150
00:14:42,637 --> 00:14:45,170
They were green this morning,
they'll be green tonight.

151
00:14:45,172 --> 00:14:46,505
I don't sleep on my job.

152
00:14:46,507 --> 00:14:48,506
Then how do you explain

153
00:14:48,508 --> 00:14:51,845
five sharks going for
a goddamn joy swim?

154
00:14:53,915 --> 00:14:56,818
Hey, man, look, that's...
That's not possible.

155
00:14:57,852 --> 00:14:59,751
I swear, look.

156
00:14:59,753 --> 00:15:01,520
You see?

157
00:15:01,522 --> 00:15:03,956
System's working perfectly,
just like I programmed.

158
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,358
Yeah, and I'm telling you,
those sharks were out

159
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,927
in the open ocean.

160
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:10,062
I don't get... Jesus!

161
00:15:10,064 --> 00:15:11,797
You see?

162
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:15,768
They avoid that electrical
field like the plague.

163
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,809
Wait a minute.

164
00:15:23,276 --> 00:15:25,412
What the hell?

165
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,280
What is that?

166
00:15:29,282 --> 00:15:30,685
A tunnel?

167
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:34,086
That's a tunnel under the cable!

168
00:15:34,088 --> 00:15:36,024
Sharks can't do that.

169
00:15:38,191 --> 00:15:39,594
Can they?

170
00:15:41,228 --> 00:15:43,162
We gotta extend the
fence's range.

171
00:15:43,164 --> 00:15:47,098
It'll take us a week to get
more cable down from Cape Town.

172
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,568
We don't have that much time.

173
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,337
Should I notify the boss?

174
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:53,808
No. No, not yet.

175
00:15:55,142 --> 00:15:57,012
I got an idea.

176
00:16:25,305 --> 00:16:27,840
You have gotta be kidding me.

177
00:16:27,842 --> 00:16:29,274
Misty.

178
00:16:29,276 --> 00:16:31,410
This is Daniel and Leslie Kim.

179
00:16:31,412 --> 00:16:35,481
Daniel is a neurophysiologist.
Leslie is a neurobiologist.

180
00:16:35,483 --> 00:16:37,949
Leslie, Daniel, meet Dr.
Misty Calhoun.

181
00:16:37,951 --> 00:16:39,985
Misty is a marine
conservationist

182
00:16:39,987 --> 00:16:42,520
who has singlehandedly
removed three shark species

183
00:16:42,522 --> 00:16:44,656
- from the endangered list.
- Wow.

184
00:16:44,658 --> 00:16:47,360
So a neurophysiologist,
a neurobiologist,

185
00:16:47,362 --> 00:16:51,429
and a shark conservationist
enter a bar.

186
00:16:51,431 --> 00:16:52,930
What's the punchline?

187
00:16:52,932 --> 00:16:55,500
No punchline, just an
international murderer's row

188
00:16:55,502 --> 00:16:57,101
of brilliant minds.

189
00:16:57,103 --> 00:16:59,571
If you'll excuse me, I need
to talk to the captain.

190
00:16:59,573 --> 00:17:02,510
We should arrive at the
complex by 1500 hours.

191
00:17:04,612 --> 00:17:06,044
Did you guys sign this NDA?

192
00:17:06,046 --> 00:17:08,479
I got a headache just
trying to get through it.

193
00:17:08,481 --> 00:17:10,149
Oh, good, so it's not just me.

194
00:17:10,151 --> 00:17:12,484
It's some lawyer trying
to justify his job.

195
00:17:12,486 --> 00:17:14,387
But you did sign it?

196
00:17:14,389 --> 00:17:17,422
Oh, yeah, we've been waiting
for this opportunity.

197
00:17:17,424 --> 00:17:20,322
You act like we already
know it's great.

198
00:17:20,324 --> 00:17:20,825
It's a big if, Daniel.

199
00:17:20,827 --> 00:17:22,328
But it's Carl Durant.

200
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:25,331
I mean, the guy's made of
money, and he gets things done.

201
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,300
And after this weekend,
funding won't be something

202
00:17:28,302 --> 00:17:30,069
we need to worry about anymore.

203
00:17:30,071 --> 00:17:32,170
Yeah, he is throwing
his money around.

204
00:17:32,172 --> 00:17:35,440
We're newlyweds, so
don't mind the PDA.

205
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:37,342
Sorry.

206
00:17:37,344 --> 00:17:39,143
It is crazy to pack
an overnight bag,

207
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:41,612
and head out to sea not
knowing what we're in for.

208
00:17:41,614 --> 00:17:43,448
Yeah, I did a little
research myself,

209
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,883
but nothing's really adding up.

210
00:17:44,885 --> 00:17:47,453
I'm baffled as to why I'm here.

211
00:17:47,455 --> 00:17:50,658
Well, I guess we'll all
find out together, then.

212
00:19:08,268 --> 00:19:11,169
This is it? Here you go.

213
00:19:11,171 --> 00:19:12,806
- Thank you.
- Of course.

214
00:19:14,842 --> 00:19:17,845
- Watch your step.
- Thank you.

215
00:19:24,184 --> 00:19:25,686
Mike.

216
00:19:26,553 --> 00:19:28,320
Welcome to Akheilos.

217
00:19:28,322 --> 00:19:30,422
You mean Akheilos?

218
00:19:30,424 --> 00:19:32,826
As in the child Zeus
turned into a shark?

219
00:19:33,628 --> 00:19:34,826
That's the one.

220
00:19:34,828 --> 00:19:36,930
Please, follow me.

221
00:20:04,391 --> 00:20:06,524
Okay, power it up.

222
00:20:31,885 --> 00:20:33,819
Mike, recharge the battery.

223
00:20:33,821 --> 00:20:35,924
I need to lay down
another set of rings.

224
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,461
I think you need a new DPV.

225
00:20:43,463 --> 00:20:45,330
Gets the job done.

226
00:20:45,332 --> 00:20:48,266
I see you've met our head of
operations, Trent Slater.

227
00:20:48,268 --> 00:20:49,935
Trent,

228
00:20:49,937 --> 00:20:52,206
this is Dr. Misty Calhoun.

229
00:20:53,373 --> 00:20:56,140
You mind if I ask
what those are for?

230
00:20:56,142 --> 00:20:58,509
We're reinforcing the
fence perimeter.

231
00:20:58,511 --> 00:21:01,080
This entire complex is
surrounded by those rings?

232
00:21:01,082 --> 00:21:03,649
No, we're surrounded
by electrical cable

233
00:21:03,651 --> 00:21:05,050
that runs along the sea floor.

234
00:21:05,052 --> 00:21:06,817
These rings are
coated in graphite,

235
00:21:06,819 --> 00:21:08,719
an excellent conductor
of electricity,

236
00:21:08,721 --> 00:21:10,021
as I'm sure you're aware.

237
00:21:10,023 --> 00:21:11,689
We're using these
rings to extend

238
00:21:11,691 --> 00:21:13,792
the range of the electric field.

239
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:17,428
Just an extra bit of insurance.

240
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:20,200
What exactly are you
guys trying to keep out?

241
00:21:21,602 --> 00:21:23,271
It's what we're
trying to keep in.

242
00:21:28,275 --> 00:21:30,842
Those are bull sharks.

243
00:21:30,844 --> 00:21:33,445
What are you doing with
bull sharks in containment?

244
00:21:33,447 --> 00:21:35,080
Welcome, welcome.

245
00:21:35,082 --> 00:21:37,182
I see you've met
our test subjects.

246
00:21:37,184 --> 00:21:39,083
How many do you have?

247
00:21:39,085 --> 00:21:43,455
Five, including Bella. I'm
Carl Durant, you must be...?

248
00:21:43,457 --> 00:21:45,024
Uninterested in small talk.

249
00:21:45,026 --> 00:21:47,759
You mind explaining to me what
it is you're doing with...

250
00:21:49,063 --> 00:21:50,728
what is it, you
referred to them as?

251
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,863
Your test subjects?

252
00:21:51,865 --> 00:21:53,532
Very important test subjects.

253
00:21:53,534 --> 00:21:55,367
You know, sharks
aren't lab mice.

254
00:21:57,203 --> 00:21:58,803
I love your passion.

255
00:21:58,805 --> 00:22:02,239
Yeah, but do you mind, I'd like
to finish the introductions.

256
00:22:02,241 --> 00:22:04,243
Yeah, I'm Misty.

257
00:22:04,245 --> 00:22:05,878
Well, hello.

258
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,714
That's Dr. Daniel Kim and Dr.
Leslie Kim.

259
00:22:09,716 --> 00:22:11,984
Daniel, Leslie, Carl Durant.

260
00:22:11,986 --> 00:22:13,784
Now everyone knows everyone.

261
00:22:13,786 --> 00:22:16,787
What you may not know is that

262
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:18,957
those are a disaster
waiting to happen

263
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:21,025
I'm sorry, when I
asked you here,

264
00:22:21,027 --> 00:22:23,328
you must have assumed I
was working with sharks.

265
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:27,166
Well, I never make assumptions,
but working with bull sharks is

266
00:22:27,168 --> 00:22:28,233
a bad idea.

267
00:22:28,235 --> 00:22:30,435
Yes. They are

268
00:22:30,437 --> 00:22:33,671
a bit more dangerous than
traditional lab rats,

269
00:22:33,673 --> 00:22:35,840
but no one is gonna
get hurt out here.

270
00:22:35,842 --> 00:22:38,143
You can't guarantee that.

271
00:22:38,145 --> 00:22:40,845
Actually, I can.

272
00:22:40,847 --> 00:22:43,916
Would you all please
follow me topside?

273
00:22:43,918 --> 00:22:46,821
I have something I'd
like to show you.

274
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,224
You really busted his chops.

275
00:22:52,226 --> 00:22:53,758
I was just telling the truth.

276
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,393
Yeah, well, don't stop.

277
00:22:55,395 --> 00:22:58,031
We could use some more
of it around here.

278
00:23:13,146 --> 00:23:14,946
Well, the floor is
yours, young man.

279
00:23:14,948 --> 00:23:16,348
Well, as Mr. Durant said,

280
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:19,584
we have an extensive
safety protocol, which...

281
00:23:22,322 --> 00:23:23,688
Seriously?

282
00:23:25,692 --> 00:23:28,493
- Swim, dude!
- Somebody do something!

283
00:23:30,663 --> 00:23:32,266
Hang on, dude!

284
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:35,335
Whoa!

285
00:23:36,437 --> 00:23:37,601
Oh, my God.

286
00:23:37,603 --> 00:23:38,938
Oh, my God, I don't see him.

287
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,241
- I don't see him!
- Where'd he go?

288
00:23:43,276 --> 00:23:45,709
Are you guys not going
to do anything?

289
00:23:45,711 --> 00:23:47,044
Do you guys see this?

290
00:23:47,046 --> 00:23:49,851
Hey, stay calm! Stay calm!

291
00:23:56,055 --> 00:23:57,989
Oh, my God.

292
00:23:57,991 --> 00:24:00,258
Oh, my gosh.

293
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,926
Help's on the way!

294
00:24:01,928 --> 00:24:03,094
Be quick!

295
00:24:03,096 --> 00:24:04,830
- Oh, my God.
- Are you okay?

296
00:24:04,832 --> 00:24:08,333
This is not what I call okay!
Oh, God!

297
00:24:08,335 --> 00:24:11,101
You can make it! Oh, my gosh!

298
00:24:11,103 --> 00:24:12,938
- Swim faster!
- Oh, my God.

299
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,105
Five more seconds.

300
00:24:14,107 --> 00:24:15,876
- Don't look back!
- Come on!

301
00:24:17,378 --> 00:24:19,143
Come on, you guys.

302
00:24:19,145 --> 00:24:20,778
Come on.

303
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,515
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my gosh.

304
00:24:23,517 --> 00:24:25,583
Come on, you're almost there.

305
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,990
- Come on, guys.
- You can make it!

306
00:24:35,228 --> 00:24:38,565
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

307
00:24:40,601 --> 00:24:41,800
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

308
00:24:41,802 --> 00:24:43,168
Better get a raise for that.

309
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:46,036
Sorry, Aaron. I have a
flair for the dramatic,

310
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:47,339
but you were perfectly safe.

311
00:24:47,341 --> 00:24:48,907
Did you think that was funny?

312
00:24:48,909 --> 00:24:51,409
I think it was an
effective demonstration.

313
00:24:51,411 --> 00:24:54,545
You're condition training bull sharks.
That's impossible.

314
00:24:54,547 --> 00:24:57,082
Impossible? Really?

315
00:24:57,084 --> 00:24:59,253
After what you just saw?

316
00:25:00,554 --> 00:25:02,955
How did you teach them
to swim in a formation?

317
00:25:02,957 --> 00:25:05,090
I'll explain everything
later, but first,

318
00:25:05,092 --> 00:25:07,592
please put on some dry
clothes, settle in,

319
00:25:07,594 --> 00:25:10,498
and we'll reconvene in
the wet lab in an hour.

320
00:25:15,969 --> 00:25:17,936
You could get incited for this.

321
00:25:17,938 --> 00:25:19,671
Relax, I'll talk to him.
Come on...

322
00:25:19,673 --> 00:25:21,174
Relax?

323
00:25:22,942 --> 00:25:25,078
One of your sharks bit my foot.

324
00:25:25,912 --> 00:25:27,379
You're imagining things.

325
00:25:27,381 --> 00:25:29,180
Look at my fricking shoe, dude.

326
00:25:29,182 --> 00:25:31,316
He has playing with me, like...

327
00:25:31,318 --> 00:25:33,017
He was toying with
me or something.

328
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,687
Sharks don't play jokes, Aaron.

329
00:25:35,689 --> 00:25:39,557
You and I both know these
aren't normal sharks.

330
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:43,160
Well, it's a good thing they
don't like the taste of nerds.

331
00:25:43,162 --> 00:25:44,595
Ha.

332
00:25:44,597 --> 00:25:47,931
FYI, this nerd keeps this
whole place running.

333
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,161
Come in.

334
00:28:38,205 --> 00:28:40,307
We have a problem.

335
00:28:43,343 --> 00:28:44,842
Wh-what's the problem?

336
00:28:44,844 --> 00:28:46,812
Sharks got out this morning.

337
00:28:46,814 --> 00:28:48,280
What?

338
00:28:48,282 --> 00:28:51,082
Apparently, they dug a tunnel
under the electric fence.

339
00:28:51,084 --> 00:28:52,450
There was an accident.

340
00:28:52,452 --> 00:28:54,821
Trent thinks they may have
killed some fishermen.

341
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,555
He thinks.

342
00:28:58,557 --> 00:29:00,190
He thinks.

343
00:29:00,192 --> 00:29:01,826
Meaning he didn't see it.

344
00:29:01,828 --> 00:29:04,731
He was concerned enough
to mention it to me.

345
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,202
Okay.

346
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:13,971
So the sharks burrowed a tunnel

347
00:29:13,973 --> 00:29:15,273
under the electric fence,

348
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:17,508
and then they followed
Trent back here.

349
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,509
Yeah?

350
00:29:18,511 --> 00:29:19,846
Exactly.

351
00:29:21,247 --> 00:29:23,648
And do you know why?

352
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,416
Because they're problem solving.

353
00:29:25,418 --> 00:29:27,386
They're learning how to learn,

354
00:29:27,388 --> 00:29:29,553
and they like it.

355
00:29:29,555 --> 00:29:32,890
Which means the
drugs are working.

356
00:29:32,892 --> 00:29:36,093
Each day, their genetic
structure evolves.

357
00:29:36,095 --> 00:29:39,630
My sharks are getting smarter.

358
00:29:39,632 --> 00:29:41,632
If it gets out those
sharks hurt someone,

359
00:29:41,634 --> 00:29:43,168
the liability will be enormous.

360
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,969
There's no coming back
from that kind of PR...

361
00:29:44,971 --> 00:29:47,537
The sharks are alive because
I allow them to be.

362
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:49,073
Plain and simple.
I created them.

363
00:29:49,075 --> 00:29:52,444
And once my research is
completed, I will end them.

364
00:29:52,446 --> 00:29:55,179
What the f... What
does that mean?

365
00:29:55,181 --> 00:29:57,682
They have trackers
imbedded in their fins.

366
00:29:57,684 --> 00:30:00,084
We can always find them,
whether they're here,

367
00:30:00,086 --> 00:30:01,419
or out in the deep blue sea.

368
00:30:01,421 --> 00:30:04,354
And once my experiment is over,

369
00:30:04,356 --> 00:30:06,691
I will simply kill them.

370
00:30:06,693 --> 00:30:10,530
All of them. So don't worry
about the liability.

371
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:15,301
There will be no evidence.

372
00:31:07,254 --> 00:31:09,754
How can you be hungry right now?

373
00:31:09,756 --> 00:31:13,158
Tsk. You know I eat
when I'm excited.

374
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,026
So you aren't having
second thoughts?

375
00:31:15,028 --> 00:31:17,062
After Durant's stunt out there?

376
00:31:17,064 --> 00:31:19,697
Yeah, he's... eccentric.

377
00:31:19,699 --> 00:31:22,700
But his money's still good.

378
00:31:22,702 --> 00:31:24,305
If you say so.

379
00:31:25,404 --> 00:31:27,974
Hey. Look at me.

380
00:31:29,308 --> 00:31:31,678
Babe, look at me.

381
00:31:34,581 --> 00:31:39,453
Look, we won't regret this.
I promise. Okay?

382
00:31:42,689 --> 00:31:47,059
But, um... There is something
I need to tell you.

383
00:31:47,061 --> 00:31:50,094
You're gonna find
out soon anyway.

384
00:31:50,096 --> 00:31:51,630
What is it?

385
00:31:51,632 --> 00:31:53,465
Ahem.

386
00:31:53,467 --> 00:31:54,865
I've been working with Durant

387
00:31:54,867 --> 00:31:57,301
on the design of his
delivery molecules,

388
00:31:57,303 --> 00:31:58,669
making them smaller,

389
00:31:58,671 --> 00:32:01,706
so they effect DNA
structure more quickly.

390
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:05,411
And... I also gave him
access to some of your work.

391
00:32:06,412 --> 00:32:08,446
I can't believe this.

392
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,714
How long?

393
00:32:09,716 --> 00:32:10,948
Seven months.

394
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:13,317
You've been lying to
me for seven months?

395
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:15,953
No, not lying. Just
leaving something out.

396
00:32:15,955 --> 00:32:17,322
Why would you do that?

397
00:32:17,324 --> 00:32:18,823
I thought we were partners.

398
00:32:18,825 --> 00:32:20,224
We are partners.

399
00:32:20,226 --> 00:32:21,592
But I knew you'd be hesitant,

400
00:32:21,594 --> 00:32:23,461
because of Durant's
shady reputation.

401
00:32:23,463 --> 00:32:25,263
So you just decided
to go around me?

402
00:32:25,265 --> 00:32:26,796
Just to check it out.

403
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:29,668
I mean, if this goes the way I
think it will, we'll be rich.

404
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:32,370
I did not get into
science to get rich.

405
00:32:32,372 --> 00:32:36,040
Yeah, but with money we
can achieve so much more.

406
00:32:36,042 --> 00:32:39,613
No more groveling and
having to beg for grants.

407
00:32:43,216 --> 00:32:48,853
Look... You say the word,
and we can leave right now.

408
00:32:48,855 --> 00:32:50,690
I mean it.

409
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:56,326
We're already out here.
I guess...

410
00:32:56,328 --> 00:32:58,463
I'm sorry.

411
00:32:58,465 --> 00:33:01,632
Don't ever do that again
to me, Daniel, I mean it.

412
00:33:01,634 --> 00:33:03,567
I need to trust you.

413
00:33:03,569 --> 00:33:06,571
I promise. All right?
We're a team.

414
00:33:06,573 --> 00:33:08,441
No more secrets.

415
00:33:34,401 --> 00:33:36,301
Please just stop
complaining about it.

416
00:33:36,303 --> 00:33:37,802
- It wasn't cool, man.
- You're fine.

417
00:33:37,804 --> 00:33:39,406
It wasn't cool.

418
00:33:40,373 --> 00:33:41,872
Welcome!

419
00:33:41,874 --> 00:33:43,940
Welcome, please come in.

420
00:33:43,942 --> 00:33:48,278
Now, I'm sure you're all curious
as to why I asked you here.

421
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,383
Not everybody.

422
00:33:52,285 --> 00:33:54,252
So you finally told her.

423
00:33:54,254 --> 00:33:56,220
Ah. Yes.

424
00:33:56,222 --> 00:33:58,022
Good for you.

425
00:33:58,024 --> 00:34:01,459
Well, I've asked you here
because I need your help.

426
00:34:01,461 --> 00:34:04,364
I've reached a critical
phase in my research.

427
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:08,033
Leslie, if I may
call you, Leslie,

428
00:34:08,035 --> 00:34:11,301
you and your husband study
traumatic brain injury?

429
00:34:11,303 --> 00:34:13,270
Among other things.

430
00:34:13,272 --> 00:34:15,005
And that includes smart drugs?

431
00:34:15,007 --> 00:34:16,440
Nootropics.

432
00:34:16,442 --> 00:34:19,476
My company is one of
the leading producers

433
00:34:19,478 --> 00:34:21,779
of biopharma drugs, including...

434
00:34:21,781 --> 00:34:24,082
Performance enhancers.

435
00:34:24,084 --> 00:34:27,951
You've been sanctioned by the
World Anti-Doping Agency.

436
00:34:27,953 --> 00:34:32,623
In this case, intelligence
enhancers, Nootropics.

437
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:35,259
You're talking about
drugs like Adderall?

438
00:34:35,261 --> 00:34:38,129
Well Nootropics can
improve memory access,

439
00:34:38,131 --> 00:34:41,933
increase concentration, even
speed up your decision making.

440
00:34:41,935 --> 00:34:43,567
So basically just stimulants?

441
00:34:43,569 --> 00:34:44,768
That's right.

442
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:47,408
Nothing can increase
native intelligence.

443
00:34:48,207 --> 00:34:49,607
Until now.

444
00:34:49,609 --> 00:34:53,277
You see, I've
developed compounds

445
00:34:53,279 --> 00:34:58,082
that can actually alter the
genetic structure of the brain.

446
00:34:58,084 --> 00:34:59,250
Speeding up evolution

447
00:34:59,252 --> 00:35:02,319
in the direction of
greater intelligence.

448
00:35:02,321 --> 00:35:03,554
Much greater.

449
00:35:03,556 --> 00:35:06,723
And we deliver these compounds,

450
00:35:06,725 --> 00:35:10,629
using targeted antibodies.

451
00:35:10,631 --> 00:35:12,466
From sharks.

452
00:35:13,634 --> 00:35:15,669
You're testing these
drugs on sharks?

453
00:35:16,803 --> 00:35:19,473
That's absolutely inhumane.

454
00:35:20,806 --> 00:35:24,408
It's not inhumane at all.
Let me show you.

455
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:26,377
- Aaron.
- Trent,

456
00:35:26,379 --> 00:35:27,948
we're ready for Bella.

457
00:35:57,877 --> 00:35:59,611
All right, she's out.

458
00:35:59,613 --> 00:36:01,645
They got her.

459
00:36:32,446 --> 00:36:34,078
Easy, easy, easy.

460
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,082
All right.

461
00:36:36,348 --> 00:36:37,848
Mike, you got her?

462
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:39,884
Aren't you scared,
being that close?

463
00:36:39,886 --> 00:36:41,889
Nah. Sharks don't worry me.

464
00:36:48,627 --> 00:36:50,527
Vitals are online.

465
00:36:50,529 --> 00:36:53,864
BP 34 over 68.

466
00:36:53,866 --> 00:36:56,967
Heart rate 42 bpm.

467
00:36:56,969 --> 00:37:00,471
Respiration rate and
oxygen levels steady.

468
00:37:00,473 --> 00:37:02,373
She's looking good.

469
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:08,312
As you can see, our treatment of
our sharks is totally painless.

470
00:37:08,314 --> 00:37:11,915
If we bind a drug on
a molecular level

471
00:37:11,917 --> 00:37:13,618
to the shark's antibodies,

472
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,120
we can then mainline that drug

473
00:37:16,122 --> 00:37:18,355
to whatever area of
the brain we want.

474
00:37:18,357 --> 00:37:21,759
We've already increased
Bella's base intelligence

475
00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:23,226
by a thousand-fold.

476
00:37:23,228 --> 00:37:24,895
And you actually
think you can get

477
00:37:24,897 --> 00:37:26,563
the same results
in human beings?

478
00:37:26,565 --> 00:37:30,234
I think it's an
absolute necessity

479
00:37:30,236 --> 00:37:34,775
if we want to maintain the
supremacy of mankind.

480
00:37:36,741 --> 00:37:41,913
Artificial intelligence is
becoming stronger every year.

481
00:37:41,915 --> 00:37:44,248
Soon, quantum
computing will begin

482
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:47,652
an exponential acceleration
of the ability

483
00:37:47,654 --> 00:37:50,888
of our computers to
teach themselves.

484
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:54,591
And when that happens, we'll
lose control of them,

485
00:37:54,593 --> 00:37:57,997
and our world, in an instant.

486
00:38:00,632 --> 00:38:02,703
Man himself...

487
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:06,206
will become obsolete.

488
00:38:07,707 --> 00:38:12,379
And they will... destroy us.

489
00:38:14,781 --> 00:38:17,348
But there's another way.

490
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:22,719
The human brain has a
hundred billion neurons.

491
00:38:22,721 --> 00:38:26,390
Our potential is greater
than any machine.

492
00:38:26,392 --> 00:38:29,326
It just needs to be...

493
00:38:29,328 --> 00:38:31,060
unleashed.

494
00:38:31,062 --> 00:38:34,133
So you're the savior of
the entire human race?

495
00:38:35,535 --> 00:38:37,404
I think you've got
a God complex.

496
00:38:39,504 --> 00:38:43,007
When I'm successful,

497
00:38:43,009 --> 00:38:45,779
we can all be gods.

498
00:38:46,846 --> 00:38:48,381
Or monsters.

499
00:38:58,957 --> 00:39:01,225
You realize that it was
much of your research

500
00:39:01,227 --> 00:39:03,560
that helped lead me in
the proper direction

501
00:39:03,562 --> 00:39:04,797
in the first place?

502
00:39:15,442 --> 00:39:18,241
Is your boss always
such a piece of work?

503
00:39:18,243 --> 00:39:21,245
He just started taking
the new drugs himself.

504
00:39:21,247 --> 00:39:23,313
They seem to kinda hop him up.

505
00:39:23,315 --> 00:39:25,016
It's not exactly a secret.

506
00:39:25,018 --> 00:39:28,419
He's administering the drugs to himself?
That's insane.

507
00:39:28,421 --> 00:39:31,755
Dude built a multi-billion
dollar empire out of nothing.

508
00:39:31,757 --> 00:39:34,125
And he's a scientific genius.

509
00:39:34,127 --> 00:39:36,697
Who am I to tell him what to do?

510
00:39:38,397 --> 00:39:39,466
Look, it happened.

511
00:39:41,134 --> 00:39:43,667
Have you noticed any negative
side effects on the sharks

512
00:39:43,669 --> 00:39:45,703
from these so-called
wonder-drugs?

513
00:39:45,705 --> 00:39:47,538
I wouldn't call them negative.

514
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,073
Her eyesight has improved.

515
00:39:49,075 --> 00:39:50,975
And she seems to be
able to communicate

516
00:39:50,977 --> 00:39:52,375
with the other bulls.

517
00:39:52,377 --> 00:39:55,314
- You're kidding?
- Nope, I'm not.

518
00:40:01,353 --> 00:40:03,754
So what's going on here?

519
00:40:24,511 --> 00:40:27,111
You know, I'm not really sure
why you brought me here.

520
00:40:27,113 --> 00:40:29,513
What exactly are you
expecting of me?

521
00:40:29,515 --> 00:40:33,083
Well Bella's been displaying
some unusual behaviors

522
00:40:33,085 --> 00:40:35,219
that don't seem to
be directly related

523
00:40:35,221 --> 00:40:37,855
to her increased intelligence.

524
00:40:37,857 --> 00:40:40,326
I was hoping that you
could tell us why.

525
00:40:42,428 --> 00:40:43,997
She's pregnant.

526
00:40:46,366 --> 00:40:48,199
What?

527
00:40:48,201 --> 00:40:51,601
That's impossible. I do blood
draws on her every week.

528
00:40:51,603 --> 00:40:53,237
We'd know if she was knocked-up.

529
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,875
Did you do an ultrasound?

530
00:40:56,843 --> 00:40:59,611
I've been swimming with sharks
since I was 7 years old.

531
00:40:59,613 --> 00:41:01,612
I know a knocked-up
shark when I see one.

532
00:41:01,614 --> 00:41:05,683
Why wouldn't this show up
on her hormone panels?

533
00:41:05,685 --> 00:41:07,484
You said your drugs

534
00:41:07,486 --> 00:41:09,152
alter her DNA.

535
00:41:09,154 --> 00:41:11,422
Maybe they do more to
her than you thought.

536
00:41:12,725 --> 00:41:14,361
- It's possible.
- Hey Trent?

537
00:41:23,569 --> 00:41:25,505
What the hell?

538
00:41:32,944 --> 00:41:34,547
You might be right.

539
00:41:35,948 --> 00:41:38,118
I should have seen this myself.

540
00:41:39,551 --> 00:41:42,454
Maybe you were too busy
patting yourself on the back.

541
00:41:44,556 --> 00:41:45,989
Possibly.

542
00:42:56,261 --> 00:42:58,830
The gen's been damaged. The
boat slammed up against it.

543
00:42:58,832 --> 00:43:01,366
And on top of that, there's
a couple hundred gallons

544
00:43:01,368 --> 00:43:03,636
- of fuel in the lagoon.
- What the hell, man?

545
00:43:12,078 --> 00:43:15,179
What happens if the fuel
hits the electric fence?

546
00:43:15,181 --> 00:43:18,582
We've got oxygen tanks stored
in the underwater bin.

547
00:43:18,584 --> 00:43:20,219
Yeah, I know.

548
00:43:40,973 --> 00:43:42,975
Gotta get a throat culture.

549
00:44:06,332 --> 00:44:07,897
Oh, shit!

550
00:44:20,446 --> 00:44:21,779
Jesus Christ!

551
00:44:21,781 --> 00:44:24,114
She was supposed to be
out for another hour!

552
00:44:24,116 --> 00:44:25,549
Is Bella all right?

553
00:44:25,551 --> 00:44:26,716
Yes, she's fine.

554
00:44:26,718 --> 00:44:28,453
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

555
00:44:28,455 --> 00:44:31,123
And I'm fine too,
thanks for asking!

556
00:44:35,995 --> 00:44:37,294
What was that?

557
00:44:41,834 --> 00:44:45,703
<i>"Mr. Durant has been displaying
increasingly erratic behavior,</i>

558
00:44:45,705 --> 00:44:48,438
<i>"and questionable judgment,
ever since he began</i>

559
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,241
<i>"his nootropic regimen.</i>

560
00:44:50,243 --> 00:44:52,509
<i>I have repeatedly
advised him against..."</i>

561
00:45:12,864 --> 00:45:14,464
Oh! What is it?

562
00:45:14,466 --> 00:45:18,201
Oh my G... What's going on?

563
00:45:18,203 --> 00:45:20,140
- What was that?
- I don't know.

564
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,839
Oh, my God.

565
00:45:22,841 --> 00:45:24,544
What the hell is happening?

566
00:45:28,814 --> 00:45:31,315
Does that mean the
fence is down?

567
00:45:31,317 --> 00:45:32,815
Yeah, only partly.

568
00:45:32,817 --> 00:45:34,850
- What do you mean only partly?
- I mean I can fix it!

569
00:45:34,852 --> 00:45:37,489
- Was that an explosion?
- This whole place is on fire.

570
00:45:38,556 --> 00:45:40,857
- Is that Bella?
- Yeah, she's the red one.

571
00:45:40,859 --> 00:45:43,661
Does... Does she normally
separate herself from...

572
00:45:43,663 --> 00:45:45,862
No, Dr. Calhoun, she does not!

573
00:45:59,611 --> 00:46:01,447
What the...

574
00:46:02,915 --> 00:46:04,216
Hello?

575
00:46:15,194 --> 00:46:16,659
Oh, shit...

576
00:46:16,661 --> 00:46:19,562
No, no, no! Come on, you
gotta be kidding me!

577
00:46:19,564 --> 00:46:21,165
She's taking out the cameras.

578
00:46:21,167 --> 00:46:22,498
She can do that?

579
00:46:36,181 --> 00:46:37,584
What the heck?

580
00:46:57,904 --> 00:47:00,170
Damn it! Hull integrity
has been breached!

581
00:47:00,172 --> 00:47:03,107
Release the pressure so we
don't lose the wet pool.

582
00:47:03,109 --> 00:47:04,310
You got it.

583
00:47:10,882 --> 00:47:12,618
This corridor is flooding!

584
00:47:13,986 --> 00:47:15,421
This is trouble.

585
00:47:23,928 --> 00:47:25,196
Aah!

586
00:47:25,198 --> 00:47:26,933
What is it?

587
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,708
Did you see that? Those
sharks tore Craig to pieces.

588
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:40,444
I've never seen a shark-bite
pattern like that before.

589
00:47:40,446 --> 00:47:42,312
We're all gonna die, aren't we?

590
00:47:42,314 --> 00:47:44,080
No, we're not.
Everybody calm down.

591
00:47:44,082 --> 00:47:45,549
Aaron. Aaron, what's our status?

592
00:47:45,551 --> 00:47:47,051
This is bad. This is really bad.

593
00:47:47,053 --> 00:47:50,087
Aaron! Hull status. Are
there multiple breaches?

594
00:47:50,089 --> 00:47:53,056
Only the eastern corridor...
so far.

595
00:47:53,058 --> 00:47:55,759
Don't say "so far." Why
would you say that?

596
00:47:55,761 --> 00:47:58,094
I've never seen
them act this way.

597
00:47:58,096 --> 00:47:59,797
They're in a frenzy.

598
00:47:59,799 --> 00:48:02,933
Can you please tell me a frenzy
isn't as bad as it sounds?

599
00:48:02,935 --> 00:48:05,136
It means they're in
serious hunting mode.

600
00:48:05,138 --> 00:48:06,937
This is so messed up.

601
00:48:06,939 --> 00:48:10,007
That's why they aren't leaving,
even though the fence is down...

602
00:48:10,009 --> 00:48:11,674
They're all staying to get us?

603
00:48:11,676 --> 00:48:14,877
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
This doesn't make sense.

604
00:48:14,879 --> 00:48:17,913
If all the sharks are
out in the lagoon,

605
00:48:17,915 --> 00:48:20,285
who did that to Craig?

606
00:48:26,359 --> 00:48:30,192
I know I told you not to backup
any of my research in the cloud,

607
00:48:30,194 --> 00:48:31,295
but now you have to.

608
00:48:31,297 --> 00:48:33,063
I can't.

609
00:48:33,065 --> 00:48:35,901
Even if I wanted to, whole
system's gone down.

610
00:48:37,636 --> 00:48:38,937
Oh, my God...

611
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,478
I figured it out.

612
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,015
Figured what out?

613
00:48:54,352 --> 00:48:55,621
What's happening?

614
00:48:57,957 --> 00:48:59,025
What is it? Spit it out.

615
00:49:00,393 --> 00:49:01,993
Bella isn't pregnant anymore.

616
00:49:01,995 --> 00:49:03,159
What?

617
00:49:03,161 --> 00:49:04,663
She had her babies.

618
00:49:06,064 --> 00:49:09,268
The drop into the wet pool
must have triggered labor.

619
00:49:11,169 --> 00:49:14,737
Whatever you crated here,
Durant, is vicious.

620
00:49:14,739 --> 00:49:17,973
These aren't your
typical sharks.

621
00:49:17,975 --> 00:49:21,712
They're just teeth and
muscle and killer instinct.

622
00:49:21,714 --> 00:49:24,882
It's the only thing that can
explain what happened to Craig.

623
00:49:24,884 --> 00:49:28,421
You're talking like they're
a bunch of super-piranha.

624
00:49:29,154 --> 00:49:30,790
They're worse.

625
00:49:32,058 --> 00:49:33,493
Much worse.

626
00:49:48,373 --> 00:49:50,507
- Look at me. Daniel.
- We can use this one...

627
00:49:50,509 --> 00:49:52,141
Daniel, look at me!

628
00:49:54,212 --> 00:49:56,716
Okay, breathe, baby. Breathe.

629
00:50:02,288 --> 00:50:04,791
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

630
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,460
We're gonna get through this.

631
00:50:09,462 --> 00:50:11,064
- We are.
- Yeah, okay.

632
00:50:13,198 --> 00:50:15,534
Come on. Come on.

633
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:24,741
Will you two please settle down.

634
00:50:24,743 --> 00:50:27,210
There's no benefit
to losing our heads.

635
00:50:27,212 --> 00:50:28,444
Aren't you the one who said

636
00:50:28,446 --> 00:50:30,714
your security system
is infallible?

637
00:50:30,716 --> 00:50:32,181
Yeah, it should've been.

638
00:50:32,183 --> 00:50:33,583
Obviously, my work has been

639
00:50:33,585 --> 00:50:35,618
even more successful
than I thought.

640
00:50:37,156 --> 00:50:39,859
If this is success, I'd
love to see failure.

641
00:50:41,393 --> 00:50:43,259
We need to get topside.

642
00:50:43,261 --> 00:50:44,795
I agree.

643
00:50:44,797 --> 00:50:46,962
There's just one problem.

644
00:50:46,964 --> 00:50:49,565
All the exits are underwater.

645
00:50:52,238 --> 00:50:54,904
Maybe they don't realize
there's a hole in the fence?

646
00:50:54,906 --> 00:50:56,774
They know it's there,
they created it.

647
00:50:56,776 --> 00:50:58,375
Why aren't they leaving? Misty?

648
00:50:58,377 --> 00:51:00,409
There's something
here they still want.

649
00:51:00,411 --> 00:51:02,480
Yeah, us.

650
00:51:02,482 --> 00:51:05,181
You wanna know why
chimps are so dangerous?

651
00:51:05,183 --> 00:51:07,650
Because they're smart
enough to hold a grudge!

652
00:51:07,652 --> 00:51:10,853
Just like humans! I
mean, that's it, right?

653
00:51:10,855 --> 00:51:13,957
It's gotta be. Bella's
not only smart,

654
00:51:13,959 --> 00:51:15,991
she's mean and she
wants us dead!

655
00:51:15,993 --> 00:51:19,129
The rest are her soldiers!
They'll do whatever she wants!

656
00:51:19,131 --> 00:51:21,098
We are screwed! We
are so screwed!

657
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,632
Okay. We don't have time
for theories or meltdowns.

658
00:51:23,634 --> 00:51:25,701
We gotta figure out a
way to get out of here.

659
00:51:25,703 --> 00:51:27,670
Is there a way to
make a phone call...

660
00:51:27,672 --> 00:51:30,040
- Like, a satellite phone?
- It only works topside.

661
00:51:30,042 --> 00:51:33,176
More of our fearless leader's
fanatical trade-secret bullshit

662
00:51:33,178 --> 00:51:36,179
that puts everyone else in
danger because he's nuts!

663
00:51:36,181 --> 00:51:38,714
- What did you say?
- I said, fuck you!

664
00:51:38,716 --> 00:51:41,984
What are you gonna do, huh?
Fire me? I quit!

665
00:51:41,986 --> 00:51:44,620
So how do we get out of
here if there's no exit?

666
00:51:44,622 --> 00:51:46,790
There is one other way.

667
00:51:46,792 --> 00:51:48,491
You thinking what I'm thinking?

668
00:51:48,493 --> 00:51:51,462
- Wet pool.
- Heh, heh! Wait, wait...

669
00:51:51,464 --> 00:51:53,330
You want us to swim out of here?

670
00:51:53,332 --> 00:51:55,966
No way in hell, dude. I'm
not getting in the water

671
00:51:55,968 --> 00:51:58,134
with those sharks again!
No! Uh-uh! End of.

672
00:51:58,136 --> 00:52:00,337
Yeah, no, Daniel and I
are not comfortable

673
00:52:00,339 --> 00:52:01,607
- with that either.
- No.

674
00:52:02,573 --> 00:52:04,540
You don't have to swim.

675
00:52:04,542 --> 00:52:06,878
So what? We teleport?

676
00:52:07,779 --> 00:52:09,913
Mike can ride the DPV

677
00:52:09,915 --> 00:52:11,047
to the main hub,

678
00:52:11,049 --> 00:52:14,851
call the Coast Guard
on the topside SAT.

679
00:52:14,853 --> 00:52:15,919
We get help.

680
00:52:15,921 --> 00:52:18,288
Yes, please, I'm a
big fan of help.

681
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:21,725
Yeah, maybe you forgot
about the baby sharks?

682
00:52:21,727 --> 00:52:23,127
A little important detail there.

683
00:52:23,129 --> 00:52:24,862
They must have come in
with the hull breach.

684
00:52:24,864 --> 00:52:26,763
They've found food in
here, so they'll probably

685
00:52:26,765 --> 00:52:29,766
stick around in here,
for a while at least.

686
00:52:29,768 --> 00:52:32,101
All right, it's a solid plan,

687
00:52:32,103 --> 00:52:33,370
only I'll go.

688
00:52:33,372 --> 00:52:35,371
No, you won't.
You're needed here.

689
00:52:35,373 --> 00:52:36,908
No, I'll go.

690
00:52:39,544 --> 00:52:41,245
- No way.
- I'm going.

691
00:52:41,247 --> 00:52:43,212
No. It's too dangerous
and this is my job.

692
00:52:43,214 --> 00:52:44,982
I'm going whether
you like it or not.

693
00:52:44,984 --> 00:52:47,083
- No need to risk your life.
- It's my life to risk.

694
00:52:47,085 --> 00:52:49,185
We can't afford to lose us all!

695
00:52:49,187 --> 00:52:52,522
Besides, I'm South African,
I live for this crazy shit!

696
00:52:52,524 --> 00:52:55,025
Those sharks can suck my ass!

697
00:52:55,027 --> 00:52:57,530
Mike, wait! Mike!

698
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:01,267
- Mike!
- Here we go!

699
00:53:05,738 --> 00:53:07,536
Does anybody see him?

700
00:53:07,538 --> 00:53:10,739
- Where'd he go?
- Does anybody see him?

701
00:53:10,741 --> 00:53:12,509
- Where is he?
- There he is.

702
00:53:12,511 --> 00:53:13,877
I see him.

703
00:53:13,879 --> 00:53:15,377
Do you think he's gonna make it?

704
00:53:15,379 --> 00:53:16,580
Yes.

705
00:53:16,582 --> 00:53:18,013
Oh, shit, there's a shark.

706
00:53:18,015 --> 00:53:20,552
- Mike!
- Mike, behind you!

707
00:53:23,855 --> 00:53:26,158
Oh, my God!

708
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:29,125
- Oh, no! Mike!
- Is he dead?

709
00:53:29,127 --> 00:53:31,127
- He's not moving.
- He's out.

710
00:53:31,129 --> 00:53:33,862
This is not happening.
This isn't happening!

711
00:53:33,864 --> 00:53:35,732
This isn't... This is....

712
00:53:39,303 --> 00:53:42,306
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

713
00:53:50,049 --> 00:53:51,651
Come on, Trent.

714
00:53:53,919 --> 00:53:57,286
- He's got him. He's got him.
- He's gonna be okay.

715
00:53:57,288 --> 00:54:00,792
He's coming to the wet pool,
he's coming to the wet pool!

716
00:54:03,129 --> 00:54:05,228
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

717
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:07,933
- Can't see them.
- Where are they?

718
00:54:09,701 --> 00:54:11,801
Pull them up! Pull them up!

719
00:54:21,513 --> 00:54:23,616
Give her room! Give her room.

720
00:54:35,727 --> 00:54:38,027
Come on, Mike! Come on, man.

721
00:54:38,029 --> 00:54:40,166
Come on, Mike!

722
00:54:44,502 --> 00:54:46,305
God damn it, come on!

723
00:54:50,009 --> 00:54:52,341
Come on!

724
00:54:53,745 --> 00:54:55,612
Got him! I got him! I got him!

725
00:54:55,614 --> 00:54:57,214
Got him!

726
00:55:00,585 --> 00:55:01,850
What happened?

727
00:55:01,852 --> 00:55:04,554
You got blindsided by a shark.

728
00:55:04,556 --> 00:55:06,022
You were dead, bro.

729
00:55:06,024 --> 00:55:08,793
I knew I should have gone
and watched your six.

730
00:55:09,895 --> 00:55:11,562
I told you...

731
00:55:11,564 --> 00:55:14,230
Those sharks can kiss my ass...

732
00:55:28,145 --> 00:55:30,781
Do we have any more weapons?

733
00:55:30,783 --> 00:55:33,183
Bang-sticks, spear-guns,

734
00:55:33,185 --> 00:55:34,250
strychnine nitrate?

735
00:55:34,252 --> 00:55:36,386
Okay, calm down.
Everybody calm down.

736
00:55:36,388 --> 00:55:38,455
I've got flares on the boat.
That's about it.

737
00:55:38,457 --> 00:55:40,656
You don't... You don't
mean this, all right?

738
00:55:40,658 --> 00:55:44,129
Now, you... You've spent your
entire life protecting sharks.

739
00:55:45,997 --> 00:55:47,730
I help people see

740
00:55:47,732 --> 00:55:49,766
that sharks aren't monsters.

741
00:55:49,768 --> 00:55:51,701
But your sharks?

742
00:55:51,703 --> 00:55:55,404
You've turned them
into monsters!

743
00:55:55,406 --> 00:55:58,341
We cannot let these sharks

744
00:55:58,343 --> 00:55:59,909
leave this complex!

745
00:55:59,911 --> 00:56:01,911
We cannot let them
keep breeding!

746
00:56:01,913 --> 00:56:05,281
We cannot let them
hurt any more people!

747
00:56:05,283 --> 00:56:07,917
We have to kill those
fucking sharks!

748
00:56:07,919 --> 00:56:09,719
All right, but you are ignoring

749
00:56:09,721 --> 00:56:11,620
the very valuable research

750
00:56:11,622 --> 00:56:12,922
that they are enabling.

751
00:56:12,924 --> 00:56:14,190
Listen, listen,

752
00:56:14,192 --> 00:56:17,426
I am so close to a breakthrough

753
00:56:17,428 --> 00:56:19,797
that will change the
course of history!

754
00:56:19,799 --> 00:56:22,900
Excuse me, but you might
wanna tell that to Mike.

755
00:56:22,902 --> 00:56:24,400
Oh, no, wait, you can't.

756
00:56:24,402 --> 00:56:27,703
You wanna know why? Because
a shark ate his head!

757
00:56:33,245 --> 00:56:35,411
We're losing pressure control.

758
00:56:35,413 --> 00:56:37,446
What does that mean?

759
00:56:37,448 --> 00:56:40,583
It means it's gonna blow!

760
00:57:06,477 --> 00:57:08,012
Leslie!

761
00:57:12,683 --> 00:57:15,118
Leslie!

762
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,256
Daniel!

763
00:57:18,189 --> 00:57:20,991
Push. Come on, come on!

764
00:57:20,993 --> 00:57:22,625
Come on!

765
00:57:22,627 --> 00:57:25,629
- There's too much water!
- Help me, don't give up on me!

766
00:57:25,631 --> 00:57:27,230
- I can't...
- Push!

767
00:57:27,232 --> 00:57:29,431
Right here.

768
00:57:29,433 --> 00:57:30,701
Ha! I got it!

769
00:57:30,703 --> 00:57:32,569
- Good!
- I got it! I got it!

770
00:57:32,571 --> 00:57:34,737
- You okay?
- Yeah. Are you?

771
00:57:34,739 --> 00:57:37,475
Yeah... Jesus.

772
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,279
Are the different
sections of this complex

773
00:57:44,281 --> 00:57:45,915
sealed away from each other?

774
00:57:45,917 --> 00:57:47,683
You wanna know if
the baby sharks

775
00:57:47,685 --> 00:57:49,185
are locked in the
Eastern Corridor.

776
00:57:49,187 --> 00:57:51,654
Yeah, it'd be nice if they were.

777
00:57:51,656 --> 00:57:53,022
No luck.

778
00:57:53,024 --> 00:57:54,757
They could be anywhere.

779
00:57:59,464 --> 00:58:02,799
How the hell did you end
up working for this guy?

780
00:58:02,801 --> 00:58:04,500
He's out of his mind.

781
00:58:04,502 --> 00:58:08,270
Yeah, only since he started
taking those drugs himself.

782
00:58:08,272 --> 00:58:11,473
He was an asshole before,
but not like this.

783
00:58:11,475 --> 00:58:14,279
I should have quit
this job months ago.

784
00:58:15,948 --> 00:58:17,482
So why are you still here?

785
00:58:19,283 --> 00:58:20,986
Why are <i>you</i> here?

786
00:58:36,968 --> 00:58:39,337
Do you know where we're going?

787
00:58:45,009 --> 00:58:47,145
Is there a way out?

788
00:58:48,846 --> 00:58:50,982
Let's hope it's not flooded.

789
00:58:52,149 --> 00:58:54,419
Yeah, let's hope.

790
00:59:18,777 --> 00:59:19,942
Leslie!

791
00:59:23,147 --> 00:59:24,614
"Come to Cape Town," they said.

792
00:59:24,616 --> 00:59:26,716
- "It'll be fun," they said!
- Keep it down.

793
00:59:26,718 --> 00:59:29,451
Remind me why we're going to
the crew's quarters again.

794
00:59:29,453 --> 00:59:31,554
It's the farthest thing away
from the eastern corridor.

795
00:59:31,556 --> 00:59:34,324
I get that, but shouldn't we
be looking for the others?

796
00:59:34,326 --> 00:59:36,225
Dude, Bella's babies
are on the prowl.

797
00:59:36,227 --> 00:59:38,194
We need to get out
of this water.

798
00:59:38,196 --> 00:59:40,830
I get that but my gut's saying
there's safety in numbers.

799
00:59:40,832 --> 00:59:43,933
Yeah? Well, my gut's telling
me we need to find a way out.

800
00:59:43,935 --> 00:59:46,169
Look, Aaron. Do not
make me do this alone.

801
00:59:46,171 --> 00:59:49,304
Please, man. Come on.

802
00:59:49,306 --> 00:59:51,875
All right, but you better
be right about this.

803
00:59:51,877 --> 00:59:53,344
This way.

804
01:00:07,524 --> 01:00:09,394
Leslie!

805
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:21,270
We're gonna be fine.

806
01:00:21,272 --> 01:00:23,339
How can you be so
optimistic right now?

807
01:00:23,341 --> 01:00:25,107
I'm clinging to hope, dude.

808
01:00:25,109 --> 01:00:27,844
It's a desperate cling, yeah,
but it's still a cling.

809
01:00:27,846 --> 01:00:31,815
There's the crew's quarters. I
think we'll be safe in there.

810
01:00:31,817 --> 01:00:33,283
I don't know, man, I still think

811
01:00:33,285 --> 01:00:35,152
we gotta be finding
a way out of here.

812
01:00:35,154 --> 01:00:36,553
Dude, we're walking fish food.

813
01:00:36,555 --> 01:00:38,321
We need to get away
from the sharks

814
01:00:38,323 --> 01:00:39,957
and just wait for help to come.

815
01:00:39,959 --> 01:00:41,857
Yeah, and what if it
doesn't come, Josh?

816
01:00:41,859 --> 01:00:44,027
So much for clinging to hope.

817
01:00:44,029 --> 01:00:45,527
By the way,

818
01:00:45,529 --> 01:00:48,897
if I ever ask you for a job
again, just ignore me.

819
01:00:48,899 --> 01:00:51,703
Dude, you were living
in your mom's basement.

820
01:00:53,004 --> 01:00:54,473
Come on.

821
01:02:06,611 --> 01:02:07,976
Hey!

822
01:02:07,978 --> 01:02:09,415
Where is everybody?

823
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:12,681
Haven't seen a soul.

824
01:02:12,683 --> 01:02:15,819
Everyone must have scattered
through different exits.

825
01:02:15,821 --> 01:02:17,853
You scared, Durant?

826
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,754
Be a fool not to be.

827
01:02:19,756 --> 01:02:22,424
Well, it ain't no fun when
the rabbit's got the gun.

828
01:02:22,426 --> 01:02:24,127
- Is it?
- How about we focus

829
01:02:24,129 --> 01:02:25,761
on getting out of here?

830
01:02:25,763 --> 01:02:27,496
How? We're sealed in.

831
01:02:27,498 --> 01:02:30,098
If we can make it to
the filtration room,

832
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:31,902
we should be able to climb out

833
01:02:31,904 --> 01:02:33,603
- through the air shaft.
- How?

834
01:02:33,605 --> 01:02:37,272
They put in access rungs
to facilitate maintenance.

835
01:02:37,274 --> 01:02:40,243
Oh, good, didn't
know about that.

836
01:02:40,245 --> 01:02:41,877
It's a good thing
I'm here, isn't it?

837
01:02:41,879 --> 01:02:44,380
- We need to find the others.
- I know...

838
01:02:44,382 --> 01:02:46,283
and we will, but we
gotta get topside

839
01:02:46,285 --> 01:02:48,784
and call for help first. If
there's another hull breach,

840
01:02:48,786 --> 01:02:51,288
this whole thing is
gonna be underwater.

841
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:53,656
Trent's right...

842
01:02:53,658 --> 01:02:57,594
Don't agree with me.
Makes me nervous.

843
01:02:57,596 --> 01:02:59,062
Is he right?

844
01:02:59,064 --> 01:03:00,763
I don't know.

845
01:03:00,765 --> 01:03:04,000
It's the best option we got.
Let's move.

846
01:03:10,975 --> 01:03:12,975
Leslie!

847
01:03:12,977 --> 01:03:15,213
Can you hear me?

848
01:03:20,518 --> 01:03:22,317
Leslie, where are you?

849
01:04:01,725 --> 01:04:04,262
The filtration room's this way.

850
01:05:05,522 --> 01:05:07,858
Let's get this door closed.

851
01:05:10,261 --> 01:05:11,661
Come on.

852
01:05:11,663 --> 01:05:13,395
God damn it, Aaron,

853
01:05:13,397 --> 01:05:15,498
I told you to get this
goddamned door fixed!

854
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,665
Yeah, Josh, it's not like

855
01:05:16,667 --> 01:05:19,268
I haven't been busy
the last 24 hours.

856
01:05:22,506 --> 01:05:24,475
Did you hear that?

857
01:05:29,714 --> 01:05:31,848
- Oh, God.
- Why did you say, "Oh, God?"

858
01:05:31,850 --> 01:05:34,283
- Get away from the door, Josh!
- Shit!

859
01:05:41,326 --> 01:05:43,292
Dude! Get out of there, man!

860
01:05:47,198 --> 01:05:49,799
Oh, you gotta be
freaking kidding me!

861
01:05:49,801 --> 01:05:52,601
Josh! Josh!

862
01:05:54,739 --> 01:05:56,875
This is so not how I wanna die.

863
01:06:19,163 --> 01:06:20,931
Oh, God...

864
01:06:25,402 --> 01:06:28,237
No! Aaron! Aaron!

865
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:29,804
No!

866
01:06:29,806 --> 01:06:33,042
- No! No!
- Josh?

867
01:06:33,044 --> 01:06:34,310
No...

868
01:06:34,312 --> 01:06:35,812
Josh?

869
01:06:43,989 --> 01:06:45,324
Josh!

870
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:51,330
Josh!

871
01:06:52,397 --> 01:06:54,032
Josh!

872
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:02,340
Josh!

873
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:11,179
Durant, when we get out of here,

874
01:07:11,181 --> 01:07:13,149
I'm gonna make sure
you're held responsible

875
01:07:13,151 --> 01:07:14,984
- for what you've done.
- Well, that's what I want, too,

876
01:07:14,986 --> 01:07:16,419
but they'll hear
about it from me.

877
01:07:16,421 --> 01:07:17,786
Don't forget, you signed an NDA!

878
01:07:17,788 --> 01:07:20,089
Oh, yeah, good luck finding it.
Or enforcing it.

879
01:07:20,091 --> 01:07:22,991
- Your legal counsel's dead.
- So, you wanna see us destroyed,

880
01:07:22,993 --> 01:07:26,196
all of mankind, so that you
can save what you value.

881
01:07:26,198 --> 01:07:29,198
See, we're not that different,
we just value different species.

882
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,433
Oh, we're about as different
as two people can be.

883
01:07:31,435 --> 01:07:33,268
Okay, okay. If you guys
don't stop arguing

884
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:35,740
I'm gonna feed myself
to these sharks. Okay?

885
01:07:43,381 --> 01:07:45,484
Leslie?

886
01:07:47,151 --> 01:07:48,650
Daniel?

887
01:07:48,652 --> 01:07:50,589
Leslie?

888
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:58,361
Daniel?

889
01:08:01,366 --> 01:08:03,132
Daniel!

890
01:08:03,134 --> 01:08:05,935
Inside this pump?

891
01:08:05,937 --> 01:08:07,538
Yes.

892
01:08:19,951 --> 01:08:21,819
Daniel!

893
01:08:41,706 --> 01:08:43,708
What are you doing?

894
01:08:46,111 --> 01:08:48,680
What the hell are you doing?
Are you crazy?

895
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:51,816
Have you lost your mind?

896
01:08:52,683 --> 01:08:54,685
Let's get out of here.

897
01:08:55,786 --> 01:08:57,686
You might have just killed her!

898
01:08:57,688 --> 01:09:00,459
Those baby sharks
won't get to us now.

899
01:09:01,492 --> 01:09:03,660
I should kill you right here.

900
01:09:03,662 --> 01:09:05,660
Yeah, but you won't.

901
01:09:05,662 --> 01:09:07,695
Because you're not a murderer.

902
01:09:07,697 --> 01:09:09,699
Besides, if we make it topside,

903
01:09:09,701 --> 01:09:11,968
maybe you can get help
in time to save her.

904
01:09:11,970 --> 01:09:14,003
Think of it as incentive.

905
01:09:14,005 --> 01:09:15,674
Ugh!

906
01:09:25,616 --> 01:09:28,183
It's... Ahh! It's jammed!

907
01:09:28,185 --> 01:09:30,020
Durant busted the door!

908
01:09:31,855 --> 01:09:34,089
Get topside! Call for help!

909
01:09:34,091 --> 01:09:35,725
I'm going up.

910
01:09:35,727 --> 01:09:39,360
Try to look for another way
out, but I'm coming back!

911
01:09:39,362 --> 01:09:41,297
I'm coming back down!

912
01:10:19,636 --> 01:10:21,639
Where are you going?

913
01:10:26,545 --> 01:10:28,576
You forgot where
your loyalties lie.

914
01:10:28,578 --> 01:10:29,915
Man, go to hell!

915
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:32,748
You know, I... I get her.

916
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:34,917
That woman's a fanatic.

917
01:10:34,919 --> 01:10:36,718
But you've been here,

918
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,619
you've watched what
we've achieved

919
01:10:38,621 --> 01:10:39,922
in such a short time.

920
01:10:39,924 --> 01:10:42,191
You've contributed to it!

921
01:10:42,193 --> 01:10:44,826
I've got the answer right here.

922
01:10:44,828 --> 01:10:48,397
We can access so much more

923
01:10:48,399 --> 01:10:50,432
of our brains' capabilities.

924
01:10:50,434 --> 01:10:52,168
I've done it, I've felt it!

925
01:10:52,170 --> 01:10:55,137
I just need a little
more time to figure out

926
01:10:55,139 --> 01:10:58,073
- how to make it last....
- Anything for the project, huh?

927
01:10:58,075 --> 01:11:00,743
You know, I had commanders
like you in the military!

928
01:11:00,745 --> 01:11:03,111
Soldiers were just
pieces on a chessboard.

929
01:11:03,113 --> 01:11:05,146
It's one of the reasons
I got the hell out.

930
01:11:05,148 --> 01:11:07,816
Well, you need to get back in,
because the war is coming!

931
01:11:07,818 --> 01:11:10,619
- There is no war!
- Man against machine!

932
01:11:10,621 --> 01:11:12,788
You are so paranoid
that machines,

933
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:14,789
robots, computers, are
gonna wipe us out!

934
01:11:14,791 --> 01:11:17,058
Let me tell you something,
from what I've seen,

935
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:19,360
man is the real threat,
man is the real problem!

936
01:11:19,362 --> 01:11:22,530
You know, you have really
lost your way, Trent.

937
01:11:22,532 --> 01:11:24,366
I'm disappointed in you.

938
01:11:24,368 --> 01:11:27,671
Then, it's a good thing I don't
give a damn what you think.

939
01:11:45,389 --> 01:11:46,825
Daniel!

940
01:11:50,294 --> 01:11:51,927
Where are you?

941
01:12:14,285 --> 01:12:15,819
Daniel?

942
01:12:34,505 --> 01:12:37,339
Leslie! Leslie!

943
01:12:37,341 --> 01:12:38,941
No! No, no, no!

944
01:12:38,943 --> 01:12:40,709
C'mon! Leslie...

945
01:12:40,711 --> 01:12:42,610
Leslie! No, no!
Don't go that way!

946
01:12:42,612 --> 01:12:46,748
No! No, don't! Come back! Come back!
Come back! No!

947
01:12:48,986 --> 01:12:51,186
C'mon, open this door!

948
01:12:53,123 --> 01:12:55,926
Leslie! It's me! Come here!

949
01:12:57,161 --> 01:12:58,860
Leslie, it's me! Come here!

950
01:12:58,862 --> 01:13:00,829
- Daniel?
- Leslie!

951
01:13:00,831 --> 01:13:03,198
Daniel!

952
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:07,002
Get out of the water!
Get out of there!

953
01:13:09,005 --> 01:13:12,040
- Get out of the water!
- Daniel! Daniel!

954
01:13:12,042 --> 01:13:13,875
- Daniel! Oh, my God!
- Run!

955
01:13:13,877 --> 01:13:15,645
Help me, Daniel!

956
01:13:17,848 --> 01:13:20,915
- Get off of her!
- Daniel, help me!

957
01:13:22,486 --> 01:13:24,119
Daniel, help! Daniel!

958
01:13:24,121 --> 01:13:25,553
Daniel!

959
01:13:33,197 --> 01:13:34,733
Leslie!

960
01:13:47,344 --> 01:13:49,514
No!

961
01:14:41,398 --> 01:14:42,466
Shit.

962
01:15:10,595 --> 01:15:11,863
Shit.

963
01:15:23,006 --> 01:15:24,973
Mayday, Mayday, Coast Guard.

964
01:15:24,975 --> 01:15:27,243
This is Research
Facility Akheilos.

965
01:15:27,245 --> 01:15:29,110
Requesting immediate evacuation.

966
01:15:29,112 --> 01:15:31,446
We are taking on water,
we are without power,

967
01:15:31,448 --> 01:15:32,580
and we are on fire.

968
01:15:32,582 --> 01:15:34,783
We've suffered major
structural damage.

969
01:15:34,785 --> 01:15:36,218
Requesting immediate evacuation.

970
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:38,686
I say again, requesting
immediate evac.

971
01:16:01,545 --> 01:16:04,512
You are rocking this whole
staying alive thing.

972
01:16:04,514 --> 01:16:06,450
Now get to that pipe...

973
01:16:10,054 --> 01:16:11,786
Oh no, no, no, no...

974
01:16:11,788 --> 01:16:13,254
Oh, come on!

975
01:16:13,256 --> 01:16:15,591
No! This is so not fair!

976
01:16:17,662 --> 01:16:19,727
Goddamn it!

977
01:16:19,729 --> 01:16:21,899
Whoa! Whoa!

978
01:16:35,912 --> 01:16:37,678
Daniel?

979
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:40,919
Leslie...

980
01:16:43,821 --> 01:16:46,655
I'm sorry, man, sincerely, I am,

981
01:16:46,657 --> 01:16:49,891
but right now, right now we
gotta keep moving, all right?

982
01:16:49,893 --> 01:16:51,328
Why?

983
01:16:53,063 --> 01:16:54,329
Just let me go.

984
01:16:54,331 --> 01:16:56,132
I'm not leaving you here.

985
01:16:56,134 --> 01:16:57,967
Just let me die.

986
01:16:57,969 --> 01:16:59,401
Snap out of it, Daniel!

987
01:16:59,403 --> 01:17:00,768
I can't do this on my own.

988
01:17:00,770 --> 01:17:03,472
Leslie wouldn't want you
to give up on her, huh?

989
01:17:03,474 --> 01:17:07,109
Why? She'd want you
to keep fighting.

990
01:17:07,111 --> 01:17:08,977
I know, I know I
barely knew her, man,

991
01:17:08,979 --> 01:17:11,879
but what I do know is
that she loved you.

992
01:17:11,881 --> 01:17:14,415
She'd want you to live.

993
01:17:14,417 --> 01:17:15,651
All right?

994
01:17:15,653 --> 01:17:17,485
So right now, what
you've got to do

995
01:17:17,487 --> 01:17:19,922
is you've got to live for her.

996
01:17:19,924 --> 01:17:21,656
You got to live for her.

997
01:17:21,658 --> 01:17:23,991
- I have to live for her.
- You got to live for her.

998
01:17:23,993 --> 01:17:25,526
You can do this.

999
01:17:26,563 --> 01:17:28,530
I can do this.

1000
01:17:28,532 --> 01:17:29,897
Yes, you can.

1001
01:17:29,899 --> 01:17:31,734
Come on.

1002
01:17:31,736 --> 01:17:33,071
Come on.

1003
01:17:45,550 --> 01:17:46,682
Misty?

1004
01:17:46,684 --> 01:17:49,750
- Oh, hey! Misty!
- Oh, my God! You're alive!

1005
01:17:49,752 --> 01:17:51,154
- Oh!
- You're alive!

1006
01:17:52,154 --> 01:17:53,558
Where are the others?

1007
01:17:55,791 --> 01:17:57,661
They didn't make it.

1008
01:18:01,197 --> 01:18:03,033
I'm so sorry.

1009
01:18:04,868 --> 01:18:06,267
I have to live for her.

1010
01:18:06,269 --> 01:18:07,869
Tell me you got a
way out of here.

1011
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:10,705
Yeah, there's an air shaft on
the other side of this door.

1012
01:18:10,707 --> 01:18:12,540
Trent's should be
topside right now,

1013
01:18:12,542 --> 01:18:14,609
- radioing for help.
- Thank God.

1014
01:18:14,611 --> 01:18:17,145
Well, what are we waiting for?
Come on, let's go.

1015
01:18:17,147 --> 01:18:18,579
Come on, help me with this door.

1016
01:18:18,581 --> 01:18:20,516
- All right.
- Pull! Pull!

1017
01:18:22,019 --> 01:18:25,053
Got it. All right,
stop, stop, stop.

1018
01:18:25,055 --> 01:18:26,687
What is it?

1019
01:18:26,689 --> 01:18:28,088
We're not alone.

1020
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:30,124
Go, go, go. Go!

1021
01:18:30,126 --> 01:18:31,226
Wait, what about you...

1022
01:18:31,228 --> 01:18:33,197
I'll be right behind you! Go!

1023
01:18:42,473 --> 01:18:43,774
Come on.

1024
01:18:53,417 --> 01:18:54,883
Shit!

1025
01:18:54,885 --> 01:18:56,754
Oh! Shit!

1026
01:19:02,392 --> 01:19:05,162
Guys, get out of here! Go!

1027
01:19:12,669 --> 01:19:14,002
Come on, Aaron.

1028
01:19:14,004 --> 01:19:15,904
Almost there.

1029
01:19:15,906 --> 01:19:17,338
One rung at a time.

1030
01:19:23,045 --> 01:19:24,514
Oh, shit.

1031
01:19:29,053 --> 01:19:31,122
One rung at a time!

1032
01:19:32,956 --> 01:19:34,890
Damn it. Ugh.

1033
01:19:34,892 --> 01:19:37,260
Hurry, the waters are rising!

1034
01:19:38,862 --> 01:19:40,161
All right!

1035
01:19:40,163 --> 01:19:41,732
Give me the key.

1036
01:19:43,899 --> 01:19:46,234
Give me the key.

1037
01:19:46,236 --> 01:19:48,770
What? No.

1038
01:19:48,772 --> 01:19:51,573
Give me the key.

1039
01:19:51,575 --> 01:19:52,908
No.

1040
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:55,776
My work's too important to
trust with a hothead like you.

1041
01:19:55,778 --> 01:19:58,079
Give me the goddamn
key, or I swear to God,

1042
01:19:58,081 --> 01:19:59,614
I will pry it from
your fingertips

1043
01:19:59,616 --> 01:20:01,586
and then throw you
to the sharks.

1044
01:20:04,121 --> 01:20:06,320
Oh, you feeling froggy?

1045
01:20:06,322 --> 01:20:08,459
Then jump.

1046
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:24,175
Here.

1047
01:20:25,108 --> 01:20:26,577
Come on!

1048
01:20:27,676 --> 01:20:29,811
I'm going back for the others.

1049
01:20:29,813 --> 01:20:31,446
Don't be a fool.

1050
01:20:31,448 --> 01:20:32,815
They're all dead.

1051
01:20:32,817 --> 01:20:34,816
- We're almost there!
- Aaron!

1052
01:20:34,818 --> 01:20:37,285
- Keep going!
- Aaron! I got you, I got you.

1053
01:20:37,287 --> 01:20:38,688
Come on!

1054
01:20:41,692 --> 01:20:42,723
Come on, come on.

1055
01:20:42,725 --> 01:20:45,160
- Trent!
- Come on! Come on, I got you.

1056
01:20:45,162 --> 01:20:46,494
Are there others?

1057
01:20:46,496 --> 01:20:48,630
Daniel, Daniel's in here.

1058
01:20:48,632 --> 01:20:50,535
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1059
01:20:56,072 --> 01:20:57,507
Fuck.

1060
01:20:59,443 --> 01:21:01,879
Dude, I led 'em on.

1061
01:21:07,451 --> 01:21:09,252
Shit, he's gone.

1062
01:22:00,304 --> 01:22:01,572
Look at this.

1063
01:22:07,309 --> 01:22:08,979
Holy shit, it's Misty.

1064
01:22:11,948 --> 01:22:13,283
Misty!

1065
01:22:15,118 --> 01:22:16,554
Misty, come on!

1066
01:22:18,154 --> 01:22:21,291
- Don't look back, come on!
- Misty, come on, swim!

1067
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,462
Come on, faster!

1068
01:22:27,096 --> 01:22:28,864
Misty, come on!

1069
01:22:28,866 --> 01:22:30,835
Come on. Come on.

1070
01:22:31,867 --> 01:22:34,337
All right, come on,
come on, come on.

1071
01:22:37,407 --> 01:22:39,874
- Why did you...?
- I went through the wet pool.

1072
01:22:43,947 --> 01:22:45,813
You left me down there to die!

1073
01:22:45,815 --> 01:22:47,816
I should throw you in
there, you asshole!

1074
01:22:47,818 --> 01:22:49,618
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Get off of me!

1075
01:22:49,620 --> 01:22:51,889
It's okay, there'll be
time for that later.

1076
01:23:00,096 --> 01:23:01,698
Aaron, where's Daniel?

1077
01:23:05,269 --> 01:23:06,871
He didn't make it.

1078
01:23:11,575 --> 01:23:13,240
You're the devil.

1079
01:23:13,242 --> 01:23:15,375
- I'm the devil?
- Yeah.

1080
01:23:15,377 --> 01:23:18,045
Copernicus, Galileo, Darwin.

1081
01:23:18,047 --> 01:23:21,549
At some point, all
scientific revolutionaries

1082
01:23:21,551 --> 01:23:22,883
were considered devils.

1083
01:23:22,885 --> 01:23:24,652
Heh, you're psychotic.

1084
01:23:24,654 --> 01:23:26,887
- Psychotic?
- Yeah, you're psychotic.

1085
01:23:26,889 --> 01:23:28,589
You just stay away from me.

1086
01:23:28,591 --> 01:23:30,625
Hey...

1087
01:23:30,627 --> 01:23:32,093
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Stay away!

1088
01:23:32,095 --> 01:23:33,095
Coast Guard!

1089
01:23:34,564 --> 01:23:37,399
They must have sent a drone
to see if my call was real.

1090
01:23:37,401 --> 01:23:39,066
- We're here!
- Hey!

1091
01:23:39,068 --> 01:23:41,535
- Hey! Hey, we're down here!
- Right here!

1092
01:23:41,537 --> 01:23:43,170
- Right here!
- Hey!

1093
01:23:43,172 --> 01:23:44,940
- Right here!
- We're down here!

1094
01:23:44,942 --> 01:23:46,077
- Here!
- Hey!

1095
01:23:51,648 --> 01:23:53,347
Why can't we catch a break?

1096
01:23:53,349 --> 01:23:54,615
Just one break!

1097
01:23:54,617 --> 01:23:55,950
Hell, I'd take half a break!

1098
01:23:55,952 --> 01:23:58,253
Oh, my God, my sharks
are incredible.

1099
01:23:58,255 --> 01:24:01,321
Yeah, maybe they'll put
that on your tombstone.

1100
01:24:04,794 --> 01:24:06,261
What the hell was that?

1101
01:24:06,263 --> 01:24:08,195
The dock structure's
starting to give.

1102
01:24:08,197 --> 01:24:09,530
And that means...?

1103
01:24:09,532 --> 01:24:12,366
It means that this dock
is gonna be in the water

1104
01:24:12,368 --> 01:24:13,634
in a couple of minutes.

1105
01:24:13,636 --> 01:24:15,503
We're dead.

1106
01:24:15,505 --> 01:24:16,973
We're dead.

1107
01:24:18,507 --> 01:24:21,409
No, we're not. Look.

1108
01:24:21,411 --> 01:24:23,277
We gotta swim for that boat.

1109
01:24:23,279 --> 01:24:26,781
There are still sharks in the
water, those odds aren't good.

1110
01:24:26,783 --> 01:24:28,584
Yeah, well, maybe
they finally left.

1111
01:24:28,586 --> 01:24:30,285
Maybe they're still
munching on the damn drone.

1112
01:24:30,287 --> 01:24:32,387
Absolutely not. We're waiting for
the Coast Guard to get here.

1113
01:24:32,389 --> 01:24:34,990
By the time the Coast Guard
gets here, we'll all be dead.

1114
01:24:36,393 --> 01:24:38,160
Christ.

1115
01:24:38,162 --> 01:24:40,293
- We don't have much time.
- He's right!

1116
01:24:40,295 --> 01:24:42,897
I am not getting in the water
with those sharks, forget it!

1117
01:24:42,899 --> 01:24:44,598
- You can do this.
- Oh, come on,

1118
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,133
there's gotta be another way.

1119
01:24:46,135 --> 01:24:48,136
Hey, if you got a better
idea, I'd love to hear it.

1120
01:24:48,138 --> 01:24:49,637
This is for your own good.

1121
01:24:49,639 --> 01:24:50,975
Whoa!

1122
01:24:52,408 --> 01:24:55,243
- It's satisfying, right?
- Shut up.

1123
01:24:55,245 --> 01:24:56,413
Okay, let's go.

1124
01:25:27,077 --> 01:25:28,509
Aaron!

1125
01:25:28,511 --> 01:25:30,046
Aaron!

1126
01:25:33,017 --> 01:25:34,684
Oh, no.

1127
01:26:00,042 --> 01:26:03,011
I told you I was Bella's master!

1128
01:26:37,647 --> 01:26:39,213
Where's Bella?

1129
01:26:39,215 --> 01:26:41,415
I don't see her.
I don't see her!

1130
01:26:41,417 --> 01:26:44,485
Where... Where is she? Fuck!

1131
01:26:44,487 --> 01:26:45,786
I shouldn't have

1132
01:26:45,788 --> 01:26:47,120
- pushed him in.
- Don't do that!

1133
01:26:47,122 --> 01:26:49,490
- What?
- You were trying to save him.

1134
01:26:49,492 --> 01:26:52,393
Oh, hey, she's back.

1135
01:26:52,395 --> 01:26:53,927
She's back!

1136
01:26:53,929 --> 01:26:56,633
Come on!

1137
01:26:57,835 --> 01:27:00,270
Trent, she's gonna
tear this boat apart.

1138
01:27:02,339 --> 01:27:03,640
Come on!

1139
01:27:32,669 --> 01:27:34,337
Damn straight.

1140
01:27:59,595 --> 01:28:01,396
Oh! I thought you were dead!

1141
01:28:03,166 --> 01:28:04,701
Yeah, so did I.

1142
01:28:06,068 --> 01:28:08,969
He had me down again, but
this time he just let me go.

1143
01:28:08,971 --> 01:28:11,271
And I used this thing to
hang near the bottom.

1144
01:28:11,273 --> 01:28:13,775
I told you they don't
like the taste of nerd.

1145
01:28:13,777 --> 01:28:16,343
Yeah, this one's got a
fetish for my shoes.

1146
01:28:16,345 --> 01:28:18,681
Come on, let's get out of here.

1147
01:28:29,192 --> 01:28:31,258
Wait, wait a sec. Wait.

1148
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:33,561
No. No, can't we just go home?

1149
01:28:33,563 --> 01:28:35,399
We can't let those
sharks survive.

1150
01:28:37,267 --> 01:28:38,402
Trent.

1151
01:28:41,504 --> 01:28:43,107
Hold on.

1152
01:28:48,612 --> 01:28:50,311
What's that?

1153
01:28:50,313 --> 01:28:52,246
Remember what Aaron said

1154
01:28:52,248 --> 01:28:54,682
about Durant being
ultra-paranoid

1155
01:28:54,684 --> 01:28:56,787
about protecting
his trade secrets?

1156
01:28:58,455 --> 01:28:59,890
It's true.

1157
01:29:09,433 --> 01:29:10,865
No frickin' way.

1158
01:29:10,867 --> 01:29:12,834
You gotta be kidding me.

1159
01:29:12,836 --> 01:29:14,972
I am not kidding.

1160
01:29:37,027 --> 01:29:39,793
Just like in the movies.

1161
01:29:39,795 --> 01:29:43,030
Yeah, just like in the movies.

1162
01:29:43,032 --> 01:29:45,201
My last job sucked.

1163
01:29:47,703 --> 01:29:50,370
They didn't try and eat me.

1164
01:29:50,372 --> 01:29:52,742
I'm moving back to
Silicon Valley.

1165
01:29:55,545 --> 01:29:56,777
All right,

1166
01:29:56,779 --> 01:29:58,881
let's get the hell out of here.

1167
01:30:22,371 --> 01:30:23,804
Come on, let's go.

1168
01:30:23,806 --> 01:30:25,408
I don't want to go out too deep.

1169
01:30:26,977 --> 01:30:28,843
What if there are
sharks out there?

1170
01:30:28,845 --> 01:30:31,779
There are no sharks at
this beach, I promise you.
