1
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,539
- Have a good night.
- Thanks.

2
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,799
Oh, come in.

3
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,595
Thank you so much for squeezing me in.

4
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:36,678
Oh, sure.

5
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,516
I'm so happy I found this spot.

6
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,352
- I just moved here.
- To New York?

7
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,897
No, to the Bronx.
I got priced out of my old neighborhood.

8
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,525
Oh, I hear you.
Same thing's been happening here.

9
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:52,612
You know, they offered me
a stupid amount of money for my salon.

10
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,489
- Agh.
- Yeah, so I took it.

11
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:00,245
Hey! Wow, that's great.

12
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,123
In fact, this is Becky's last mani ever.

13
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,752
This cuticle pusher's
about to go out of business… now.

14
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,299
This is the best manicure I've ever had.
Don't sell.

15
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,469
Good evening. Frank Polidori.

16
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,179
It's too late now.

17
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,598
We're finishing up
all the paperwork tonight.

18
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,601
- Come on, Frank. Let's go.
- Come on.

19
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,063
Now, right there.

20
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,358
Okay. And… great.

21
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,861
Now you got the money
for you and your husband,

22
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,070
- if you wanna...
- Aagh.

23
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,573
I'm not married, Frank.
I don't have a boyfriend either.

24
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,992
- I don't need no man to know my worth.
- Course not.

25
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,580
So, it's just you, then.

26
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,331
Yeah, it's just me.

27
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,430
Well, Becky,
let's get you on your way to the suburbs.

28
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,391
Yes!

29
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,853
You can come too if you want sometimes.
You can come visit.

30
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,229
Course I will.

31
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,940
- That's it?
- Mm-hm.

32
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,527
Yeah, I'm leaving for the suburbs!

33
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:01,783
Shoot it! Shoot it!

34
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,213
Hey, Lil Mayor!

35
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,969
Yo, Lil Mayor, what's up?

36
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,364
- Yo, what's up Carl? Nice to see you.
- What's poppin', kid?

37
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,428
- Coming to the block party?
- You know it!

38
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,189
What's up, Perez?

39
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,750
What's up, papi?

40
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,694
You know what's up!

41
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,777
What's poppin', y'all?
It's your girl Gloria, live,

42
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,447
on this beautiful 95-degree day,

43
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,592
but trust me, this ain't sweat.
This is glow. Get it.

44
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,677
Miguel!

45
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,012
Summer's almost done,
so make sure to step outside

46
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,205
and catch that tan
while you can, you heard?

47
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,129
Oh, and if you see a kid that's riding
a bike two sizes too big for him,

48
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,087
that's just Lil Mayor trying
to save the neighborhood all by himself.

49
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,307
Oh, and speaking
of saving the neighborhood,

50
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,383
what's up
with all these missing person flyers?

51
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,906
I thought this new construction
was supposed to make it safer.

52
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,887
Something to think about, y'all.

53
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,309
Bobby!

54
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,019
Lil Cool, where you been, man?

55
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,271
Hanging posters. I'll be right out.

56
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,527
What do you think, Tony?

57
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,030
- Looks good, bro. You a good artist.
- Thanks.

58
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,115
Listen, I appreciate
what you're trying to do,

59
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:27,952
- but to be real…
- No, don't say that. This is gonna work.

60
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,246
- All right, Lil Mayor. Mm-hm.
- You'll see.

61
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:32,914
Man…

62
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,835
you ever wanna get rid
of that Sammy Sosa bat,

63
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,045
you let me know.

64
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,888
Bro, would you ask
King Arthur for his sword?

65
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,925
Let it go? That junk's going on eBay
after they shut me down.

66
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,886
Can you put this on my tab?

67
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,137
And this on your tab.

68
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,056
Yeah, I already know.

69
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,767
- Don't worry. I'll pay you back.
- Course. Go ahead.

70
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,620
- What you doing, Miguel? Come outside.
- Bobby, what's good, bro?

71
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,730
- Tony. What's up?
- Getting into trouble?

72
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,149
Nah.

73
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,317
- Outta here.
- Bye.

74
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,444
Later, bro.

75
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,113
We gotta go, Bobby.

76
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,783
Luis is waiting, and I got
a bunch more posters to put up.

77
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,079
- Hi, Rita.
- What's up, Lil Mayor?

78
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,539
Oh, yeah.

79
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,793
Kid trying to get his play on. I bet you
a beer he strike out. Watch this.

80
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,586
Miguel, I was telling these ladies

81
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,963
about that block party
we putting together Friday night.

82
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:21,881
We?

83
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,716
Yeah, your boy said
he was gonna hook us up

84
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,385
with some VIP passes.

85
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,261
VIP? What VIP?

86
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,681
Rita, let's go. I'm done with these kids.

87
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,372
Yo, Lil Mayor, I wanna keep my beers!

88
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,311
Hey, hold up!

89
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,941
Um, I'll see about the VIP. Just…

90
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:44,362
contribute something to the bodega fund.
It's important for the community.

91
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,906
Y'all love that place.

92
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,784
Yeah, we basically grew up there.

93
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:51,868
So, um…

94
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,454
see you there?

95
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:56,915
Miguel!

96
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,752
Don't get home late.

97
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,087
Is that your mom?

98
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:02,713
Nah.

99
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,215
Why are you ignoring me?

100
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,509
It seems like she knows you.

101
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,137
No, that's just some random lady.

102
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,224
I'm working late tonight. Are you sure
you don't want me to call a babysitter?

103
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,226
Yo.

104
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,105
And strike three!

105
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,314
Kid, you're out.

106
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,734
Run that beer, baby. Run that beer.

107
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:27,321
Yo, we gotta get those girls
to show up to the party.

108
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,740
Bruh, they, like, 16.
They were not feeling us.

109
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,076
They'd be feelin' us
if we had some cash, man.

110
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,079
- We wouldn't look so broke.
- Yo, what the hell is this?

111
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,623
- Another one.
- They got Becky's too.

112
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,042
Yo, I bet she got hella paid, man.

113
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,919
Everybody's cashing out.

114
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:45,047
It's all about getting
that macchiato and gelato money.

115
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,131
Uh-huh.

116
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,051
These Murnau guys
are chewing up our neighborhood.

117
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,181
What was that?

118
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,316
- You see anything?
- Nothing.

119
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,443
- Yo, move over, man.
- Chill.

120
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,986
Are you for real right now?

121
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,322
- It's just dark.
- Can you let me see?

122
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,909
- Yeah!
- Damn, girl. What the hell?

123
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,232
What's wrong with you?
You almost gave us a heart attack.

124
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,664
- That's how people get shot in the hood.
- You ain't shooting nobody, Lil Mayor.

125
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,042
- Bobby, on the other hand…
- Shut up, Gloria.

126
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,544
- Know what happened to Becky's?
- She dipped. Duh.

127
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,188
Got that good money and got outta here,

128
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,133
and now we getting
yummy nine-dollar cappuccinos.

129
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,215
Like…

130
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,593
- You live now?
- Twenty-nine hundred followers,

131
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,957
- what's poppin', GloTV?
- Hey! Block party, Friday night.

132
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,732
- Admission's ten...
- Get outta here, nerd.

133
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,307
Yo, Drake's gonna be there.

134
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,630
- Know what I'm saying?
- Drake?

135
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,394
Yeah. Drake's gonna be there
with you Friday night!

136
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,230
Don't listen to those fools.

137
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,107
Drake ain't coming nowhere
near that block party. Cardi neither.

138
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,443
It's your girl Gloria signing off. Get it.

139
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,166
Yo!

140
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,419
Finally. I've been waiting an hour.

141
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,629
Relax, Tampa.

142
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,882
No, don't start with that.
You know I didn't wanna leave.

143
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,969
Don't see the kid six months,
that's how he says hi. Bam!

144
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,804
Well, well, well.

145
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,516
Hey, Father Jackson. How you doing?

146
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,725
Luis.

147
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,687
Keeping good company, I see.

148
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:28,067
"Enter not into the path of the wicked,
and go not in the way of evil men."

149
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,738
- So dramatic.
- Miguel...

150
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,740
Okay, Bobby got into a minor,

151
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,326
minor altercation in biology, and…

152
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,706
- Father Jackson kicked him out of school.
- You got kicked out?

153
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,642
- Damon started it.
- You're only telling me now?

154
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,959
We didn't want you to worry.

155
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,753
Listen, you worry too much.
I mean, look at yourself.

156
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,338
You're eating your hand off.

157
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,133
This is it. It's finally happened.

158
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,843
I'm out of the crew.

159
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,387
Everything's different now.
Miguel's a politician.

160
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,389
Bobby's voice changed all of a sudden.

161
00:09:58,472 --> 00:09:59,849
He sounds like Denzel now.

162
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,435
I bet you even got leg hairs.

163
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:03,519
Yup.

164
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,609
Who is that?

165
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:14,488
What up, fellas?

166
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,659
Bobby, I ain't heard from you.
We doing this, or what?

167
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,746
Nah. I'm good for now.

168
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,791
All right.
You change your mind, you let me know.

169
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,752
Hey, hey, hey, yo.

170
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,964
Those are nice, son. What size are they?

171
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,091
Uh… nine.

172
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,011
That's a little tight,
but I think we can make it work.

173
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:40,097
- Actually, maybe an eight and a half.
- Come on.

174
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,183
- Just leave him alone.
- No one's talking to you.

175
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,560
I'm talking
to Puerto Rican Harry Potter here.

176
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,606
Let him be, Slim.
All right, boys. I'll be seeing you.

177
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,906
Ah, this kinda stress
makes my blood sugar go nuts.

178
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:00,534
- What was that all about?
- Luis, you really making us look soft.

179
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,619
Bobby?

180
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:06,207
Henny asked me to do something.
I said no. That's it.

181
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,209
Let's forget about it.

182
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,169
Luis, I'm sorry I dissed you.

183
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:11,961
Come on.

184
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,051
- Y'all ready?
- Yeah.

185
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,612
- Listen. I'm gonna spit some.
- Okay.

186
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,720
- Okay?
- All right.

187
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,112
- No. No knap. That's bad.
- Oh, my goodness!

188
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,197
I'm so sorry. Pardon me.

189
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,658
You must be lost.

190
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,410
No, I just moved here.

191
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,911
To the Bronx?

192
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,414
Yes. Why does everyone keep saying that?

193
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,083
Oh, I know. You think I'm gonna, like,

194
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:52,420
call the cops and say it's too loud,
but that's not me.

195
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,630
I wanna get to know my neighbors.
I'm Vivian.

196
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,590
Miguel Martinez. Nice to meet you.

197
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,051
You should come
to our block party Friday night.

198
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,429
We're raising money for Tony's bodega.

199
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,348
Landlord jacked up his rent,
so we're trying to help out.

200
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,183
Here is a flyer.

201
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,727
Oh, my gosh. Wow.

202
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,353
Give me some more flyers,

203
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:13,107
and I can hand them out to my neighbors,
and we can keep this bodega open.

204
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,776
- Have a bunch. Thanks. It means a lot.
- Okay.

205
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,862
Cool. Well, it was nice to meet you.

206
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,947
You, too. Nice meeting you.

207
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,410
You know she's gonna call the cops, right?

208
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,705
No one says they're not gonna call the
cops unless they're gonna call the cops.

209
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,832
- You paranoid, man.
- Come on.

210
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,419
- Let's go.
- That white lady is bad news.

211
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:38,632
- Yo. Check out the courthouse.
- What's up with that red light?

212
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,346
They're turning it into apartments?

213
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:48,225
Y'all know how this starts.
Them white people with canvas bags?

214
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,436
That's always the first sign.

215
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,605
It was the same dudes who got Becky too.

216
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,691
- You got it out for these guys, huh?
- Yeah.

217
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,321
Y'all gonna help me
put up these posters, or what?

218
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,617
Our boy's back in town
to get away from the hell that is Tampa,

219
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,162
and we gon' spend the night
putting up posters for a lost cause?

220
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,331
Lost cause? This is not a lost cause.

221
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:11,414
Do your thing.

222
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,835
Luis. Xbox at Tony's?

223
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,713
Do whatever you want.

224
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,257
Come on. It'll be good. Let's go.

225
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,078
Whoa!

226
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:32,996
Sorry!

227
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,623
- What the...?
- So sorry!

228
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,041
Lil Mayor messed you up.

229
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,377
Yo, man. It ain't funny!
Yo, I'mma kill you!

230
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,629
Pedal hard, Lil Mayor. He mad!

231
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,453
I'mma get you later.

232
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,581
You better watch your back.

233
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,848
Hey. What you doing down here, bro?

234
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,357
Yo, Hamilton.

235
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,983
You lost or something?

236
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,777
Just walking.

237
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,033
Yo, what the hell are you wearing?

238
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:53,868
This?

239
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,830
It's a Belle-Époque
hand-embroidered jacket.

240
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,582
Thank you very much.

241
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,043
Didn't say I liked it.

242
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,549
Hey, stop right there, Mozart.

243
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,901
It's too late to fight back now.

244
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,446
We are going to wipe you out

245
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,325
like the vermin you are.

246
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,786
Fuck!

247
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,934
Ohhh.

248
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,896
- Embarrassing you in your own home.
- Bro, this is the wild bootleg controller.

249
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,149
- Made in Uzbekistan or something.
- Whatever.

250
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,733
Where Miguel at?

251
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,361
Who knows, man? That dude acting crazy.

252
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,323
He's not crazy. He's just passionate,
with big ideas. You know?

253
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,993
He was floating! Oh, my God.

254
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,661
He was floating,

255
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,288
and... and then he killed Slim!

256
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,706
Yo, you see what I mean?

257
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,834
In the air, like… like… like…
and then he bit him with fangs,

258
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,170
like he was some kind of a, uh, uh…

259
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,255
Go! Get! Get! Get!

260
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,132
Yo, what the hell, man?

261
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,721
Welcome to Primo Bodega.

262
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,514
How can I help you?

263
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,436
Just looking.

264
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,648
What a lovely bodega.

265
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,734
Yeah. You know, I like to keep it clean.

266
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,486
You from around here?

267
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,989
- New to the neighborhood.
- Okay.

268
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,492
What do you, uh, do for work?

269
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
Real estate.

270
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,415
Murnau Properties.

271
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:17,929
Wait.

272
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,228
Ah.

273
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,606
There it is.

274
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,075
Hand sanitizer. Yup.

275
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,245
It's a dirty hood, bro.
Four-fifty.

276
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,874
Keep the change.

277
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,717
Yo.

278
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,554
We got vampires in the Bronx.

279
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,305
There's nothing there, stupid.

280
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,683
- What?
- Yeah, go check it out.

281
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,017
What?

282
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,394
No, he was there.

283
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,479
He was… he was… he was right here.

284
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,691
- I knew you was lying.
- I dead-ass saw him bite him in the air.

285
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,193
- You saw it too in the mirror.
- Uh, I don't know.

286
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,736
Okay? I have low blood sugar.

287
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,530
My eyes can't be trusted.

288
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:20,033
And yo, that mirror is dirty as hell.

289
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,618
My mirror?

290
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,453
- You got new mirror money?
- Look…

291
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,417
Second of all, my father gave me
that mirror when he opened back in 1978.

292
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,417
I'm sorry I offended your mirror.

293
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,461
- Listen. The vampire killed him.
- My grandfather came to...

294
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,256
We need to tell someone.

295
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,383
Nobody gonna care that Slim disappeared.

296
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,594
Why? 'Cause he's a gangbanger?

297
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,972
No, homie.
'Cause he's from the Bronx, like us.

298
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,102
Hey, let me take you home.

299
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,021
It's late, you're bugging,

300
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:52,983
and your mother's gonna whoop
your ass and my ass. And I'm a grown man,

301
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,110
and I cannot take
a chancletazo to the face.

302
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,654
Aight? It's embarrassing.
Let's get outta here.

303
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,624
You think the commander
is going to be pleased?

304
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,293
He's bringing bodies in here, Mr. Markus,

305
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:15,005
when he knows we need all the properties
acquired without raising suspicion...

306
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,131
Shut up, Frank.

307
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,091
Yes, sir.

308
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,094
Sun's coming up.

309
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,556
Let's get back inside.

310
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,141
Deal with the body, Frank.

311
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,146
What's poppin'?
It's your girl Gloria, live,

312
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,950
and I hope you got your bagels ready,
'cause I'm serving tea. Get it.

313
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,568
Becky that used to do
my nails on 165, gone.

314
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,196
Dude that used to sell empanadas
on the Concourse, gone.

315
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,323
I don't know what's going on,
but take heed from me,

316
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,076
sleep with one eye open,
and don't get got. Get it.

317
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,162
Hey.

318
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,580
Huh?

319
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,916
Huh.

320
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:54,127
- What time you got in last night?
- I'm thinking about nine-ish.

321
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,129
Aw, that's funny because I was home,

322
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,757
awake-ish after that,
and you weren't here.

323
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,260
Oh.
You were talking about last night.

324
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,511
Um…

325
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,304
I... there was these old ladies,

326
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,431
these, um, blind old ladies.

327
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,849
Tony told me everything.

328
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:09,851
Everything, everything?

329
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,979
I'm always one step ahead of you.

330
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:15,065
Look, I know how much you guys love Tony,

331
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,067
but things change.

332
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,860
The neighborhood changes.

333
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,529
It's our turn.

334
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,198
It's just what happens.

335
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,243
But I'm pretty sure they're not vampires.

336
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,996
Mom! This is serious stuff.

337
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,206
What's serious is you cleaning this room.

338
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,610
Miguel Antonio Martinez!

339
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,655
You said you was cleaning up
these nasty-ass shorts and underwear!

340
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:07,659
- Yo, mom's a savage!
- Yo, she said you got nasty underwear!

341
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,743
She mad at you.

342
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,463
- Sup, Lil Mayor?
- Sup, Lil Mayor?

343
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,760
I know, right?
Is it a clothing store or a restaurant?

344
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,867
Lil Mayor, I know you
gonna let me spin tomorrow night, right?

345
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,931
You know I got that…

346
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,016
Listen, stop.

347
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,659
There's a lot of things happening
in this neighborhood right now.

348
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:37,022
Keep your eyes open.

349
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,528
- All right.
- That was mad vague, dog.

350
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,074
Yo, where's Bobby?

351
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,178
Don't wave at him.

352
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,933
- Why you messing with Henny?
- Chill, man.

353
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,518
I was protecting us.

354
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:17,521
You should be thanking me.
He wanted to know where Slim is.

355
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,874
He hasn't seen him
since he took off after you last night.

356
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,234
Well, didn't you tell him
that a flying vampire killed him?

357
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,653
Right. That whole vampire thing.

358
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,114
Look, don't worry.

359
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,824
I covered for your crazy ass.

360
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,867
Said you went straight to Tony's.

361
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,619
Bro, we good.

362
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:34,913
Come on, man.

363
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,722
What is this crap, yo?

364
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,266
Hey, you gon' pay for that?

365
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,934
Yo, Tony. Where's the cat?

366
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,186
I got a sanitation violation, bro.
They took Vishu.

367
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,479
You got a copy of Blade here?

368
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,980
You got $14.99?

369
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,532
Ohhh!

370
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,659
You see what he did?
He got in there. He put it in.

371
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,995
I can't let you watch this.
Your mother's gonna kill me.

372
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:18,248
Luis, you're the vampire expert.
You need to tell us everything you know.

373
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,208
The basics.

374
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,920
Vampires are undead immortals
that survive on the blood of the living.

375
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,298
They can only go outside at night.
Sunlight kills them.

376
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,461
What do they do in the day?

377
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:31,636
Enclose themselves inside
a protective coffin in total darkness.

378
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,890
Typically, the vampires
will group their coffins

379
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:39,227
in a secret and secure location
called a nest.

380
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,604
A nest.

381
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:44,441
A vampire can be killed
with a silver or wooden stake to the…

382
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:47,319
- To the head. Chu-hoo.
- …heart. They'll disintegrate.

383
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,614
You know those little round cookies

384
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,908
that don't taste
like anything they give out at church?

385
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,534
You mean the Eucharist?

386
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:57,538
You little heathen. If you was at church
once in a while, you'd know that.

387
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,790
Put one of those Eucharists
in a vampire's mouth, and he's toast.

388
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:01,875
All right.

389
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,585
Also garlic. What about that?

390
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,921
- Nah, that's not a thing.
- Yes, a thing.

391
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,923
Garlic is a vampire repellent.

392
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,925
Same with the crucifix.

393
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,718
Holy water is a repellent as well,

394
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,763
but you can also use it
as a vampire detector

395
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,557
because holy water boils
when a vampire is close.

396
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,059
What are you guys talking about?

397
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:20,602
- Vampires.
- Nothing.

398
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,885
Y'all really shouldn't be messing
with that kinda stuff.

399
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,209
Welcome to Primo Bodega.

400
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,943
Big sexy.

401
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,945
That's it.
It's happening right in front of us.

402
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,656
A vampire can only enter
your place if he's invited.

403
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:36,368
Tony let the vampire in last night
when he said, "Welcome to Primo Bodega."

404
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:39,704
Right, right.
Okay, okay. They can't enter bodega.

405
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,331
- All right.
- No, no.

406
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,708
They need an invitation to enter,

407
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,628
and it's not only a bodega.
It can be like a house or something.

408
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:51,258
A message from me. You tell him
it's open season on all suckheads.

409
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,260
Okay.

410
00:25:57,264 --> 00:26:00,350
I don't like that look.
You're about to say something stupid.

411
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,816
We are not going in there.

412
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:08,817
It's daytime.

413
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,944
Nothing to worry about.
They're all asleep, right?

414
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,571
I've gotta be out of my mind.

415
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:16,491
Come on, guys. We need proof.
We got this. We're Blades.

416
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,256
- Hello.
- May I help you?

417
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:35,093
Yes, I'd like to talk to your manager
about a sponsorship opportunity.

418
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,137
Seriously?

419
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:39,763
Um…

420
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:41,808
Here.

421
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,146
Is this your business card?

422
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,480
It's for charity.

423
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:00,952
Are you insane?

424
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,414
- We need to get out of here right now.
- I'm looking for evidence.

425
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:07,417
You know, I think
you're putting way too much faith in shit

426
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,002
that he read in a comic book.

427
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,212
It's a graphic novel.

428
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,631
Shut up.

429
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,093
Come on.

430
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,017
He'll be with you in a moment.

431
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,185
He will?

432
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,710
The afternoon sun can be murder.

433
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,382
Frank Polidori. Pleasure to meet you.

434
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,342
You too.

435
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,679
Step into my office.

436
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,122
So, what can I do for you boys?

437
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,251
Well, we're, um…

438
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,588
doing this event to benefit Tony's bodega,

439
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,672
and…

440
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,140
- We need some sponsorship...
- I'm gonna stop you right there.

441
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,056
How's $2,000 sound?

442
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,393
- You serious?
- You know, you're right.

443
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:50,645
Let's make it three.

444
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,523
You know, Murnau…

445
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:57,652
is very committed to making the Bronx
the best place it can be for all of us.

446
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,073
That's very thoughtful of you.

447
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,200
To put it bluntly,

448
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,036
this place is a forgotten area.

449
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,497
Every last one of you could disappear,

450
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:13,126
and no one would even notice.

451
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,422
Although, I gotta say,

452
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,175
not everyone appreciates
what we're trying to do here.

453
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,553
Would you believe someone glued a flyer

454
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,597
just like this to our sign

455
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,973
outside the courthouse?

456
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,480
You boys wouldn't know
anything about that now, would you?

457
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,357
No, no, no.

458
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:38,734
Luis?

459
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,154
- What's going on here?
- He has low blood sugar.

460
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:44,032
- Maybe we should call his mom.
- Nobody leaves this room.

461
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,284
But he's gonna…

462
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,620
Hey.

463
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,414
What are you guys doing here?

464
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,417
Oh, my gosh. Are you okay?

465
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:56,543
Well…

466
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:57,629
Um…

467
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,422
I'm suddenly feeling much better.

468
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:03,468
We were just talking to Mr. Polidori
about sponsoring the block party, and...

469
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:06,012
You really should. These kids are great.

470
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:08,932
We have an appointment.
I'm sorry. My mind is…

471
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,434
Okay, well, thank you.
Nice seeing you. Nice meeting you.

472
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:12,977
We really must be going.

473
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:13,895
Let's go.

474
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:17,148
Um…
Thank you for the very generous donation.

475
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,235
It'll really help. Oh.

476
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,322
- Go! Go!
- Watch out!

477
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,875
What the hell is this?

478
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,880
A massive vampire nest.

479
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:44,008
Thirteen floors. Twelve coffins per floor.

480
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,553
- That's 300 and...
- One hundred fifty-six vampires.

481
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,179
- Bobby!
- Close enough.

482
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,263
What?

483
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,851
Uh-uh. Don't you talk to me like that.

484
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,936
I ought to smack you upside the head.

485
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,146
And you, too.

486
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,565
You ain't fooling nobody.

487
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,108
I know what you doing.

488
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,652
I'mma check your cookies.

489
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,863
Where you going, Mom?

490
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,007
I'm going to see that man
at the real estate company.

491
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,449
Frank Polidori.

492
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,661
He came by last night,
wanted to know if we were selling!

493
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,663
Uh, you can't talk to him.

494
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,998
What the hell you doing?

495
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:18,585
- Don't go there, Ma.
- He's… he's a really bad man.

496
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,045
Of course he is. He's in real estate,

497
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,089
but as long as his money is also real,

498
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,799
- I'm gon' hear him out.
- Why?

499
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,802
Where'd you get that hat?

500
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:29,637
Bought it.

501
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,599
Psss.
Henny better not have given that to you.

502
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,476
I see what he's trying to do.

503
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,104
Trying to pull you down
the same road to hell as your daddy.

504
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,900
This Frank Polidori,
he's gon' get us out of this house,

505
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,068
keep you away from that life.

506
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,238
Miss Gladys, please trust us.

507
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,322
Don't go there.

508
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,493
But we gon' leave
this mess before you screw up.

509
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:58,416
Y'all can go back
to your nudie search. Hmm.

510
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,671
So, Henny gave you that hat?

511
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,298
So?

512
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,759
There are plans
for dozens of buildings here.

513
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,971
I… I say we take all this to the cops.

514
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,640
- We can't.
- He's right.

515
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,309
- Not enough evidence.
- Not what I thought you'd say.

516
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:20,104
If you don't already believe in vampires,
you're not gonna believe in this.

517
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,481
We need something more.

518
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,858
We need something no one can deny.

519
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,486
We need to find the nest.

520
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:29,405
Also, I stole this,
so we should chill with the cop talk.

521
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:35,578
Don't touch that.

522
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,880
Why isn't your phone on vibrate?

523
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,215
Who are you?

524
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,235
What's poppin', y'all? This is GloTV.
It looks like they got things started

525
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:53,179
at the courthouse. They got mad movers,
and it looks hella fancy in there.

526
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,223
Like, they got chandeliers.
Let's check it out.

527
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,934
Excuse me. What's in those boxes?

528
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:00,186
Uh, Sub-Zeros.

529
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:04,565
They trying to tell me
these big-ass boxes are Sub-Zero fridges.

530
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,484
Damn, these condos
are gonna be nice as hell.

531
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,902
Let me guess.

532
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,237
They ain't refrigerators.

533
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,614
I think we just found the nest.

534
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,176
Yo, am I bugging,
or do these boxes look like coffins?

535
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:31,633
Come on.

536
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:38,765
Yo, it's locked.

537
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:21,017
- Hey, check out the footprints.
- Word, bro.

538
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,143
Mm-hm.

539
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:25,063
This is it.
This is definitely it.

540
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,566
This is bad. This is definitely bad.

541
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,678
Can we please… can we please just go?

542
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,389
Can we just get our asses outta here?

543
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,812
Don't do it, man. Don't...

544
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:06,896
Shh.

545
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,923
And we're prying the coffins open.

546
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,134
Seems unnecessary.

547
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,432
Whoa.

548
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,564
- Told you.
- We got it. Can we just go?

549
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,984
This is the same dude who killed Slim.
I remember his stupid-ass clothes.

550
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,282
- Go!
- Oh, my God!

551
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:00,992
Go!

552
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:04,619
What?

553
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:10,960
Get out!

554
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,795
Open the door!

555
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:13,879
Go!

556
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:28,476
Go! Go!

557
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:30,979
Huh-huh.

558
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,566
Yo. We got 'em.

559
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,653
Yo, Bobby, how you not mute your phone?
You almost killed us in there.

560
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,327
You three are in deep shit.

561
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:48,289
Great plan, Lil Mayor.
I told you cops wouldn't help for shit.

562
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:49,874
Excuse me?

563
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,211
Um, Sanders,
it sounds like they want to go to juvie.

564
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,838
We expected more from you, Lil Mayor.

565
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:05,805
Um…

566
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,308
What are we doing here?

567
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,991
We need to see if Mr. Polidori's
gonna press charges on you three.

568
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,981
- Could this day get any worse?
- Yes.

569
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,695
What is wrong with you? Huh?

570
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,369
What's poppin'? It's your girl Gloria.
We are live and at the scene,

571
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,912
so let me give you all the deets.

572
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:31,916
Lil Mayor and his little friends
got caught up with 5-0 for trespassing.

573
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,417
Such fine boys, aren't they?

574
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,299
His mom had been on him
about some dirty-ass underwear,

575
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,134
and now he's in the back of a police car.

576
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,970
I bet this was your idea, huh?

577
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:47,139
You broke in. How could you do this?
You know how hard I work?

578
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:52,186
This man got some real crazy
Illuminati conspiracy theories

579
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,106
to drop with him and his boys,
and I'm ready for it.

580
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,551
Lil Mayor's about to say wild shit.
Let's go see what he say.

581
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,365
Okay, I know how this looks,
but just trust me.

582
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,909
Everything will make sense
after you see this.

583
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:10,996
See that?

584
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,749
That's the vampire nest.

585
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,876
Inside the courthouse.

586
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,336
Now, brace yourselves.

587
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,297
This is the part
when I open up the coffin.

588
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,800
Can we please…
can we please just go?

589
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,595
Whoa!

590
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:30,016
Uhh, what we supposed to be seeing?

591
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,852
- Vampires.
- What?

592
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,186
- Vampires?
- What?

593
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:36,355
Come on.

594
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:40,776
- That's wild, bro.
- Lil Mayor, what you smoking, man?

595
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,379
You got some more?

596
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,821
I don't understand.

597
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,781
Vampires don't have souls.

598
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,910
They don't have a reflection.

599
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:53,539
You can't see them
in mirrors, photos, or videos.

600
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,502
Know what?
Forget the video. We have their plans

601
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,918
to build deadly vampire nests
all over this neighborhood.

602
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,337
Have a look at this.

603
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,672
Where'd you get this?

604
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,842
Okay, we may have borrowed it,

605
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:08,554
but I'd gladly give it
back to Mr. Polidori if…

606
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,806
and only if he comes out here

607
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,683
and proves he's not a vampire.

608
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,228
Ah, kids.

609
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,941
They have the most wild imaginations.

610
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,611
I caught these three
trespassing at the courthouse,

611
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,821
and they confessed to stealing your file.

612
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,324
Hey, hey, hold on a second.

613
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,785
I can vouch for these kids, bro.
They're good kids.

614
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,579
They were just mixed up
with some crazy vampire idea. That's all.

615
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:36,874
Well, the file has been returned.
I suppose no harm was done.

616
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:37,957
Right, boys?

617
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,835
No need to make this a legal matter.

618
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,504
Thank you so much.

619
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:42,505
We're so sorry.

620
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,948
- We don't know what got into our boys.
- Boys will be boys.

621
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,721
What is wrong with you? Are you crazy?

622
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,682
I bet this was all your idea.
You're gonna end up like your daddy.

623
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:56,060
Who you looking at? Answer me!

624
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,186
Come on. Let's go.

625
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,606
Thank you.

626
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,735
Hey, hey, hey, Carmen.

627
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,654
You let him watch Blade, didn't you?

628
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,030
Blade? What's that?

629
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,742
I am Blade! Vampires…

630
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,411
watch out!

631
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,662
He paid for it.

632
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,747
So that's
how he's getting these crazy ideas?

633
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,874
You're not going
to that bodega ever again.

634
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,418
What? No, no, Mom.

635
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:23,254
Ma, Tony didn't do anything.

636
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:25,777
Go with your mother.
Listen to her. She knows best, all right?

637
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,480
- I know best.
- Forget the vampire stuff.

638
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,278
Commander.

639
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,912
We're going to church to set you right.
And clean up this room!

640
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,508
Yo, open that gate.

641
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,819
Henny, my man.
Thanks for meeting me.

642
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,240
What's this business opportunity
you got for me?

643
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,284
So, my employer has become concerned

644
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,828
that people
in the neighborhood aren't responding…

645
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,414
expeditiously enough
to our financial proposals.

646
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,792
So, I need you to make some…

647
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,712
let's just call it "noise"
in the neighborhood.

648
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,422
Disturbances significant enough

649
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:33,259
to give the last holdouts
the push they need to sell.

650
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,803
Yeah. I ain't interested
in any police attention.

651
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:39,974
'Cause it would negatively impact your
business. I understand that. I can dig it.

652
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,016
However,

653
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,645
what I'm prepared to offer you tonight…

654
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:49,984
is more money for a couple of days' work
than you've made in your entire life.

655
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:57,991
That's right.

656
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,415
Additionally, there's a matter
of a small piece of personal property

657
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:07,668
that's been stolen from us
by a group of neighborhood boys.

658
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:10,796
We'd like the stolen items returned

659
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,881
and the perpetrators…

660
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:15,508
eliminated.

661
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,150
You...

662
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,156
Yo, why you ignoring me?

663
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,991
- What? I called you.
- Luis?

664
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:42,411
Yeah. Listen.
I figured it out. Dude is their familiar.

665
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:43,495
Who is their what?

666
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,207
Frank. The creepy real estate guy.
He's the vampires' familiar.

667
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:51,086
- What is that? Like, a sun vampire?
- No.

668
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,005
A familiar is a human servant

669
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:55,924
who protects his undead master
during the daylight hours.

670
00:43:56,008 --> 00:44:00,262
He does a vampire's bidding in exchange
for eventually becoming a vampire himself.

671
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:03,724
He's making all the deals in the daytime
while the vampires sleep in the nest.

672
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,309
- Exactly.
- Miguel!

673
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,896
- You going to church tonight?
- Yes.

674
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,231
Titi's convinced
I'm possessed by el diablo.

675
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:14,109
El diablo! That's right.
That's why he's going to church tonight.

676
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:16,362
God will save him. The Lord will help him.

677
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:20,824
Told you.

678
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,534
See you there. I got a plan.

679
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:26,830
Come on, man.

680
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,799
Sup, little man?

681
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:39,635
Hey, look, you better go
before my mom spots you.

682
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:42,429
I got something.
Set you and your moms up real nice.

683
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,517
- Yeah, I don't know.
- I'm trying to help you, bruh.

684
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,186
You run out the money your pops left,
kicked out of school.

685
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,109
You gon' keep playing
with your little friends,

686
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:54,441
or you gon' finally grow up,
be the man of the house, get some respect?

687
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:04,410
- What?
- Meet me and Luis at church right now.

688
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:06,954
- No.
- I have a plan to take out these vampires.

689
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:07,871
But we need you!

690
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:08,997
Last chance.

691
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,416
I ain't asking again.

692
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:13,001
- Yo, is that Henny?
- That your boy Miguel?

693
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,336
Let me holla at him.

694
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,588
- I gotta go.
- No! Bobby, don't!

695
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:19,272
- You know how this is gonna end with him.
- End with him?

696
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:20,758
What about with you?

697
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:23,929
In the last day, you got me
into more shit than Henny ever could.

698
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:26,807
I'm done with all this.
And I'm done with you!

699
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:31,686
Yo, Miguel.

700
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,609
- Bobby coming?
- No.

701
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,110
He's with Henny.

702
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,365
But, uh… we can do this without him.

703
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,868
And what is it we're doing?

704
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,120
Well, well, well…

705
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,583
lost lambs returning to the flock.

706
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:55,127
I don't see you two
at Thursday mass very often.

707
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:56,545
Uh…

708
00:45:56,628 --> 00:46:01,216
It's tough with our responsibilities
in the community and so forth and...

709
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,844
Right, right, right.
And where's the other one? Hm?

710
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:08,724
The one that likes to start melees
and fraternizes with known drug dealers?

711
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:09,892
He couldn't make it.

712
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,979
So, can we, uh…

713
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,648
please go?

714
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:17,732
Oh…

715
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:19,609
By all means.

716
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,866
I'll be watching you two.

717
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:27,992
Closely.

718
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:47,346
Miguel.

719
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,684
What are we doing?

720
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:53,768
Shh.

721
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:25,050
Hey, how you doing?
Welcome to Primo Bodega.

722
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,134
How can I help you?

723
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,931
Is this the famous bodega
Lil Mayor's trying to save?

724
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,016
Yes, it is. You know Miguel?

725
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,520
- Doesn't everybody?
- Yeah, it's true.

726
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:39,273
Actually, I want to help out
with the block party.

727
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,525
I was thinking of making maple scones.

728
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,819
- Maple scones?
- Yeah.

729
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,821
Yeah, that's a dope idea.

730
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:48,949
- Is it lame?
- No, nah.

731
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,492
Maple scones are dope.

732
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:53,453
Is, uh… is he around?

733
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,998
Miguel? Nah, man, that boy is bugging.

734
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:58,917
I taught him way better than that.
I practically raised them boys, man.

735
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,321
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah, man.

736
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:03,314
When their parents were working,
they were here in the bodega, hanging out,

737
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:06,592
doing homework, playing video games,
staying out of trouble.

738
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:08,218
Are you a baseball fan?

739
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,761
Oh, this right here?

740
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:14,933
This is the bat that Sammy Sosa,
the pride of San Pedro de Macorís,

741
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:18,061
used to hit 60 home runs in one season.

742
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,564
- Wow.
- Which had only been done four times

743
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:23,150
in the history of baseball.
You know how old baseball is?

744
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,027
It's old as shit.

745
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:28,196
But that was before he started bleaching
his skin, looking like Count Chocula

746
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,960
and one of these vampires
that Miguel thinks is in the neighborhood,

747
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,492
sucking on people's necks.

748
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:33,660
I heard about that.

749
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:34,786
Yeah.

750
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,581
But, yeah.
Check out the store. Peruse my wares,

751
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:40,250
you know?
I got some new stuff. I got some kale.

752
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:43,378
I got another type of kale,
some flaxseeds.

753
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,380
You know? Some organic aloe,

754
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:46,965
whatever you need, you know?

755
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,258
I just need this.

756
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,843
- That's it? Just the hummus?
- Uh-hm.

757
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,678
Okay. Um…

758
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:53,972
You know what? On the house.

759
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:55,098
Real talk?

760
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,893
Yeah. You coming through with scones,
I come through with hummus.

761
00:48:58,977 --> 00:48:59,977
Thank you.

762
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:03,523
I can see why Miguel
thinks this place is so special.

763
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:07,569
Let me get you a bag. I don't want you
walking around with bare hummus.

764
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,287
What the…?

765
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,251
I'm out of bags.

766
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,338
I guess I'll see you at the block party.

767
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:28,839
Mm-hm.

768
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:30,759
Oh, uh…

769
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,053
Tell Miguel I'm looking for him.

770
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,805
Okay.

771
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,399
You've reached Lil Mayor.
Leave a message.

772
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,194
Yo, shorty really is a vampire, dog.
I looked at the thing...

773
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:20,559
Shit.

774
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:30,694
You'll never get them.

775
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:40,996
The body of Christ.

776
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,292
The body of Christ.

777
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,920
The body of Christ.

778
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,048
I got my eye on you.

779
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:55,385
The body of Christ.

780
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,012
The body of Christ.

781
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:04,895
Let's all pray.

782
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:11,358
Hey.

783
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,886
This is like a top-five sin.

784
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:40,597
Yes! Holy water.

785
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,100
How do we get it out of here?

786
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,209
There we go.

787
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,887
Shh. Someone's coming.

788
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:33,733
Those shits stole my Sprite.

789
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:43,785
We got the holy water,
the Eucharist, and now... Oh.

790
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:46,913
Hey, hi. Hi, Rita. Hey.

791
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,957
I saw you two going into the sacristy.

792
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:52,043
- What were y'all doing back there?
- What? No. Um…

793
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,171
- We were busy doing…
- We were trying...

794
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,881
- …church stuff.
- Yes.

795
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:56,964
Church stuff.

796
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,176
- Why are you two carrying those bottles?
- This? Oh...

797
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,093
I have…

798
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,761
- low blood sugar.
- Low blood sugar.

799
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:04,806
- Can I have some?
- No!

800
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:05,890
No, you shouldn't.

801
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:08,185
See, y'all better tell me
what's really going on here

802
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,978
before I get Father Jackson out here.

803
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:12,688
Um…

804
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:16,610
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

805
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:18,570
Try me.

806
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:20,779
Okay.

807
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:27,119
So…

808
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:30,248
we talked about me doing, like…

809
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,792
messenger-type stuff.

810
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:34,668
We did.

811
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,547
Then, do we really need all of this?

812
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,468
What'd you think this was gonna be, bruh?

813
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,971
You wanna be in business,
be a big man and get paid,

814
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,306
this what it looks like.

815
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,484
Don't try telling me I'm good.

816
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:07,661
Aight, we going
to every store on the block tonight.

817
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:10,247
If they open, rob whoever's
at the register. If they ain't,

818
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,249
smash the place up,
loot it up, shoot it up.

819
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:14,626
- Frank wants 'em wrecked.
- Frank?

820
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,169
We working for Frank?

821
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:19,547
- Like, the Murnau guy?
- Yeah, you got a problem with that?

822
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:22,384
Nah.

823
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,218
Come here.

824
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:29,057
Got a special job for you.

825
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:31,726
Where Lil Mayor
and that Puerto Rican kid at?

826
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,890
- Why you need to know?
- Why I need to know?

827
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,606
This ain't a democracy, son.

828
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,567
I tell you what I need,
and you give it to me, understand?

829
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:41,944
Yeah.

830
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:44,906
Now, find out where they at.

831
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:48,325
Strap up.

832
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,498
Um…

833
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,625
I gotta use the bathroom real quick.

834
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,253
Boy piss his pants already?

835
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,144
Oh.

836
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,238
- Vampires? Are you serious?
- I know how it sounds, but...

837
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,122
No, I'm saying,
are you seriously out at night

838
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:28,742
when there's vampires running around?

839
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:32,162
It's actually five vampires
based on the number of coffins we saw.

840
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,788
So, do you believe me?

841
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:34,872
We're Haitian, man.

842
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:37,751
My grandma's been preparing me
for this my entire life.

843
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,003
How you think I knew
why nothing was in your videos?

844
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:42,130
We're gonna need some garlic
and some wooden stakes

845
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,340
right the hell now.

846
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:45,842
Hey, what happened to Tony's?

847
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:50,387
Oh, no.

848
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:54,809
Let's pull it off.

849
00:55:58,605 --> 00:55:59,605
Hey.

850
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,193
What you doing here?

851
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:05,570
Helping you. What you think?

852
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:07,197
Oh, no. I thought you was with Henny.

853
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,960
Turn up like your dad,
shot in the streets.

854
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:09,990
Yo!

855
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:11,451
Don't talk about my pops.

856
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:14,537
While you was off playing gangsta,
them vampires got Tony.

857
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,581
Yo! What are you two doing?

858
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,875
We're supposed to be best friends.

859
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,338
Um… are y'all done?

860
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:26,216
Because I'd like to get inside
before vampires try to eat us.

861
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:27,459
Can y'all open the damn door?

862
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:58,623
Oh, my God.

863
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:06,131
Maybe… maybe they just took him.

864
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:08,466
Vampires don't take hostages.

865
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:18,309
This is my fault.

866
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:21,521
I mixed Tony up in this.

867
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:22,981
I brought them in here.

868
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,151
Don't say that.

869
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:28,068
Listen, man.

870
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:29,571
It's not your fault…

871
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:32,072
at all.

872
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:35,826
Guys.

873
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,288
Uh, look who just rolled up on us.

874
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:42,625
Yo, we gotta go.
Henny's working for Murnau,

875
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:44,711
and Frank hired him to find you.

876
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:46,074
My God, one night with you guys,

877
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,315
and I already have vampires
and thugs trying to kill me?

878
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:49,339
Let's go.

879
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:52,092
I see you.

880
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,062
Holy shit.

881
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:10,194
This way.

882
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:18,411
Vivian. There's vampires out there.
Come with us.

883
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,495
Come.

884
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,961
A little early for Halloween, ain't it?

885
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:28,630
What y'all supposed to be?

886
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:35,261
Why don't you four little freaks
empty your pockets for us?

887
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:41,141
One…

888
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,227
two…

889
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:52,153
I'm talking about!
We smoked them fools!

890
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,321
That's what's up!

891
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,792
Fuck!

892
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:11,214
Coming!

893
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,053
I'm sorry. I'll put the music down.

894
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,436
Luis, Bobby…

895
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,816
Call your mother and your tía.
They're worried sick.

896
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,489
Call your mom too. Okay?

897
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,534
I'm so sorry for whatever they did.

898
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:42,370
Oh, they didn't do anything wrong.
I was just bringing them home.

899
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:44,372
Oh. Wow.

900
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:47,250
- First time for everything.
- Oh, I like your house.

901
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:49,460
Thank you.

902
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,171
All these colors are so cute.

903
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,299
Oh, thank you.

904
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:56,259
It's such a beautiful home.

905
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,429
You're too kind, Ms…

906
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:02,849
Oh, Vivian. Vivian. Yeah.

907
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:09,814
I'm sorry.
I feel so silly just standing out here.

908
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:10,773
Can I come in?

909
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:13,484
- No!
- Luis Acosta de la Vega!

910
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:15,403
Mom, don't let her in.

911
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:17,526
She can't attack without an invitation.

912
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:20,742
Lil Mayor,
why would I want to attack you?

913
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:22,493
Because you're a vampire!

914
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:25,038
- Bobby!
- This lady's a vampire, Ms. Martinez.

915
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:27,707
That's why she can't enter.
She needs an invitation.

916
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,626
I need my key back, Miguel.

917
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:34,380
Give it to me before I drain you
like I did your late friend, Tony.

918
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,132
What are you?

919
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:38,176
I'm Vivian Tyrell,

920
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:40,136
firstborn of the Master Murnau,

921
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:42,388
commander in the vampire expedition.

922
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,557
Expedition? What kind of expedition?

923
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,643
To find my people a home.

924
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:49,312
You see, I'm just like you, Miguel.

925
01:00:50,104 --> 01:00:52,315
I don't want the Bronx to change.

926
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:56,152
It's easier to live somewhere
where no one cares when people disappear.

927
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:57,235
I'm nothing like you!

928
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:01,324
If you give me my key back,

929
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:03,493
I promise to make your deaths quick.

930
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:07,663
Fine.

931
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:11,292
I'll give you your key.

932
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:27,642
Mommy, don't worry.
We're safe as long as we stay in here.

933
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:30,228
I'm calling the police.

934
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:32,730
You already saw with Frank.
The police are on their side.

935
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:34,654
We need to stay in here
until the sun comes up.

936
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,235
Call your families.
We're staying here tonight.

937
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:39,862
In the morning, we're out of the Bronx.

938
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:41,114
It's not worth it.

939
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:50,997
Commander.

940
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:02,218
- Is it done?
- Yes, commander.

941
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:06,431
We had to go above-market,
and it was an all-cash deal,

942
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:09,058
but the building is yours.

943
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:13,187
No need for an invitation
to the kid's apartment.

944
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:16,566
Um…

945
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:17,649
Commander…

946
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:19,609
I was just…

947
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:22,613
I was wondering
when I'd be getting the gift.

948
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:28,244
You know, I feel
like I'm… I'm ready for it.

949
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:37,295
Make another mistake,

950
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,173
you'll never get the gift.

951
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:43,009
You'll never be one of us.

952
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:21,631
- So good.
- Yo.

953
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:26,093
Yo, what are you doing?

954
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:30,014
Going to the nest.

955
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:33,226
I'm gonna take out
every last one of them.

956
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:36,270
We gotta defend ourselves.

957
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:40,650
We gotta show them
that Tony and everyone else matters.

958
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:45,780
If we do it together,
we might have a chance.

959
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:47,405
Bet.

960
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,077
We're going with you.

961
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,121
I'm done being scared.

962
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:33,578
Yo, what you doing with that stick?

963
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:38,666
Hey, come back with that thing, man!

964
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:53,221
Hey.

965
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,182
Thanks for the invite.

966
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,268
- We didn't know that...
- Here.

967
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:58,895
Welcome to the crew.

968
01:04:59,478 --> 01:05:01,814
Thanks. Now, let's go kill some suckheads.

969
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:08,820
This way.

970
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,046
- This is the nest.
- Yeah, I know.

971
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:29,342
That's her sarcophagus right there.
If we strike her, we weaken the others.

972
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:30,842
Uh?

973
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,553
You guys knew that, right?

974
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:34,639
No.

975
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:37,016
That's why I told y'all
not to be messing with this stuff.

976
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,022
All right, three, two…

977
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:52,490
- What the hell?
- They knew we were coming.

978
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:54,241
They could be anywhere.

979
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:02,249
You gave that to Vivian.

980
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,962
We gotta go back and warn everybody.

981
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:10,341
- Bobby!
- The balloons.

982
01:06:10,424 --> 01:06:11,424
Damn.

983
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,389
What is it?

984
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:17,682
It's bubbling.

985
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:29,086
- They must be up here.
- Miguel, it's too dangerous.

986
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:30,110
Don't go up there.

987
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:32,947
We have 30 minutes to sundown.
If we can find their hiding place,

988
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:34,365
we can get a jump on them.

989
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:36,826
Well, we coming too.

990
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,829
Well, someone has to go warn everyone.

991
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:41,789
I'll go, and I'll get Father Jackson.

992
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:44,512
Listen, just promise me you
won't go in that room without us, okay?

993
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:47,961
Okay.

994
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:49,880
Hey!

995
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:55,011
Can you tell my mom that I love her…

996
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:58,180
and that I'm sorry about, um…

997
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:00,725
uh, about my room,

998
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:02,225
about lying,

999
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:04,645
about everything?

1000
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:08,524
Listen, you tell her…

1001
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:11,568
when you see her.

1002
01:07:19,493 --> 01:07:21,912
Yo, Rita. Like, what about the rest of us?

1003
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:23,789
We all got messages, you know?

1004
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:28,044
I guess you didn't need
to use them VIP passes after all, playa.

1005
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,127
Let's go.

1006
01:08:06,665 --> 01:08:07,666
This is it.

1007
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:10,461
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1008
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:12,587
Let's go.

1009
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:23,641
Where the hell are they?

1010
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:29,646
Guys.

1011
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:50,376
What are you doing?

1012
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:54,380
We definitely dying today.

1013
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:17,987
- Ah!
- Ah-oh!

1014
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:43,971
Not smart, Lil Mayor.

1015
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:54,356
- What do we do now?
- Um…

1016
01:09:56,066 --> 01:09:57,902
Open the curtains! Let the daylight in!

1017
01:09:57,985 --> 01:09:59,069
Suck on this!

1018
01:10:09,413 --> 01:10:11,040
What do we have here?

1019
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,376
How thoughtful of you.

1020
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:18,797
I bought your building
so I could enter and retrieve this key,

1021
01:10:19,673 --> 01:10:21,759
but you just saved me the trouble.

1022
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:34,188
What is that?

1023
01:10:34,271 --> 01:10:37,149
This is the remains of the first vampire.

1024
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:39,652
My maker.

1025
01:10:40,861 --> 01:10:42,446
The maker of all of us.

1026
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:44,782
His ashes have the power

1027
01:10:44,865 --> 01:10:46,617
to make new vampires.

1028
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,285
One handful of this

1029
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:50,496
in your mother's face,

1030
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:52,915
a bite on her neck,

1031
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:55,459
and she becomes one of us.

1032
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:04,927
Ah.

1033
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:06,886
Body of Christ.

1034
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:12,935
Luis! Luis! Come on. Let's go.

1035
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:15,813
Yo! Did you just melt that guy's face?

1036
01:11:15,896 --> 01:11:17,564
- Yeah. It was crazy!
- Go!

1037
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:21,025
Go, go, go, go!

1038
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:23,070
Boys!

1039
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:26,282
Whoa! Chill, man. Chill.

1040
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:31,036
Bobby, Bobby, where are you going?

1041
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,121
Listen, Frank.

1042
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:34,290
They're lying to you, man.

1043
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:36,834
You might be rich…

1044
01:11:37,334 --> 01:11:38,334
and immortal,

1045
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:41,297
but you'll never be one of them.

1046
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:43,841
I know that for a fact.

1047
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:47,177
You'll be their kid brother, right?

1048
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:50,139
That means you gonna be their bitch.

1049
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,559
Like, for all eternity.

1050
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:02,692
That's what's up?

1051
01:12:09,366 --> 01:12:10,366
Go.

1052
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:13,995
Go!

1053
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,334
Go! Go!

1054
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:39,772
Useless once again.

1055
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:51,949
You hungry?

1056
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:55,662
Let's find those boys.

1057
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:58,499
- Pedal faster, Miguel!
- I'm trying!

1058
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:08,425
Vampire! Go!

1059
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:13,514
- Luis!
- Go!

1060
01:13:37,204 --> 01:13:39,206
Sneaking around
where you don't belong.

1061
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:40,833
Little rat.

1062
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:49,174
Aghh!

1063
01:14:09,486 --> 01:14:11,113
How you like that, suckhead?

1064
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:15,033
Let's cut through here and get Luis.
Come on.

1065
01:14:22,749 --> 01:14:24,126
Miguel.

1066
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:27,129
Bobby, Lil Mayor, Bobby,

1067
01:14:27,212 --> 01:14:29,673
Miguel, Miguel, Miguel, Bobby…

1068
01:14:29,756 --> 01:14:30,966
Miguel…

1069
01:14:31,049 --> 01:14:32,050
Bobby…

1070
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:39,933
Bobby! You all right? Whoa!

1071
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:55,157
Miguel, close your eyes!

1072
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,451
You didn't really stand a chance.

1073
01:14:57,534 --> 01:14:59,703
I have survived
seven centuries, countless attacks.

1074
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:00,787
Miguel!

1075
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:03,415
I am
the most formidable creature on earth.

1076
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:04,500
And you?

1077
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:06,210
You're just a bunch of poor kids

1078
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:08,504
from this shithole you call the Bronx.

1079
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:10,672
Hey, yo!

1080
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,802
Yo, fuck you say about the Bronx?

1081
01:15:15,886 --> 01:15:18,680
I know
you just didn't call the Bronx a shithole!

1082
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:23,101
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, shit.

1083
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:55,676
Yeah, but, girl,
did you see his girlfriend?

1084
01:15:55,759 --> 01:15:57,570
- Uh, she ugly, though.
- Look at her.

1085
01:15:57,594 --> 01:15:58,594
That's her?

1086
01:15:58,637 --> 01:15:59,972
- Her hair's even!
- Psst!

1087
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:03,475
- Hell, yeah, she got a weave.
- Mm-hm. She ain't fooling nobody.

1088
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:06,353
- She needs to take it back. How stupid.
- Psst! Psst!

1089
01:16:06,436 --> 01:16:08,105
- Jenny and Kendra!
- She...

1090
01:16:10,357 --> 01:16:13,026
- Who this bitch?
- I don't know, but she ugly.

1091
01:16:17,197 --> 01:16:19,116
- Gotta be going!
- Aghh!

1092
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:30,001
Ahh!

1093
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:46,018
That's nasty.

1094
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:59,406
Anyone move, and I'll snap his neck!

1095
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:11,585
It's time for some reinforcements.

1096
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:21,803
And now, the finishing touch.

1097
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:22,971
Oh.

1098
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:24,931
Vivian!

1099
01:17:55,587 --> 01:17:57,547
Thanks for the bat, Tony.

1100
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:14,034
Yo, you don't mess with the Bronx!

1101
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:15,774
You got 'em! Yeah!

1102
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:19,736
Make some noise for Lil Mayor, y'all!

1103
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:24,449
We got 'em!

1104
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:29,454
- You're such a good boy!
- Mom!

1105
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:38,714
Yo, y'all see that?

1106
01:18:38,797 --> 01:18:41,091
Lil Mayor and his crew
did some real action-hero shit!

1107
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:43,259
Hey.

1108
01:18:52,102 --> 01:18:54,479
Hold up. Wait. What are you doing?

1109
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:56,314
Oh.

1110
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:57,566
- That wasn't that?
- No.

1111
01:18:57,649 --> 01:18:58,984
Sorry. I thought…

1112
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:00,986
It's all right. It's... it's okay.

1113
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:02,320
- Sorry.
- Bye.

1114
01:19:05,323 --> 01:19:06,867
Aight, lover boy.

1115
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:10,620
- Slow your roll, man. She's 16.
- I don't know. I'm…

1116
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:14,958
- Just don't forget your boys, all right?
- Man, you kidding?

1117
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:16,877
I love you guys.

1118
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:45,572
Oh, yeah!

1119
01:19:45,655 --> 01:19:46,698
Oh, my God!

1120
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:52,287
Oh, yeah!
Let's hit it. You know what you doing?

1121
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:53,955
- Hit 'em with it.
- We gonna hit 'em.

1122
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:55,999
- You ready? You ready?
- Uh-huh. Let's go.

1123
01:19:56,082 --> 01:19:57,709
- You ready? They ain't ready.
- Yeah.

1124
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:59,633
- Yeah. I think they ready.
- Ready? You ready?

1125
01:19:59,711 --> 01:20:00,711
- Rap.
- All right.

1126
01:20:04,424 --> 01:20:06,224
Let's make sure
people are having a good time,

1127
01:20:06,259 --> 01:20:07,928
but we gotta stay on the lookout.

1128
01:20:08,011 --> 01:20:10,138
Us daywalkers
gotta make sure everyone's safe.

1129
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:11,723
- Daywalkers?
- Yeah.

1130
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,433
That's corny, yo.

1131
01:20:13,934 --> 01:20:18,605
Daywalker, as in Blade the Daywalker
and greatest vampire hunter of all time?

1132
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,564
Of all time.

1133
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:22,275
I don't know about all time,
but we pretty damn good at this.

1134
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:23,819
- Hell, yeah!
- Hell, yeah!

1135
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:30,784
What's poppin', y'all? It's your girl
Gloria with a final GloTV update.

1136
01:20:30,867 --> 01:20:34,037
All is well in the Bronx yet again,
but we gonna keep grinding,

1137
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,289
shining, and holding each other down.

1138
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:37,999
Oh, and to all future invaders,

1139
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,377
you don't want no smoke with the BX.

1140
01:20:40,877 --> 01:20:41,877
Get it.
