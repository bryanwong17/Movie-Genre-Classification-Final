00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:34,583
Sister Catherine, I come
on behalf of the devil.

3
00:00:40,256 --> 00:00:42,923
You are an enemy of
Satan and you will burn

4
00:00:42,925 --> 00:00:44,802
with hellfire if you
do not cooperate.

5
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:53,811
Come on, I know you're here!

6
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:18,249
Sister, are you here?

7
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:29,302
Sister, are you...

8
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,444
Get out!

9
00:01:50,952 --> 00:01:52,826
Shit, too far.

10
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:53,662
Too far.

11
00:02:17,854 --> 00:02:18,688
Hello?

12
00:02:20,064 --> 00:02:20,898
Somebody!

13
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,830
What the hell?

14
00:03:14,076 --> 00:03:16,368
No, no, no, no please, no!

15
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,872
Oh God, please no!

16
00:03:50,362 --> 00:03:51,987
Hey, 21.09.

17
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:53,156
Here you go.

18
00:03:56,118 --> 00:03:56,992
Thanks.

19
00:03:56,994 --> 00:03:57,828
Have a good one.

20
00:04:01,082 --> 00:04:01,916
Wait.

21
00:04:04,126 --> 00:04:05,334
21.09.

22
00:04:05,336 --> 00:04:06,838
You gave me 21.06.

23
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,881
It's three cents.

24
00:04:14,511 --> 00:04:16,054
I don't have three cents.

25
00:04:32,946 --> 00:04:34,196
Want some
help with that?

26
00:04:34,198 --> 00:04:35,531
No, I think I got it.

27
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:36,365
Are you sure?

28
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:37,199
Ooh, pizza!

29
00:04:47,211 --> 00:04:48,252
Done?

30
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:49,338
I think so.

31
00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:51,340
Thank God.

32
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,259
Can't believe your aunt
let us stay here this long.

33
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,843
She has three houses.

34
00:04:56,845 --> 00:04:58,553
She probably forgot
we were here.

35
00:04:58,555 --> 00:05:00,264
God, three houses.

36
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,477
I'm excited to finally
have one house.

37
00:05:03,727 --> 00:05:06,269
You didn't think
it would happen.

38
00:05:06,271 --> 00:05:07,147
I didn't.

39
00:05:08,523 --> 00:05:10,774
We've come a long way.

40
00:05:10,776 --> 00:05:13,320
That is an understatement.

41
00:05:15,364 --> 00:05:16,738
Where did you find this?

42
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,324
Your sister
gave it to me.

43
00:05:18,326 --> 00:05:20,117
Can we lose it in the move?

44
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,370
No, you'd regret it.

45
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:23,581
Yeah, maybe you would.

46
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:33,757
You're not gonna make me, like,

47
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:37,593
change my look or
anything, right?

48
00:05:37,595 --> 00:05:40,682
Like, ditch the nose
ring, go blonde?

49
00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:43,807
Are you serious?

50
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:47,478
I mean, we're moving to
such a nice neighborhood,

51
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,982
and your position's so big, I...

52
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:55,321
Never.

53
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:57,532
That's who I married.

54
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:01,451
Just don't go back
to the '08 look.

55
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:03,830
Deal.

56
00:06:33,609 --> 00:06:36,192
Hey, Anna, it's Lex.

57
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:37,070
Uh, call me.

58
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:39,780
I heard you and Mike are finally

59
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:41,531
moving out of his aunt's house.

60
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:43,367
I know I shouldn't be calling,

61
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:47,370
but I'd like to see Claire
before you move out.

62
00:06:47,372 --> 00:06:48,538
Gettin' cleaned up, you know,

63
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,374
and I don't care
what some judge says,

64
00:06:51,376 --> 00:06:53,670
she's my daughter
too, and I've got a.

65
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:14,900
Claire?

66
00:07:16,026 --> 00:07:18,320
Hmm, where is she?

67
00:07:19,321 --> 00:07:21,574
She's got a big day tomorrow.

68
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:25,118
Maybe she's under here!

69
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,332
No, hmm.

70
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:33,211
What about in here?

71
00:07:35,004 --> 00:07:35,838
No.

72
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,465
I hear something though.

73
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,177
Maybe she's under here!

74
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,064
Mom?

75
00:07:54,523 --> 00:07:56,064
Well you're a good hider.

76
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:57,442
I wasn't hiding.

77
00:07:58,653 --> 00:07:59,487
Sure.

78
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:06,742
Did you brush your teeth?

79
00:08:06,744 --> 00:08:08,201
Perfect.

80
00:08:08,203 --> 00:08:11,038
Are you excited to move
into your own room tomorrow?

81
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,288
Very!

82
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,709
Can you believe it,
your very own room?

83
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:16,293
This is my own room.

84
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,963
No, not some old guest
room, your own room.

85
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,467
One that you can decorate
however you want.

86
00:08:22,718 --> 00:08:24,175
I'm just glad I
don't have to sleep

87
00:08:24,177 --> 00:08:27,014
on the floor like I
did in the old house.

88
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:29,141
Me too.

89
00:08:31,686 --> 00:08:34,312
Oh, Daddy dropped
something again.

90
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:35,437
Again?

91
00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:37,355
He's clumsy, isn't he?

92
00:08:38,443 --> 00:08:40,025
Goodnight, love bug.

93
00:08:40,027 --> 00:08:40,861
Night.

94
00:08:48,535 --> 00:08:49,619
Jesus, Mike.

95
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,538
What?

96
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,496
Was that you?

97
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:54,831
Was what me?

98
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,917
Did you knock something over?

99
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,336
Not this time.

100
00:08:58,338 --> 00:08:59,754
Comin' to bed?

101
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:01,839
Yeah, one sec.

102
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:38,833
Oh my God!

103
00:09:38,835 --> 00:09:40,086
You asshole!

104
00:09:40,088 --> 00:09:41,796
I didn't mean to scare you.

105
00:09:41,798 --> 00:09:42,754
Yes you did!

106
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:43,589
I swear I didn't.

107
00:09:43,591 --> 00:09:44,506
Yeah, okay.

108
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:45,550
Yeah, okay.

109
00:09:46,593 --> 00:09:47,634
You know what?

110
00:09:47,636 --> 00:09:49,554
Better watch your back, Michael.

111
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:53,224
Watch my back?

112
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:54,350
Mhmm.

113
00:09:54,352 --> 00:09:55,393
Michael?

114
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,980
Am I actually in trouble?

115
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:43,443
I thought of a way to repay you.

116
00:10:48,405 --> 00:10:49,239
Oh my God.

117
00:10:54,161 --> 00:10:55,119
You know,
I think Claire's

118
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,164
really excited about tomorrow.

119
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,831
Yeah, I know.

120
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,878
I'm just still not sure about
this private school thing.

121
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:05,672
What's wrong with
private school?

122
00:11:06,882 --> 00:11:08,548
Private school's
like second place

123
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,467
awkward to home school.

124
00:11:11,596 --> 00:11:12,845
I went to private school.

125
00:11:12,847 --> 00:11:14,639
Yeah, and look at
you, you're a mess.

126
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,307
Mmm, yeah.

127
00:11:20,438 --> 00:11:22,814
You know, it's not too
late to change your mind.

128
00:11:24,275 --> 00:11:25,774
Nah.

129
00:11:25,776 --> 00:11:28,112
I mean their gifted program
is supposed to be amazing.

130
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,574
They'll give her the
attention she needs there.

131
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,034
I still think you should
have gone to a gifted school.

132
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:37,286
As if!

133
00:11:37,288 --> 00:11:40,373
No, no Claire did not
get her brains from me.

134
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,460
She sure as hell didn't
get 'em from her dad.

135
00:11:46,255 --> 00:11:47,090
I'm sorry.

136
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,756
I didn't mean to bring him up.

137
00:11:49,758 --> 00:11:53,760
No, um, it's actually interesting
that you mention him.

138
00:11:53,762 --> 00:11:55,471
He's not calling again, is he?

139
00:11:55,473 --> 00:11:57,597
No, no, nothing like that.

140
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:59,351
Um, I don't know.

141
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,477
Stuff with the move is
just reminding me of him

142
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:05,941
and all that shit with the
divorce and then going to rehab.

143
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:10,403
And I'm just realizing
how far I've come.

144
00:12:10,405 --> 00:12:11,736
It's a good thing, right?

145
00:12:11,738 --> 00:12:13,156
Of course, yes.

146
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,283
I guess it's just hard to stop

147
00:12:17,285 --> 00:12:19,622
associating yourself
with all that.

148
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,206
The only thing
you need to worry

149
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,837
about now is moving
past all that.

150
00:12:28,296 --> 00:12:30,172
Maybe I should go blonde.

151
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:32,674
Be my trophy wife?

152
00:12:32,676 --> 00:12:33,801
Yeah.

153
00:12:35,304 --> 00:12:37,178
I think I've always been
a blonde on the inside.

154
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,639
Oh, totally.

155
00:12:38,641 --> 00:12:43,311
A very very very dark blonde.

156
00:12:43,313 --> 00:12:45,312
Mhmm.
Mhmm.

157
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,615
What, no scrubs?

158
00:12:56,617 --> 00:12:58,451
Nah, I wanna
look professional.

159
00:12:58,453 --> 00:13:00,911
Yeah, but I like that whole
hunky medical show vibe.

160
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:01,745
Oh yeah?

161
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:02,580
Mhmm.

162
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,499
Well, get to work.

163
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:06,958
Those damn teeth
don't pull themselves.

164
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
They better not.

165
00:13:07,962 --> 00:13:09,628
Meet ya at the new house at six?

166
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,672
Yeah, yeah, I'll drive
the moving truck over.

167
00:13:11,674 --> 00:13:13,090
Perfect.

168
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,841
Are you ready for my Aunt Donna?

169
00:13:14,843 --> 00:13:16,509
Oh yeah, and I've
got a gun in my purse

170
00:13:16,511 --> 00:13:18,220
in case she gets too feisty.

171
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:22,850
There she is.

172
00:13:22,852 --> 00:13:27,480
Look at you!

173
00:13:27,482 --> 00:13:28,605
You excited?

174
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:29,440
Yeah.

175
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:30,441
Don't be shy.

176
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:31,942
I know.

177
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,860
Being shy's the last thing
she's gotta worry about.

178
00:13:33,862 --> 00:13:36,113
Yeah, well, you
didn't get that from me.

179
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:38,948
Goodbye, love you.

180
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,034
I love you too.

181
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,039
You ready?

182
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,376
Yeah.

183
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,732
No, no, no, no, no, no.

184
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:46,517
Oh thank God you're here.

185
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,934
I can never find the right key.

186
00:14:47,936 --> 00:14:49,937
I'm Donna Winslow,
I'm Michael's aunt.

187
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:50,939
Yeah, we've met.

188
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,190
Many times.

189
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,860
I'm here to check the
house before you go.

190
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:58,195
Sure, um, well
I just need to...

191
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:01,157
I'm in a hurry, I
left my dog in the car.

192
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,408
Oh, okay.

193
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,746
Um, well can you start upstairs?

194
00:15:06,204 --> 00:15:09,291
It's my house, I'll
start where I want.

195
00:15:18,593 --> 00:15:21,052
On second thought,
turn on my AC.

196
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:22,347
I want to be thorough.

197
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:34,858
Oh no.

198
00:15:36,234 --> 00:15:37,152
Oh no, what?

199
00:15:38,945 --> 00:15:41,238
Uh, was that you
in the spare room?

200
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,530
I was in the office.

201
00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:44,700
The paint on the
wall is chipped.

202
00:15:44,702 --> 00:15:47,370
It costs $55 to repaint it.

203
00:15:47,372 --> 00:15:49,080
I'll need that by Thursday.

204
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,585
That better not
be a busted pipe.

205
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:55,922
The hardwood is scuffed.

206
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:59,423
It will cost $200 to fix it.

207
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,801
I'll need that by Thursday.

208
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:06,891
Don't forget your dishes.

209
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,308
They'll need to be
out by Thursday.

210
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,269
So between the paint,
the writing on the wall,

211
00:16:13,271 --> 00:16:14,437
the hardwood...

212
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:15,690
Whoa, what
writing on the wall?

213
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:16,606
In the guestroom.

214
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:17,607
There's crayon on the wall.

215
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,402
What, no, I was just in there.

216
00:16:19,404 --> 00:16:20,862
I didn't see anything.

217
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,284
I'm calling my
maintenance guy.

218
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:30,037
You will be here all day, right?

219
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,746
I don't like having
him here alone.

220
00:16:31,748 --> 00:16:32,999
Do I need to be?

221
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:34,833
I kinda have to be at
the new house by six.

222
00:16:34,835 --> 00:16:37,045
Yes, I'll have
him come at 6:30.

223
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:43,051
Oh God.

224
00:17:17,627 --> 00:17:18,669
Hello?

225
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:19,502
Anna!

226
00:17:19,504 --> 00:17:20,337
Oh my God, finally.

227
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,172
Uh...

228
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:22,008
Shit.

229
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:25,595
God!

230
00:18:19,857 --> 00:18:21,024
Somebody help!

231
00:19:53,742 --> 00:19:54,910
Somebody help!

232
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:01,708
Get me out!

233
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:04,670
Somebody help!

234
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,468
Let me out!

235
00:20:13,053 --> 00:20:15,055
Please, I can't breathe!

236
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,224
Help!

237
00:20:24,898 --> 00:20:25,899
Please help!

238
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:57,179
Barney's Pizza,
what can I get ya?

239
00:20:57,181 --> 00:20:58,221
What?

240
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,056
Hello?

241
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:00,223
No, I need help.

242
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:01,683
Wait a second,
you're the lady

243
00:21:01,685 --> 00:21:02,893
who didn't pay for her food!

244
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:03,894
What?

245
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:05,690
You know, I came
up short because of you.

246
00:21:08,776 --> 00:21:09,775
9-1-1, what's your emergency?

247
00:21:09,777 --> 00:21:11,027
Hello, hello, I need help.

248
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:13,403
My name is Anna Winter, I'm at...

249
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,404
Didn't your
mother teach you

250
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:15,865
not to hang up on people?

251
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:17,325
Listen, asshole!

252
00:21:17,327 --> 00:21:19,743
No, you
listen, you little bitch!

253
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:23,247
You deserve what's
coming to you.

254
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:24,749
Who is this?

255
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:26,791
Stay with me, Anna.

256
00:21:26,793 --> 00:21:29,586
Don't leave me
like you left Lex.

257
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,380
Lex almost killed me.

258
00:21:31,382 --> 00:21:33,089
It's
a shame he didn't.

259
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:36,095
My God!

260
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:52,444
Help!

261
00:22:03,164 --> 00:22:03,998
Help!

262
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:08,251
Help!

263
00:22:10,754 --> 00:22:15,423
Help!

264
00:22:15,425 --> 00:22:16,260
Help!

265
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:19,055
Help!

266
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:23,809
Help!

267
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:33,485
Somebody help.

268
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:35,863
Help!

269
00:22:36,947 --> 00:22:37,948
Oh my God.

270
00:22:39,575 --> 00:22:41,325
I didn't mean to.

271
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:42,242
What?

272
00:22:42,244 --> 00:22:43,160
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

273
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:45,162
You knew I'd relapse.

274
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:46,288
No, I'll go get help.

275
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,375
It's too late.

276
00:22:49,918 --> 00:22:51,669
You let this happen.

277
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:54,007
You survived this
before, you'll do it again.

278
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,968
Tell Lex I still love him.

279
00:22:59,803 --> 00:23:00,678
What did you just say?

280
00:23:37,675 --> 00:23:39,258
Shit.

281
00:24:03,158 --> 00:24:03,992
Oh my God.

282
00:24:05,036 --> 00:24:06,576
Lex, Lex!

283
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:07,871
Lex, over here!

284
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:10,955
Anna, I'm sorry.

285
00:24:10,957 --> 00:24:11,874
I just had to...

286
00:24:11,876 --> 00:24:13,667
Lex, get
me out of here.

287
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:14,501
What?

288
00:24:14,503 --> 00:24:16,505
I'm stuck, get me out!

289
00:24:18,007 --> 00:24:19,384
What do you want me to do?

290
00:24:20,385 --> 00:24:21,594
Smash the window.

291
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:36,816
Actually.

292
00:24:36,818 --> 00:24:37,985
Lex, please.

293
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:40,611
Why?

294
00:24:40,613 --> 00:24:42,195
Why?

295
00:24:42,197 --> 00:24:43,655
You never helped me.

296
00:24:43,657 --> 00:24:44,949
What are you talking about?

297
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:46,784
You hung me out to dry.

298
00:24:46,786 --> 00:24:47,993
What?

299
00:24:47,995 --> 00:24:50,621
Lex, now's not the time
to talk about this.

300
00:24:50,623 --> 00:24:52,789
I just got back
from rehab, Anna,

301
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,959
and they said you went
through with our divorce.

302
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:57,044
You left me behind,
you saved yourself,

303
00:24:57,046 --> 00:24:58,336
you destroyed our family.

304
00:24:58,338 --> 00:25:00,131
I did it for Claire!

305
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:01,673
You robbed her of her father!

306
00:25:01,675 --> 00:25:03,134
It was for her safety!

307
00:25:03,136 --> 00:25:04,719
Don't give me that bullshit.

308
00:25:04,721 --> 00:25:06,472
Like you weren't
popping pills too.

309
00:25:09,517 --> 00:25:10,351
Please.

310
00:25:13,021 --> 00:25:15,857
I can't wait
until you relapse.

311
00:25:19,902 --> 00:25:21,654
Lex, Lex, Lex, Lex!

312
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,541
Mrs. Winter?

313
00:26:17,835 --> 00:26:18,875
I'm here to fix the pipe.

314
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,086
Don't close the door!

315
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:24,050
Shit.

316
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:27,843
Wedge my toolbox in the door!

317
00:26:27,845 --> 00:26:28,805
It'll give me room!

318
00:26:31,683 --> 00:26:33,015
Ow, ow, no, pull me in.

319
00:26:33,017 --> 00:26:34,266
No, you don't want that.

320
00:26:34,268 --> 00:26:35,601
I know what I'm
doing, pull me in.

321
00:26:35,603 --> 00:26:36,852
No, I'm stuck in here!

322
00:26:36,854 --> 00:26:38,398
I know, it's the nun!

323
00:26:41,442 --> 00:26:42,857
God, are you okay?

324
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:44,234
I'm fine, I'm fine, you?

325
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:45,529
Yeah, I'm fine.

326
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,405
How long have you
been stuck here?

327
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:50,074
About an hour.

328
00:26:50,076 --> 00:26:51,659
I'm assuming you've
met Sister Catherine?

329
00:26:51,661 --> 00:26:53,576
Yeah, she's a real
bitch for a woman of God.

330
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:55,413
No, she's great!

331
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:58,415
Busted pipe?

332
00:26:58,417 --> 00:26:59,959
Apparently.

333
00:26:59,961 --> 00:27:00,835
I wish it were that easy.

334
00:27:00,837 --> 00:27:02,377
What is going on here?

335
00:27:02,379 --> 00:27:04,713
Yeah, well it's the nun,
she's trying to kill you.

336
00:27:04,715 --> 00:27:05,881
Yeah, no shit.

337
00:27:05,883 --> 00:27:07,758
Yeah, well her name's
Sister Catherine.

338
00:27:13,724 --> 00:27:15,266
Get out!

339
00:27:26,738 --> 00:27:27,572
Shit.

340
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:29,781
Go on!

341
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:32,785
Come on.

342
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:45,962
That won't help.

343
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,298
It's all we've got.

344
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,551
Well you've got your
strength and you're wasting it.

345
00:28:11,406 --> 00:28:12,241
K.K.

346
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:14,493
Anna.

347
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:17,869
I'm guessing you're
not really a mechanic?

348
00:28:17,871 --> 00:28:19,454
No, actually I am.

349
00:28:19,456 --> 00:28:21,374
I do all of Donna's houses.

350
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,959
It's actually how I
met Sister Catherine.

351
00:28:23,961 --> 00:28:26,961
She's tried to kill me
every time I come here.

352
00:28:26,963 --> 00:28:28,424
But you keep coming back?

353
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,092
Well, no one believes me,

354
00:28:31,094 --> 00:28:34,720
so might as well try
to prove her existence.

355
00:28:34,722 --> 00:28:35,556
Any luck?

356
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:37,724
Not yet.

357
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:39,977
But today looks promising.

358
00:28:41,396 --> 00:28:43,354
I just wanna get out of here.

359
00:28:43,356 --> 00:28:44,188
Hey, don't worry.

360
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,191
That's the easy part.

361
00:28:47,443 --> 00:28:49,362
Her name is Sister
Margaret Catherine.

362
00:28:52,406 --> 00:28:54,533
She's a ghost now, obviously.

363
00:28:55,702 --> 00:28:58,618
Well, she thinks
she's in purgatory,

364
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,163
and over 100 years ago this
place used to be a convent.

365
00:29:02,165 --> 00:29:03,624
You know, a holy land.

366
00:29:03,626 --> 00:29:05,667
Well she's convinced
herself that she

367
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:07,586
needs to protect this
land to prove herself

368
00:29:07,588 --> 00:29:09,380
to God to get into heaven.

369
00:29:09,382 --> 00:29:10,548
Whoop!

370
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:13,174
But if she thinks
you're a threat to that,

371
00:29:13,176 --> 00:29:16,761
well she'll chase you
away, or kill you.

372
00:29:16,763 --> 00:29:18,556
I think she's
taking the kill route.

373
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:19,434
Yeah, me too.

374
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,560
It's a textbook
haunting, really.

375
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:25,895
You know, a tortured
soul can't rest

376
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:27,897
in peace after an
untimely death.

377
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:29,359
I've seen it a million times.

378
00:29:32,488 --> 00:29:34,029
Wanna see how she died?

379
00:29:34,031 --> 00:29:34,866
Yeah.

380
00:29:37,534 --> 00:29:39,745
I threw up the
first time I saw it.

381
00:29:40,788 --> 00:29:41,912
Oh my God.

382
00:30:06,606 --> 00:30:07,771
Wait, no.

383
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:09,981
Throw something first.

384
00:30:09,983 --> 00:30:10,859
Uh.

385
00:30:14,405 --> 00:30:15,781
Something small.

386
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,766
Should have seen that coming.

387
00:30:43,768 --> 00:30:46,644
God, I have hallucinating
like this since she showed up.

388
00:30:46,646 --> 00:30:48,104
That's just her physical form.

389
00:30:48,106 --> 00:30:50,897
It's how she moves around,
it's how she gives you visions,

390
00:30:50,899 --> 00:30:52,859
it's how she messes
with the damn pipes.

391
00:30:54,404 --> 00:30:55,819
Have you ever seen
the movie Ghost?

392
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:56,778
Oh my God, that's
like my favorite movie!

393
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,029
Great.

394
00:30:58,031 --> 00:30:59,490
So you know how it
takes Patrick Swayze

395
00:30:59,492 --> 00:31:01,282
a ton of energy to move
around in the physical world?

396
00:31:01,284 --> 00:31:02,159
Well yeah, okay, it's like...

397
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:03,451
Exactly.

398
00:31:03,453 --> 00:31:04,787
So what we need to
do is wear her out

399
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:07,123
so she won't be able to
use that physical form,

400
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:09,126
and then we can get
the hell outta here.

401
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:13,006
Follow me.

402
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:21,554
Okay, it is June 17th.

403
00:31:21,556 --> 00:31:23,263
I'm here with Anna
Winter attempting

404
00:31:23,265 --> 00:31:24,766
to speak to Sister Catherine.

405
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:30,354
Okay, that's an EMF reader.

406
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:32,856
The higher it gets,
the closer she is.

407
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:34,692
And if it passes
five milliguass,

408
00:31:34,694 --> 00:31:36,945
it'll beep and we're fucked.

409
00:31:43,036 --> 00:31:43,995
You're kidding.

410
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:47,038
What?

411
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,873
That's a toy!

412
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:49,834
Well so is Chucky.

413
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,916
It doesn't matter.

414
00:31:51,918 --> 00:31:53,294
Well does it work?

415
00:31:53,296 --> 00:31:54,963
No, I put it out
for decoration.

416
00:31:57,383 --> 00:31:58,217
Yes, it works.

417
00:32:02,722 --> 00:32:05,058
Okay, so if anything
happens, use this.

418
00:32:06,684 --> 00:32:07,682
It's a pentagram.

419
00:32:07,684 --> 00:32:09,769
Sometimes it scares her away.

420
00:32:09,771 --> 00:32:11,938
Most times it'll
just piss her off.

421
00:32:24,117 --> 00:32:29,123
Sister Catherine, Anna and
I are here to apologize.

422
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:37,421
I am not a threat
and I wanna leave.

423
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,258
Nope, nope, screw that.

424
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:41,384
No, no, no, no, no,
please stay, please stay.

425
00:32:41,386 --> 00:32:43,094
That's normal, that's normal.

426
00:32:43,096 --> 00:32:44,888
She's a little stubborn.

427
00:32:49,644 --> 00:32:50,478
Stay.

428
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:56,275
Protect?

429
00:32:58,235 --> 00:33:02,779
Stay.

430
00:33:02,781 --> 00:33:03,864
What?

431
00:33:03,866 --> 00:33:05,782
Stay.

432
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:06,952
What?

433
00:33:08,078 --> 00:33:10,248
Stay.

434
00:33:19,924 --> 00:33:21,466
Stay with me, Anna.

435
00:33:24,928 --> 00:33:26,513
It's my time to go.

436
00:33:28,598 --> 00:33:31,519
You must take my place.

437
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:35,604
Sister, you don't want me.

438
00:33:35,606 --> 00:33:37,147
I'm...

439
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:39,109
Your
life is not worth living.

440
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:41,154
You're strong.

441
00:33:42,363 --> 00:33:45,990
Replace me as I
ascend into heaven.

442
00:33:45,992 --> 00:33:47,159
No, I won't!

443
00:33:48,368 --> 00:33:51,539
Then I'll force you!

444
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,417
Pick it up!

445
00:33:56,961 --> 00:33:58,338
What'd she say?

446
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:20,982
What'd you see?

447
00:34:50,347 --> 00:34:51,515
Anna!

448
00:34:52,475 --> 00:34:53,309
K.K.?

449
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:55,895
K.K., I'm coming!

450
00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:02,316
K.K.?

451
00:35:02,318 --> 00:35:03,151
I'm in here.

452
00:35:08,908 --> 00:35:10,950
I should
have done something.

453
00:35:10,952 --> 00:35:12,412
It was her own fault.

454
00:35:13,662 --> 00:35:15,914
She was always
so scared of relapse.

455
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,834
There was nothing
you could have done.

456
00:35:20,002 --> 00:35:21,419
What about Claire?

457
00:35:21,421 --> 00:35:23,962
What about her?

458
00:35:23,964 --> 00:35:26,756
She's your daughter.

459
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:28,341
It doesn't feel like it.

460
00:35:28,343 --> 00:35:30,095
I haven't seen her
since the split.

461
00:35:31,555 --> 00:35:33,930
Anna kept her away from you
with that restraining order.

462
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:36,935
I know, and I
resent her for that.

463
00:35:37,937 --> 00:35:39,145
I don't blame you.

464
00:35:39,147 --> 00:35:40,898
He was dangerous.

465
00:35:42,399 --> 00:35:43,608
And so were you.

466
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:48,446
I didn't do anything to you.

467
00:35:48,448 --> 00:35:50,116
Then why are you so guilty?

468
00:35:51,158 --> 00:35:52,660
She never could get past it.

469
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:56,539
Do you still love me?

470
00:35:58,457 --> 00:36:00,082
Do you still love him?

471
00:36:00,084 --> 00:36:01,792
Mike, I...

472
00:36:01,794 --> 00:36:03,877
After everything
he did to you?

473
00:36:03,879 --> 00:36:05,962
Mike, please!

474
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:07,048
Come here.

475
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,301
Get away from me.

476
00:36:10,303 --> 00:36:12,013
Stay with me, Anna.

477
00:36:27,778 --> 00:36:29,153
Why?

478
00:36:29,155 --> 00:36:32,325
Tell my mom I miss
her and I love her.

479
00:36:34,827 --> 00:36:39,832
Tell her my noose, and
I'm skipping 5th grade.

480
00:36:42,042 --> 00:36:44,334
Ask her what she did.

481
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:45,713
It's an accident.

482
00:36:47,673 --> 00:36:48,506
Mom?

483
00:36:48,508 --> 00:36:49,341
Oh baby!

484
00:36:53,638 --> 00:36:55,640
What are you doing here?

485
00:36:57,225 --> 00:36:58,559
We moved back.

486
00:37:00,687 --> 00:37:02,727
Are you a ghost?

487
00:37:02,729 --> 00:37:03,687
What?

488
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:05,397
No, no, of course not, no.

489
00:37:05,399 --> 00:37:08,859
Why would you ask
me that, honey?

490
00:37:08,861 --> 00:37:11,614
You never came
to the new home.

491
00:37:13,783 --> 00:37:15,866
They found you in the hallway.

492
00:37:15,868 --> 00:37:16,703
Help.

493
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,455
Somebody please, help.

494
00:37:22,542 --> 00:37:24,082
Am I dead?

495
00:37:24,084 --> 00:37:25,250
Yes.

496
00:37:25,252 --> 00:37:27,712
But Dad said ghosts aren't real.

497
00:37:27,714 --> 00:37:29,714
He's wrong, honey.

498
00:37:29,716 --> 00:37:30,883
He's so wrong.

499
00:37:49,609 --> 00:37:51,445
She wants you to go.

500
00:37:54,573 --> 00:37:57,408
She's here to take
you to heaven.

501
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:58,993
Who?

502
00:37:58,995 --> 00:38:01,287
Your guardian angel.

503
00:38:01,289 --> 00:38:02,622
Sister Catherine.

504
00:38:04,374 --> 00:38:06,209
She says you won't go.

505
00:38:13,426 --> 00:38:15,261
Are you with me. Mama?

506
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:18,763
I'm not going anywhere, Baby.

507
00:38:18,765 --> 00:38:20,263
I'll be right here.

508
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:21,098
I'll stay.

509
00:38:36,615 --> 00:38:37,449
Shit.

510
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:45,290
One, two, three.

511
00:38:46,292 --> 00:38:47,126
Shit.

512
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:03,473
Nice try, bitch.

513
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,475
Anna!

514
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:07,812
K.K., where are you?

515
00:39:07,814 --> 00:39:09,270
In the attic!

516
00:39:09,272 --> 00:39:10,316
I'm coming!

517
00:39:13,986 --> 00:39:15,194
K.K.?

518
00:39:15,196 --> 00:39:16,364
I'm up here!

519
00:39:25,832 --> 00:39:26,830
'Sup?

520
00:39:26,832 --> 00:39:28,499
How did you get up here?

521
00:39:28,501 --> 00:39:30,167
I don't know, I
just woke up here

522
00:39:30,169 --> 00:39:32,294
after you used the pentagram.

523
00:39:32,296 --> 00:39:33,504
My bad.

524
00:39:33,506 --> 00:39:35,633
It's part of, it's
part of the job.

525
00:39:37,176 --> 00:39:38,508
Are you okay?

526
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,884
Oh, I'll be fine.

527
00:39:39,886 --> 00:39:42,557
She just, she chewed
up my leg a little bit.

528
00:39:43,515 --> 00:39:44,848
What happened?

529
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,392
I have no idea.

530
00:39:46,394 --> 00:39:48,977
I had another one of those
silly hallucinations.

531
00:39:48,979 --> 00:39:50,937
I think I saw my mom.

532
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:52,649
God, those visions
are too real.

533
00:39:54,568 --> 00:39:55,402
Anna.

534
00:39:58,406 --> 00:40:01,701
Stay with me, Anna.

535
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,709
Can you hear her?

536
00:40:11,669 --> 00:40:12,670
No.

537
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:17,175
I think she's gone.

538
00:40:19,843 --> 00:40:20,759
Anna, help!

539
00:40:20,761 --> 00:40:22,011
Oh my God, K.K.!

540
00:40:22,013 --> 00:40:23,136
Don't listen
to her, I'm right here!

541
00:40:23,138 --> 00:40:25,430
Anna, I'm right over here!

542
00:40:25,432 --> 00:40:26,307
I need help!

543
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:27,183
K.K., I'm coming.

544
00:40:27,185 --> 00:40:28,183
Don't.

545
00:40:28,185 --> 00:40:30,185
You're gonna get
yourself killed.

546
00:40:30,187 --> 00:40:31,604
Anna, I can see her.

547
00:40:31,606 --> 00:40:32,854
I have to do something.

548
00:40:32,856 --> 00:40:34,774
She's behind
you, Anna, run!

549
00:40:34,776 --> 00:40:35,691
I'm opening the door!

550
00:40:35,693 --> 00:40:36,901
No!

551
00:40:42,992 --> 00:40:44,908
Come on, we have to get help.

552
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,078
We have to go.

553
00:40:48,664 --> 00:40:49,622
Give me your hand.

554
00:40:49,624 --> 00:40:50,580
Give me your hand, come on.

555
00:40:50,582 --> 00:40:51,501
Come on.

556
00:40:56,923 --> 00:40:58,131
Sit right here.

557
00:41:02,886 --> 00:41:05,097
Okay, just keep
pressure on it, okay?

558
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,227
Or do that, okay.

559
00:41:12,604 --> 00:41:14,270
Oh God.

560
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:16,399
Just hold that there.

561
00:41:16,401 --> 00:41:17,857
Keep pressure on it, okay?

562
00:41:17,859 --> 00:41:19,986
Just keep pressure on it.

563
00:41:19,988 --> 00:41:21,236
I'm not gonna make it.

564
00:41:21,238 --> 00:41:23,281
Yes you are, just
keep holding it down!

565
00:41:27,995 --> 00:41:28,829
Okay.

566
00:41:30,122 --> 00:41:32,247
Hey, Anna, hey, hey,
hey, keep talking to me.

567
00:41:32,249 --> 00:41:33,874
Keep talking to me.

568
00:41:33,876 --> 00:41:36,459
I've been through
a lot of shit.

569
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:38,962
But killer nun is not
how I expected to go.

570
00:41:38,964 --> 00:41:41,050
You're not gonna go, you're
gonna make it through this.

571
00:41:43,303 --> 00:41:45,054
Sorry you didn't
get your proof.

572
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,471
We're walkin' proof.

573
00:41:51,144 --> 00:41:52,810
Holy shit.

574
00:41:55,314 --> 00:41:56,147
Come on, let's go!

575
00:41:56,149 --> 00:41:57,605
Let's go!

576
00:41:57,607 --> 00:41:58,776
Let's go, you can do it!

577
00:42:00,486 --> 00:42:01,988
Let's just get down the steps.

578
00:42:08,243 --> 00:42:09,075
Donna!

579
00:42:09,077 --> 00:42:09,953
Donna, open the door!

580
00:42:13,332 --> 00:42:14,959
That stupid kid.

581
00:42:18,254 --> 00:42:19,962
Donna, you bitch,
open the door!

582
00:42:19,964 --> 00:42:20,798
Let us out!

583
00:42:26,011 --> 00:42:27,178
Come on.

584
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,307
Donna, you bitch,
open the goddamn door!

585
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:32,310
I don't have time for this.

586
00:42:35,229 --> 00:42:38,605
She can't.

587
00:42:38,607 --> 00:42:40,649
She can't hear us.

588
00:42:40,651 --> 00:42:44,278
Hey, hey, our only chance is
if she actually opens the door.

589
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,196
Okay?

590
00:42:45,198 --> 00:42:46,863
What happens if she doesn't?

591
00:42:46,865 --> 00:42:48,325
Don't go, Anna!

592
00:42:56,834 --> 00:42:58,125
No, Anna, come on!

593
00:42:58,127 --> 00:43:00,461
Come on, stay with
me, Anna, come on!

594
00:43:00,463 --> 00:43:01,589
You're home.

595
00:43:05,051 --> 00:43:06,383
Come on, stay up,
Anna, don't lose.

596
00:43:06,385 --> 00:43:07,219
Come on!

597
00:43:10,973 --> 00:43:13,140
I'm sorry, Anna.

598
00:43:13,142 --> 00:43:13,977
I'm sorry.

599
00:43:17,897 --> 00:43:20,066
He better not be
screwin' that goth chick.

600
00:43:22,568 --> 00:43:23,651
Kenneth, where...

601
00:43:25,738 --> 00:43:26,571
Anna!

602
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,787
Oh my God, this
better not be my blood!

603
00:43:35,414 --> 00:43:37,330
Hey, hey, we're gonna be okay.

604
00:43:37,332 --> 00:43:38,540
We got out.

605
00:43:38,542 --> 00:43:40,250
We're gonna get you some help.

606
00:43:40,252 --> 00:43:41,627
I'm not gonna be ready

607
00:43:41,629 --> 00:43:43,169
to show the house
because of this.

608
00:43:43,171 --> 00:43:44,587
Look at this, look
at this blood!

609
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:46,756
Donna, Donna,.

610
00:43:53,098 --> 00:43:56,433
Is she gonna be okay?

611
00:43:56,435 --> 00:44:00,729
I don't know, we just
have to wait and see.

612
00:44:00,731 --> 00:44:02,732
Code blue, room 305.

613
00:44:09,448 --> 00:44:11,448
I love you, Anna.

614
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:12,617
I always will.

615
00:44:14,537 --> 00:44:18,374
All doctors to the E.R.

616
00:44:46,109 --> 00:44:46,941
Hi.

617
00:44:46,943 --> 00:44:47,984
Hi there.

618
00:44:47,986 --> 00:44:49,153
Sleep okay?

619
00:44:49,155 --> 00:44:50,779
Mhmm.

620
00:44:50,781 --> 00:44:53,823
First good sleep in a while.

621
00:44:53,825 --> 00:44:55,825
Claire's still
at her sleepover.

622
00:44:55,827 --> 00:44:56,745
Wanna go somewhere?

623
00:44:57,830 --> 00:44:58,665
Yeah.

624
00:45:03,086 --> 00:45:04,000
Hop to it, then.

625
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:04,836
Okay.

626
00:45:14,638 --> 00:45:15,597
How's it looking?

627
00:45:16,682 --> 00:45:17,516
Better.

628
00:45:18,517 --> 00:45:20,058
Does it still hurt?

629
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:21,396
No, it's just sore.

630
00:45:23,022 --> 00:45:25,439
Still don't remember anything?

631
00:45:25,441 --> 00:45:26,899
No.

632
00:45:26,901 --> 00:45:29,569
The last thing
that I remember is,

633
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,365
I guess picking up
the moving truck.

634
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,700
Wow.

635
00:45:36,702 --> 00:45:37,660
Honestly, though,
I don't think

636
00:45:37,662 --> 00:45:39,620
I wanna remember being stabbed.

637
00:45:41,332 --> 00:45:42,500
That's fair.

638
00:45:43,667 --> 00:45:46,669
You know that other guy, K.K.,

639
00:45:46,671 --> 00:45:48,879
he doesn't remember
anything either.

640
00:45:48,881 --> 00:45:51,048
I still think he
could be a suspect.

641
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:55,305
Yeah well, we'll let the
police worry about that.

642
00:46:08,734 --> 00:46:10,317
Doctor Palmer gave you these?

643
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:11,401
Yeah.

644
00:46:11,403 --> 00:46:12,236
But they're...

645
00:46:12,238 --> 00:46:13,071
I know.

646
00:46:14,406 --> 00:46:16,365
Does he think that's safe?

647
00:46:16,367 --> 00:46:18,995
Well, all the other
medicines made me sick.

648
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,370
But I think I'll be fine

649
00:46:21,372 --> 00:46:22,955
as long as we keep an eye on it.

650
00:46:22,957 --> 00:46:24,415
As long as you feel safe.

651
00:46:24,417 --> 00:46:25,251
I do.

652
00:46:27,002 --> 00:46:28,046
I can handle it, now.

653
00:46:29,546 --> 00:46:31,714
This has really changed you.

654
00:46:31,716 --> 00:46:34,049
Yeah, most near-death
experiences do.

655
00:46:34,051 --> 00:46:34,885
True.

656
00:46:37,847 --> 00:46:40,640
It's not a bad change, is it?

657
00:46:40,642 --> 00:46:42,268
No, not at all.

658
00:46:43,102 --> 00:46:46,606
You just feel peaceful.

659
00:46:48,774 --> 00:46:50,108
Well that's a good word.

660
00:46:51,193 --> 00:46:52,027
Peaceful.

661
00:47:04,707 --> 00:47:06,082
I don't even know how to shop.

662
00:47:08,669 --> 00:47:11,088
I wear like the same
10 black t-shirts.

663
00:47:12,256 --> 00:47:13,546
That makes it easy.

664
00:47:13,548 --> 00:47:16,341
You just pick anything, though.

665
00:47:24,185 --> 00:47:25,311
That's different.

666
00:47:33,443 --> 00:47:35,986
Wow.

667
00:47:35,988 --> 00:47:37,363
Good wow or bad wow?

668
00:47:37,365 --> 00:47:38,948
Good wow.

669
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:40,281
You look amazing.

670
00:47:40,283 --> 00:47:41,491
Thanks!

671
00:47:41,493 --> 00:47:44,328
Honestly, I am surprised
at how much I like it.

672
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:45,830
I think this is the first time

673
00:47:45,832 --> 00:47:48,915
I've seen you wearing not black.

674
00:47:59,345 --> 00:48:03,180
I hope you're not doing this
because you think I like it.

675
00:48:03,182 --> 00:48:04,017
No, I want to.

676
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:06,685
I'm shocked, frankly.

677
00:48:08,521 --> 00:48:09,770
I wanna move on.

678
00:48:09,772 --> 00:48:11,357
I wanna leave the old me behind.

679
00:48:12,899 --> 00:48:14,566
I'm proud of you.

680
00:48:14,568 --> 00:48:15,817
Thanks.

681
00:48:15,819 --> 00:48:17,861
I'm not ditching the
attitude, though.

682
00:48:17,863 --> 00:48:19,321
I wouldn't want you to.

683
00:48:24,537 --> 00:48:25,910
One sec.

684
00:48:25,912 --> 00:48:26,747
Yeah.

685
00:48:34,213 --> 00:48:36,004
Hey, Anna, it's Lex.

686
00:48:36,006 --> 00:48:37,548
Call me.

687
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:39,716
I heard you and Mike finally
moved out of his aunt's house.

688
00:48:39,718 --> 00:48:42,179
I was thinking about
stopping by later.

689
00:48:43,347 --> 00:48:45,390
I'm getting cleaned
up, you know, and uh.

690
00:48:51,647 --> 00:48:53,855
Hey Mike, we should get
one of these for Claire.

691
00:48:53,857 --> 00:48:54,982
What is it?

692
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:08,537
Well look at you!

693
00:49:08,539 --> 00:49:10,205
You're not all
brains, after all!

694
00:49:10,207 --> 00:49:11,165
Nope.

695
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,082
You still thinking about going

696
00:49:12,084 --> 00:49:13,750
out for basketball next year?

697
00:49:13,752 --> 00:49:14,794
Yeah.
Yeah?

698
00:49:14,796 --> 00:49:16,044
Gosh, I still can't believe

699
00:49:16,046 --> 00:49:17,754
that they let you
skip 5th grade.

700
00:49:17,756 --> 00:49:19,714
I'm excited for middle school

701
00:49:19,716 --> 00:49:21,383
Nobody should be
excited for middle school.

702
00:49:21,385 --> 00:49:22,884
Hey!
Dad!

703
00:49:22,886 --> 00:49:25,220
It's true!

704
00:49:25,222 --> 00:49:26,471
Ooh, pizza!

705
00:49:26,473 --> 00:49:27,307
I'll get it.

706
00:49:31,854 --> 00:49:33,604
Hey, 21.09.

707
00:49:33,606 --> 00:49:34,899
Here you are.

708
00:49:36,651 --> 00:49:37,482
Here you go.

709
00:49:37,484 --> 00:49:38,316
Thanks.

710
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:39,152
Yeah, have a good night.

711
00:49:43,115 --> 00:49:43,949
Hey wait!

712
00:49:45,618 --> 00:49:48,621
21.09, you gave me 21.06.

713
00:49:50,414 --> 00:49:51,999
It's three cents.

714
00:49:55,836 --> 00:49:57,546
I don't have three cents.

715
00:50:02,593 --> 00:50:04,846
I'm sorry, that's all I got.

716
00:50:13,729 --> 00:50:14,562
I'm so excited.

717
00:50:14,564 --> 00:50:15,812
Yes!

718
00:50:15,814 --> 00:50:16,939
Thank you.

719
00:50:16,941 --> 00:50:19,024
Can I have the first slice?

720
00:50:19,026 --> 00:50:19,984
Only if you hold it.

721
00:50:19,986 --> 00:50:20,901
'Kay.

722
00:50:20,903 --> 00:50:21,863
I'm gonna go get plates.

723
00:50:24,156 --> 00:50:24,990
What?

724
00:50:26,075 --> 00:50:26,908
Deja vu.

725
00:50:28,368 --> 00:50:30,076
We had pizza in
the moving truck.

726
00:50:30,078 --> 00:50:31,414
That's probably what it is.

727
00:50:32,874 --> 00:50:33,707
Yeah.

728
00:50:59,399 --> 00:51:00,441
Hey Mike?

729
00:51:00,443 --> 00:51:01,691
What?

730
00:51:01,693 --> 00:51:04,655
Did I take my pills
earlier in the car?

731
00:51:05,573 --> 00:51:06,613
I don't think so.

732
00:51:06,615 --> 00:51:07,906
You sure?

733
00:51:07,908 --> 00:51:08,867
Positive.

734
00:51:23,883 --> 00:51:26,551
Who was that that
called earlier?

735
00:51:28,053 --> 00:51:30,973
Mmm, it was, uh, the doctor.

736
00:51:32,182 --> 00:51:33,432
Everything okay?

737
00:51:33,434 --> 00:51:35,519
Yeah, yeah, no, he was
just checking up on me.

738
00:51:38,064 --> 00:51:38,897
Good.

739
00:51:56,415 --> 00:51:57,622
You forgot this.

740
00:51:57,624 --> 00:51:58,582
No, I didn't.

741
00:51:58,584 --> 00:52:00,042
I took one in the bathroom.

742
00:52:00,044 --> 00:52:01,127
When I was in there?

743
00:52:01,129 --> 00:52:02,086
Yeah, I asked you.

744
00:52:02,088 --> 00:52:03,879
No you didn't.

745
00:52:03,881 --> 00:52:05,423
I swear I did, and if not,

746
00:52:05,425 --> 00:52:07,966
then I definitely
took one in the car.

747
00:52:07,968 --> 00:52:09,177
Take it just in case.

748
00:52:10,345 --> 00:52:11,511
I'll take it first
thing in the morning.

749
00:52:11,513 --> 00:52:13,098
I think you
should take it now.

750
00:52:16,644 --> 00:52:18,271
I'm going to bed.

751
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:26,696
Anna, take it.

752
00:52:29,615 --> 00:52:33,118
Michael, you never
talk to me like this.

753
00:52:34,495 --> 00:52:35,747
Take it, now.

754
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:00,312
Hey, baby, are you okay?

755
00:53:03,066 --> 00:53:05,191
I took too many
of those pills.

756
00:53:05,193 --> 00:53:06,651
I screwed up.

757
00:53:06,653 --> 00:53:07,611
Can you forgive me.

758
00:53:08,821 --> 00:53:11,154
Can we talk about
this in the morning?

759
00:53:11,156 --> 00:53:12,325
Sure.

760
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:15,369
Here, this will help
you feel better.

761
00:53:16,537 --> 00:53:18,037
What is it?

762
00:53:18,039 --> 00:53:19,707
From when I
had my stomach flu.

763
00:53:22,459 --> 00:53:23,627
Mike, that's mine.

764
00:53:24,836 --> 00:53:26,087
I don't know what you're...

765
00:53:26,089 --> 00:53:27,296
What are
you talking about?

766
00:53:27,298 --> 00:53:28,883
Get that away from me!

767
00:53:33,388 --> 00:53:34,970
I wouldn't
do that to you.

768
00:53:34,972 --> 00:53:36,430
I'm not taking it!

769
00:53:36,432 --> 00:53:37,515
But...

770
00:53:37,517 --> 00:53:38,685
I said no!

771
00:53:40,687 --> 00:53:41,854
Fine.

772
00:54:37,577 --> 00:54:38,410
Lex.

773
00:54:39,703 --> 00:54:42,457
Um, I was just about to leave.

774
00:54:44,542 --> 00:54:46,294
I thought that
maybe we could talk.

775
00:54:48,254 --> 00:54:49,964
I don't think
that's a good idea.

776
00:54:51,381 --> 00:54:54,049
Anna, I just wanna talk
to you one more time.

777
00:54:54,051 --> 00:54:55,928
I really gotta go, I'm sorry.

778
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:00,013
Don't wreck this.

779
00:55:00,015 --> 00:55:00,849
Lex, please.

780
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:06,814
Anna, I need to
tell ya something.

781
00:55:07,939 --> 00:55:10,691
You're breaking the
restraining order.

782
00:55:10,693 --> 00:55:11,611
I still love you.

783
00:55:12,528 --> 00:55:13,736
I'm calling the cops.

784
00:55:13,738 --> 00:55:15,111
And I know that you
still love me too!

785
00:55:15,113 --> 00:55:15,988
I mean it!

786
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:17,367
Stay with me, Anna.

787
00:55:29,671 --> 00:55:30,504
I'll shoot.

788
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,885
You're worth dyin' for.

789
00:55:43,267 --> 00:55:45,308
Go on, hmm?

790
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:46,144
Do it.

791
00:55:47,021 --> 00:55:48,604
Hmm?

792
00:55:48,606 --> 00:55:49,691
Go on, do it.

793
00:55:51,316 --> 00:55:52,150
Do it!

794
00:55:54,236 --> 00:55:55,736
Ah!

795
00:55:55,738 --> 00:55:57,323
Jesus Christ,
all right, all right!

796
00:56:12,296 --> 00:56:13,131
Nothing?

797
00:56:15,008 --> 00:56:16,256
Nothing.

798
00:56:16,258 --> 00:56:17,718
No flashes or anything?

799
00:56:20,513 --> 00:56:23,348
The only thing I remember
is the name Sister Catherine.

800
00:56:27,394 --> 00:56:30,897
Okay, well, does
this ring a bell?

801
00:56:32,566 --> 00:56:34,024
That's mine.

802
00:56:34,026 --> 00:56:37,236
Yeah, and I remember
you telling me to use that

803
00:56:37,238 --> 00:56:40,531
in case of an emergency and
putting it in my pocket.

804
00:56:40,533 --> 00:56:42,741
I bought this on a
ghost hunting project.

805
00:56:42,743 --> 00:56:43,577
Ghost hunting?

806
00:56:45,037 --> 00:56:48,163
Um, it's a hobby of mine.

807
00:56:48,165 --> 00:56:50,457
Okay, well we must have been

808
00:56:50,459 --> 00:56:52,625
messing with it in
that rental house.

809
00:56:52,627 --> 00:56:53,877
Doubt it.

810
00:56:53,879 --> 00:56:55,379
I mean, I fixed some
pipes there once,

811
00:56:55,381 --> 00:56:56,796
and I thought there might be
something paranormal going on,

812
00:56:56,798 --> 00:56:58,716
but that was really it.

813
00:56:58,718 --> 00:57:00,759
Okay, then how did
I end up with this?

814
00:57:00,761 --> 00:57:01,595
Does it matter?

815
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,723
Look, strange stuff has been
happening at my house, okay?

816
00:57:06,725 --> 00:57:07,975
And I think that
it has something

817
00:57:07,977 --> 00:57:09,894
to do with what
happened that day.

818
00:57:09,896 --> 00:57:11,770
No, you're crazy.

819
00:57:11,772 --> 00:57:12,729
K.K., please.

820
00:57:12,731 --> 00:57:14,147
No, no.

821
00:57:14,149 --> 00:57:15,607
Anna, I really don't
have time for this, okay?

822
00:57:15,609 --> 00:57:17,984
Okay, we need to find
out what happened that day.

823
00:57:17,986 --> 00:57:19,321
It's over, Anna.

824
00:57:21,658 --> 00:57:22,617
You gotta move on.

825
00:57:42,428 --> 00:57:45,095
What the hell is this?

826
00:57:45,097 --> 00:57:46,680
My medication?

827
00:57:46,682 --> 00:57:48,559
Yeah, why are they all gone?

828
00:57:50,519 --> 00:57:51,935
I haven't touched them.

829
00:57:51,937 --> 00:57:52,939
Don't bullshit me.

830
00:57:53,856 --> 00:57:55,064
You're hooked.

831
00:57:55,066 --> 00:57:56,272
Mike, I swear to God,

832
00:57:56,274 --> 00:57:58,274
I haven't taken one
since I got sick!

833
00:57:58,276 --> 00:57:59,567
How could you do this?

834
00:57:59,569 --> 00:58:00,903
Do you want a repeat of
what happened with Lex?

835
00:58:00,905 --> 00:58:02,488
I didn't take them!

836
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:03,363
You're lying.

837
00:58:03,365 --> 00:58:04,198
Where are you going?

838
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,201
Oh my God!

839
00:58:09,372 --> 00:58:10,705
Everything okay?

840
00:58:10,707 --> 00:58:12,330
Get away from me!

841
00:58:23,218 --> 00:58:24,426
Hey baby, come with
mom.

842
00:58:24,428 --> 00:58:25,343
Mom?

843
00:58:25,345 --> 00:58:28,096
Come, come, come, okay.

844
00:58:28,098 --> 00:58:28,930
Mom!

845
00:58:28,932 --> 00:58:31,142
No, no, no, no.

846
00:58:33,729 --> 00:58:34,563
Go!

847
00:58:40,903 --> 00:58:41,736
You okay?

848
00:58:41,738 --> 00:58:43,071
Yeah.

849
00:58:45,615 --> 00:58:46,448
Anna, let me in.

850
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:47,700
Go away!

851
00:58:47,702 --> 00:58:49,701
I'm serious,
something's going on.

852
00:58:49,703 --> 00:58:51,162
I can't trust you!

853
00:58:51,164 --> 00:58:52,622
Lex is in the house.

854
00:58:53,665 --> 00:58:54,622
Daddy!

855
00:58:54,624 --> 00:58:56,834
Don't you call him that!

856
00:58:56,836 --> 00:58:57,919
Give me my daughter!

857
00:59:03,258 --> 00:59:06,595
Stay with me, Anna.

858
00:59:08,765 --> 00:59:10,138
Sister Catherine?

859
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:13,142
Leave this life behind.

860
00:59:13,144 --> 00:59:14,517
What did you do to Mike?

861
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:16,354
Mike's gone.

862
00:59:16,356 --> 00:59:19,107
Next I take you
or your daughter.

863
00:59:21,568 --> 00:59:25,529
You don't want this
life, this struggle.

864
00:59:25,531 --> 00:59:28,616
The past will never leave you.

865
00:59:28,618 --> 00:59:33,623
The addiction, the
abuse, it all comes back.

866
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:36,209
You've seen it first hand.

867
00:59:37,834 --> 00:59:39,711
It's you or the girl.

868
00:59:57,479 --> 00:59:59,231
No, no, no, don't
die, don't die.

869
01:00:04,903 --> 01:00:06,194
K.K.?

870
01:00:06,196 --> 01:00:10,281
Yeah, yeah it's
me, there you go.

871
01:00:10,283 --> 01:00:11,241
Where am I?

872
01:00:11,243 --> 01:00:12,701
You're in the bathroom.

873
01:00:12,703 --> 01:00:14,578
You got hurt in the attic.

874
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:15,456
I was stabbed.

875
01:00:16,749 --> 01:00:17,582
Yeah.

876
01:00:19,961 --> 01:00:22,461
Okay, in the rental house.

877
01:00:22,463 --> 01:00:23,839
This is the rental house.

878
01:00:26,591 --> 01:00:28,010
No, no, no, no.

879
01:00:29,761 --> 01:00:31,386
No, I was out.

880
01:00:31,388 --> 01:00:32,305
What are you talking about?

881
01:00:32,307 --> 01:00:33,138
What do you mean?

882
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:33,974
No, no.

883
01:00:34,892 --> 01:00:36,933
No, I was out!

884
01:00:36,935 --> 01:00:37,769
Shit, no!

885
01:00:40,272 --> 01:00:41,104
You're gonna make it worse.

886
01:00:42,941 --> 01:00:43,774
You're just gonna make it worse.

887
01:00:43,776 --> 01:00:45,026
Come on.

888
01:00:45,028 --> 01:00:46,401
I was out.

889
01:00:55,537 --> 01:00:58,788
What the hell are
you talking about?

890
01:00:58,790 --> 01:00:59,834
I was out, K.K.

891
01:01:02,336 --> 01:01:05,130
Oh God, it had
been three months.

892
01:01:07,466 --> 01:01:12,472
And I was in the new house,
and I saw her, her face,

893
01:01:15,807 --> 01:01:17,351
and she looked.

894
01:01:18,769 --> 01:01:21,521
She's losing, she's
losing her physical form.

895
01:01:22,981 --> 01:01:24,899
Oh my God, I've read about this.

896
01:01:24,901 --> 01:01:27,484
I never thought I'd
actually see it though.

897
01:01:27,486 --> 01:01:29,071
She listens to us.

898
01:01:31,031 --> 01:01:33,200
Maybe that's where
she gets the visions.

899
01:01:34,618 --> 01:01:36,328
I think I know what to do.

900
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:39,165
Follow my lead, okay?

901
01:01:43,836 --> 01:01:45,171
We need to get out of here!

902
01:01:49,841 --> 01:01:51,426
No, there's no way!

903
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:54,180
We'll go through the attic.

904
01:01:55,305 --> 01:01:58,182
The fan in the attic.

905
01:01:58,184 --> 01:02:00,850
We could pop it out
and get out from there.

906
01:02:00,852 --> 01:02:02,187
Yes, exactly!

907
01:02:04,691 --> 01:02:05,524
Okay.

908
01:02:07,276 --> 01:02:08,111
Help me up.

909
01:02:19,162 --> 01:02:19,997
Okay.

910
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:22,497
What?

911
01:02:22,499 --> 01:02:23,333
Go up there.

912
01:02:25,211 --> 01:02:27,877
There's not actually
an exit up there.

913
01:02:27,879 --> 01:02:30,214
Look, lure her up there

914
01:02:30,216 --> 01:02:32,260
and then meet me in
the kitchen, okay?

915
01:02:33,218 --> 01:02:34,386
Oh, so I'm bait, now?

916
01:02:36,472 --> 01:02:37,598
Trust me, okay?

917
01:02:39,892 --> 01:02:40,727
Yeah, but...

918
01:02:41,852 --> 01:02:42,685
K.K.

919
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,771
Fine, fine.

920
01:03:09,421 --> 01:03:10,671
It is June 17th.

921
01:03:10,673 --> 01:03:12,298
I'm here with Anna Winter

922
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:14,510
attempting to speak
to Sister Catherine.

923
01:03:23,269 --> 01:03:27,482
Sister Catherine, we surrender.

924
01:03:39,493 --> 01:03:43,914
Anna has agreed to stay so
as long as you spare my life.

925
01:03:44,915 --> 01:03:46,167
Isn't that right, Anna.

926
01:03:47,627 --> 01:03:48,461
Yeah.

927
01:04:28,251 --> 01:04:35,173
Kenneth, I know you're
in here, I heard you.

928
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:48,852
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

929
01:04:48,854 --> 01:04:50,270
Do your job!

930
01:04:50,272 --> 01:04:51,187
Nice to see you.

931
01:04:51,189 --> 01:04:53,607
You disobeyed me.

932
01:04:53,609 --> 01:04:54,610
Do your job!

933
01:04:56,069 --> 01:04:57,611
Keep your promise!

934
01:04:57,613 --> 01:04:58,448
I can't.

935
01:04:59,406 --> 01:05:00,325
Okay, okay.

936
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,015
Oh, thank God.

937
01:05:25,098 --> 01:05:27,225
Okay, okay follow me.

938
01:05:31,689 --> 01:05:32,899
Come on, K.K., let's go.

939
01:05:37,403 --> 01:05:38,279
I'm sorry, Anna.

940
01:05:39,488 --> 01:05:40,490
Don't be, come on.

941
01:05:43,825 --> 01:05:45,033
K.K., move!

942
01:05:49,749 --> 01:05:51,457
I don't really wanna
do this, I'm sorry,

943
01:05:51,459 --> 01:05:52,957
but I have no choice.

944
01:05:52,959 --> 01:05:56,294
No, no!

945
01:06:02,178 --> 01:06:04,180
Anna, I've been
dead for three years.

946
01:06:08,350 --> 01:06:10,060
She killed me in this house!

947
01:06:11,437 --> 01:06:13,604
And she won't let me leave
until I kill her replacement.

948
01:06:13,606 --> 01:06:17,109
K.K. don't do
this!

949
01:06:20,613 --> 01:06:22,115
I tried to save us both.

950
01:06:23,281 --> 01:06:25,281
If we got rid of
her, we'd be free.

951
01:06:25,283 --> 01:06:27,450
No, it's not too late, K.K.

952
01:06:27,452 --> 01:06:29,955
You can't beat her,
she's too powerful!

953
01:06:31,164 --> 01:06:34,625
I thought we could,
but I was wrong.

954
01:07:22,341 --> 01:07:23,175
Anna.

955
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:28,513
Anna!

956
01:07:34,144 --> 01:07:35,187
Why'd you do it?

957
01:07:38,524 --> 01:07:41,776
Like you, my life
was not worth living.

958
01:07:41,778 --> 01:07:44,986
Father Don said that
if I killed myself

959
01:07:44,988 --> 01:07:48,158
I would go to hell,
and I didn't care!

960
01:07:51,412 --> 01:07:53,995
And then I was blessed
with a chance to return

961
01:07:53,997 --> 01:07:57,042
to this land and
prove myself to God.

962
01:07:59,586 --> 01:08:02,879
I wanna give you the
same opportunity.

963
01:08:02,881 --> 01:08:07,258
In the name of the Father, and
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

964
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:12,224
In the name of the Father, and
the Son, and the Holy Ghost!

965
01:08:40,837 --> 01:08:42,254
No, no, no, no.

966
01:08:54,891 --> 01:08:56,058
Anna?

967
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:57,059
Mike?

968
01:08:57,061 --> 01:08:58,393
Anna?

969
01:08:58,395 --> 01:08:59,228
Mike?

970
01:08:59,230 --> 01:09:00,228
I'm here.

971
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:01,064
Where?

972
01:09:02,316 --> 01:09:03,234
Mike, Mike.

973
01:09:36,642 --> 01:09:37,474
Oh my God, Anna!

974
01:09:38,311 --> 01:09:39,518
Sorry, sorry!

975
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,187
Oh, should have read
the room, sorry, sorry.

976
01:09:41,189 --> 01:09:42,020
It's me.
K.K.

977
01:09:42,022 --> 01:09:44,105
It's K.K., yeah.

978
01:09:44,107 --> 01:09:45,691
Yeah.

979
01:09:45,693 --> 01:09:47,986
Hey, I saw some spooky shit too.

980
01:09:49,655 --> 01:09:51,531
I guess I'm kinda
spooky as well.

981
01:09:52,699 --> 01:09:54,742
Hey, but you know
what that means?

982
01:09:54,744 --> 01:09:56,663
That means we're losing
our physical form.

983
01:09:58,288 --> 01:10:00,372
Okay?

984
01:10:00,374 --> 01:10:03,209
Hey, hey, hey, you wanna
know how to beat her?

985
01:10:03,211 --> 01:10:04,044
Yeah.

986
01:10:08,341 --> 01:10:09,842
I'm sorry, Anna.

987
01:10:16,223 --> 01:10:17,976
Stay with me, Anna.

988
01:10:20,395 --> 01:10:24,854
Stay with me and your demons
will no longer hurt you.

989
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,359
Stay, Anna.

990
01:10:42,917 --> 01:10:44,502
Stay with me, Anna.

991
01:10:45,628 --> 01:10:46,754
Don't do this.

992
01:10:49,548 --> 01:10:51,381
Don't leave me, Anna.

993
01:11:01,601 --> 01:11:02,436
God!

994
01:11:41,642 --> 01:11:42,476
God!

995
01:11:54,614 --> 01:11:56,616
Mike, Mike, no, Mike, no!

996
01:12:05,624 --> 01:12:06,792
Oh shit!

997
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:18,137
Mike, Mike!

998
01:12:20,347 --> 01:12:21,805
Mike!

999
01:12:21,807 --> 01:12:22,641
Shit!

1000
01:12:24,476 --> 01:12:25,310
Anna?

1001
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:30,274
Anna?

1002
01:12:32,318 --> 01:12:33,149
Anna?

1003
01:12:36,489 --> 01:12:37,323
Anna?

1004
01:12:39,950 --> 01:12:42,785
Hi, who are you?

1005
01:12:42,787 --> 01:12:45,496
I'm Kenneth, a
friend of Donna's.

1006
01:12:45,498 --> 01:12:47,497
I'm looking for my
wife, Anna Winter.

1007
01:12:47,499 --> 01:12:49,332
I was supposed to
meet her two hours ago

1008
01:12:49,334 --> 01:12:50,835
and I haven't seen her.

1009
01:12:50,837 --> 01:12:52,252
Well if you wanna,
you know, come inside,

1010
01:12:52,254 --> 01:12:54,505
we can call her or look
for her or something.

1011
01:12:54,507 --> 01:12:55,341
Yeah, yeah.

1012
01:12:57,885 --> 01:13:00,094
Mike, don't go in there!

1013
01:13:00,096 --> 01:13:00,930
Mike!

1014
01:13:04,182 --> 01:13:05,017
Mike!

1015
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,768
Get away.

1016
01:13:08,770 --> 01:13:09,771
Please don't move.

1017
01:13:10,897 --> 01:13:11,732
Mike.

1018
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:15,360
Get away from there.

1019
01:13:16,445 --> 01:13:17,652
Tell her to come here.

1020
01:13:17,654 --> 01:13:19,529
No, I'll die for her.

1021
01:13:19,531 --> 01:13:22,241
Dude, please, just please?

1022
01:13:22,243 --> 01:13:23,867
Mike, don't go in there.

1023
01:13:23,869 --> 01:13:25,329
Anna, get back in the truck!

1024
01:13:27,205 --> 01:13:28,621
What?

1025
01:13:28,623 --> 01:13:31,584
Get back in the truck, now!

1026
01:13:36,423 --> 01:13:37,257
Mike!

1027
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:39,593
Anna!

1028
01:13:41,971 --> 01:13:44,095
It's him or it's you!

1029
01:13:44,097 --> 01:13:45,389
Go Anna!

1030
01:13:45,391 --> 01:13:46,223
Take me instead!

1031
01:13:46,225 --> 01:13:47,058
What, no, no!

1032
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:48,477
Trust me, Mike!

1033
01:14:46,703 --> 01:14:47,620
No, Anna!

1034
01:14:54,627 --> 01:14:55,626
Wait.

1035
01:14:55,628 --> 01:14:56,794
Anna, no.

1036
01:14:56,796 --> 01:14:57,797
It's okay.

1037
01:15:04,095 --> 01:15:06,219
I'm sorry, Anna.

1038
01:15:06,221 --> 01:15:08,723
What's gonna
happen to you, K.K.?

1039
01:15:08,725 --> 01:15:10,599
Heaven, hopefully.

1040
01:15:10,601 --> 01:15:12,520
I mean, if I didn't
screw up too much.

1041
01:15:14,021 --> 01:15:15,645
What about Catherine?

1042
01:15:15,647 --> 01:15:17,982
Well, I mean, she
kinda like burst

1043
01:15:17,984 --> 01:15:20,986
into flames, so it
usually means hell.

1044
01:15:26,784 --> 01:15:27,702
Bye, K.K.

1045
01:15:28,828 --> 01:15:29,662
Bye.

1046
01:15:39,338 --> 01:15:42,340
Just hold on, just hold on.

1047
01:15:42,342 --> 01:15:44,008
One, two, three.

1048
01:15:46,178 --> 01:15:48,221
I'm gonna call 911, okay?

1049
01:15:54,227 --> 01:15:55,644
Mike.

1050
01:15:55,646 --> 01:15:57,479
It's gonna be okay.

1051
01:15:57,481 --> 01:15:59,024
It's gonna be okay.

1052
01:16:21,381 --> 01:16:22,214
What?

1053
01:16:23,216 --> 01:16:25,465
I'm so ready for dinner.

1054
01:16:25,467 --> 01:16:26,384
Look at you!

1055
01:16:26,386 --> 01:16:28,551
You're not all brains after all.

1056
01:16:28,553 --> 01:16:30,138
Yeah, I don't know about that.

1057
01:16:31,348 --> 01:16:32,889
Still wanna go out
for track next year?

1058
01:16:32,891 --> 01:16:34,810
Yeah, depending on
the coach, though.

1059
01:16:36,229 --> 01:16:38,562
Gosh, I still can't believe
they let you skip 5th grade.

1060
01:16:38,564 --> 01:16:40,732
I don't think I'm
ready for middle school.

1061
01:16:41,943 --> 01:16:43,943
No one is ready
for middle school.

1062
01:16:43,945 --> 01:16:44,904
That's the truth.

1063
01:16:47,699 --> 01:16:49,072
Ooh, pizza!

1064
01:16:49,074 --> 01:16:49,908
I'll get it.

1065
01:16:51,535 --> 01:16:53,245
All right,
so look at this cat.

1066
01:16:56,289 --> 01:16:57,417
Hey, 21.09.

1067
01:17:01,212 --> 01:17:02,044
There you go.

1068
01:17:02,046 --> 01:17:02,877
Thanks.

1069
01:17:02,879 --> 01:17:04,382
Have a good one.

1070
01:17:07,885 --> 01:17:08,720
Wait.

1071
01:17:12,222 --> 01:17:13,725
Never mind, my bad.

1072
01:18:01,897 --> 01:18:03,732
Oh my God, my floor!

1073
01:18:08,365 --> 01:18:13,365
