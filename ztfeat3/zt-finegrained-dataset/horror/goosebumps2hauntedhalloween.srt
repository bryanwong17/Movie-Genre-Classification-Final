00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,486
Fear.

3
00:01:38,488 --> 00:01:42,854
<i>Fear is something
that everyone experiences.</i>

4
00:01:42,856 --> 00:01:47,155
<i>Fear is a feeling
that we all know.</i>

5
00:01:47,157 --> 00:01:50,624
<i>For me, a fear
that shaped my life was...</i>

6
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:56,290
God, that sucks.

7
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,292
"Recount a time
when you faced a fear,

8
00:02:06,294 --> 00:02:07,893
challenge or failure.

9
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:10,796
How did it define you,
or how did you overcome it?"

10
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:27,964
Hello?

11
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:31,266
Hello?

12
00:02:42,535 --> 00:02:44,233
Tyler? What are you doing?

13
00:02:44,235 --> 00:02:46,333
Are you crazy?
My mom is gonna hear you.

14
00:02:46,335 --> 00:02:47,901
You see this mask?

15
00:02:47,903 --> 00:02:49,201
Got it on sale.

16
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:50,435
Very scary.

17
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,067
Sorry.
I was in the neighborhood.

18
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:54,769
- I texted you like 10 times.
- I told you my phone's off.

19
00:02:54,771 --> 00:02:57,302
If I miss this deadline,
I don't get into Columbia.

20
00:02:57,304 --> 00:02:59,637
You'll be here with me
the next four years.

21
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:03,704
Consider me your safety school.
Close by, good parties...

22
00:03:03,706 --> 00:03:07,404
Oh, really. Do you also offer
a creative-writing program?

23
00:03:07,406 --> 00:03:10,872
Oh, I'm super creative.
Look, I got you a care package.

24
00:03:10,874 --> 00:03:15,039
- Pringles. And a little bit of Red Bull.
- Heh.

25
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,909
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

26
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,476
You are so busted.

27
00:03:22,544 --> 00:03:24,675
- So, so busted.
- I've got it.

28
00:03:24,677 --> 00:03:26,742
Mom,
this is not what it looks like.

29
00:03:26,744 --> 00:03:29,609
No, I know what it is.
I heard the entire thing.

30
00:03:29,611 --> 00:03:31,543
Do people
not whisper anymore?

31
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,377
"Hey, I brought Pringles
and Red Bull."

32
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,077
"You better be quiet
'cause my mom will hear us."

33
00:03:38,313 --> 00:03:40,044
Tyler, go home.

34
00:03:40,046 --> 00:03:42,679
Okay.
Uh, just to clarify,

35
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:45,078
do you mean back out the window
or out the front?

36
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,547
Okay, I'll use the window.

37
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:48,413
Sorry, Sarah,
I'll see you tomorrow.

38
00:03:48,415 --> 00:03:50,148
Ooh! I'm good.

39
00:03:51,216 --> 00:03:53,514
Ah! Still good!

40
00:03:53,516 --> 00:03:55,849
- Go to bed.
- Mom, I can explain.

41
00:03:55,851 --> 00:03:58,215
We'll discuss this
in the morning.

42
00:03:58,217 --> 00:04:00,817
- Sam is gonna love this.
- You go to bed too.

43
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:02,650
- What'd I do?
- I don't need a wingman.

44
00:04:02,652 --> 00:04:05,216
- Okay. Going to bed.
- Hmph.

45
00:04:44,308 --> 00:04:45,742
Ow.

46
00:04:47,943 --> 00:04:49,907
You need to stop
electrocuting yourself

47
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:52,408
- and eat your breakfast.
- Mom, this is due tomorrow,

48
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,308
and it's worth 50 percent
of my grade.

49
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,942
How about you eat 50 percent
of your eggs?

50
00:04:58,578 --> 00:04:59,943
Sonny, seriously?

51
00:04:59,945 --> 00:05:01,843
Sorry. I'm getting close.

52
00:05:03,145 --> 00:05:05,477
Coming.

53
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:07,911
Coming!

54
00:05:07,913 --> 00:05:09,411
Morning, Ms. Quinn.

55
00:05:09,413 --> 00:05:11,244
- Good morning, Sam.
- How you doing?

56
00:05:11,246 --> 00:05:13,679
Kathy! Thank
you for taking Sam.

57
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:15,946
We'll be back in three days.
We owe you.

58
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,213
You definitely do.

59
00:05:19,248 --> 00:05:21,047
Sonny!
Grab your backpack.

60
00:05:21,049 --> 00:05:23,115
Sarah, let's go!
I've got an errand to run

61
00:05:23,117 --> 00:05:24,983
- on the way to school.
- Coming!

62
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,582
My condolences on your bust
last night.

63
00:05:28,584 --> 00:05:30,783
Good thing I'm here,
in case any other dudes

64
00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:32,416
try to climb
through your window.

65
00:05:32,418 --> 00:05:34,182
Sonny. I'm gonna kill you.

66
00:05:34,184 --> 00:05:36,817
Kill him in the car.
Okay? Go, go, go.

67
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:40,118
♪ Halloween with pumpkins
And mice ♪

68
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,451
♪ Halloween, it's so nice ♪

69
00:05:43,453 --> 00:05:44,952
♪ Halloween ♪

70
00:05:44,954 --> 00:05:47,719
- Faster, faster.
- ♪ With pumpkins and mice ♪

71
00:05:47,721 --> 00:05:51,587
Hey, Kathy.
Hey, kids. Heh, heh.

72
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:53,153
Mr. Chu.

73
00:05:53,155 --> 00:05:55,788
Wow, you practically got
a theme park here.

74
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,488
Check this out.

75
00:05:59,891 --> 00:06:02,689
Oh, my... Oh! Whoa!

76
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:06,189
It's like being in the movies!

77
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:08,923
I'm gonna have these puppies
up and running in no time.

78
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:10,424
You know, for the kids.

79
00:06:10,426 --> 00:06:13,591
- Ha-ha-ha. Okay.
- All right. Bye.

80
00:06:13,593 --> 00:06:15,492
He doesn't actually have kids,
does he?

81
00:06:15,494 --> 00:06:16,792
No, he does not.

82
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:19,292
Ooh!

83
00:06:21,228 --> 00:06:23,829
All right, everybody,
let's make this quick.

84
00:06:25,496 --> 00:06:28,294
You can each pick out a pumpkin
to carve if you want to,

85
00:06:28,296 --> 00:06:30,495
but meet me at
the register in five minutes,

86
00:06:30,497 --> 00:06:31,664
- all right?
- Okay.

87
00:06:32,497 --> 00:06:34,596
Alrighty.

88
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:36,262
Right here? Really?

89
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:40,799
Yes, here. Everywhere.
It's called marketing.

90
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:45,431
Anything you wanna
say to me?

91
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:49,332
Mom... Mom, I was
working all night. I swear.

92
00:06:49,334 --> 00:06:52,165
I swear,
Tyler just snuck over and...

93
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:54,233
I've just been so stuck
on this essay...

94
00:06:54,235 --> 00:06:56,733
You're a great writer.
You always have been.

95
00:06:56,735 --> 00:06:59,334
When you have to sum up
your whole life in one essay,

96
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,501
it all just sounds so...

97
00:07:01,503 --> 00:07:03,069
unimpressive.

98
00:07:03,071 --> 00:07:07,503
Honey. I think you're very
impressive and very capable.

99
00:07:07,505 --> 00:07:08,770
You do?

100
00:07:08,772 --> 00:07:10,103
Thank you.

101
00:07:10,105 --> 00:07:11,470
I do.

102
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,704
Which is why I need you
to watch Sonny and Sam

103
00:07:13,706 --> 00:07:15,470
this week
while I'm working doubles.

104
00:07:15,472 --> 00:07:17,838
Mom! No!
My essay is due Friday.

105
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,471
Sonny's bigger than me.
He doesn't need a babysitter.

106
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:24,939
Ha, ha. Have you seen what he
blows up when he's supervised?

107
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:27,607
Hon, I know you're focused
on getting out of here.

108
00:07:27,609 --> 00:07:29,640
But if I don't cover
these shifts at work,

109
00:07:29,642 --> 00:07:30,908
I could lose my job.

110
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,443
I need to know
I can count on you.

111
00:07:36,878 --> 00:07:39,842
Okay. Fine.

112
00:07:39,844 --> 00:07:42,309
- Really?
- Yes, really.

113
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:46,544
Well, you have earned yourself
some corn cushions, little lady.

114
00:07:46,546 --> 00:07:47,844
Really? Mom.

115
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,945
You're looking real nice today.

116
00:07:52,947 --> 00:07:56,846
Thank you. Heh, heh.
Blue is very in this year.

117
00:07:56,848 --> 00:07:59,914
- I see you got the memo.
- I guess we're in the know.

118
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,014
Okay. Hey, you know,
the adult diapers

119
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,915
are 2-for-1
if you wanna grab another.

120
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,815
- I just need one today.
- Okay. All right.

121
00:08:06,817 --> 00:08:09,150
I don't need them.
They're for the nursing home

122
00:08:09,152 --> 00:08:10,549
- where I work.
- Of course.

123
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:12,816
- I... I don't... Heh, heh.
- Hey, no judgment.

124
00:08:12,818 --> 00:08:15,483
- Um, okay. Heh, heh.
- I use a toilet. Heh, heh.

125
00:08:15,485 --> 00:08:19,651
All right. Well, hopefully,
I'll, uh, see you around soon.

126
00:08:19,653 --> 00:08:22,451
Yeah. Yeah.
Thanks for checking me out.

127
00:08:22,453 --> 00:08:24,952
Ringing up my purchases.
You know.

128
00:08:24,954 --> 00:08:26,585
Yes. Yeah. Well, both.

129
00:08:26,587 --> 00:08:29,186
- Yeah. Heh.
- I'll just get my diapers and go.

130
00:08:29,188 --> 00:08:30,453
Yeah.

131
00:08:30,455 --> 00:08:31,687
Happy Halloween!

132
00:08:37,656 --> 00:08:38,989
Yeah, I can help you.

133
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:40,288
Hey, wait up!

134
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:46,356
Oh, dude,
science fair sign-ups.

135
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:48,390
If I can just get
my Tesla Tower to work,

136
00:08:48,392 --> 00:08:49,824
easily win. It'd be so cool.

137
00:08:49,826 --> 00:08:51,691
What do you mean?
You're already cool.

138
00:08:51,693 --> 00:08:54,992
We are treasure hunters.
People respect us around here.

139
00:08:56,727 --> 00:08:58,659
- Ew.
- Hey, Junk Bros.

140
00:08:58,661 --> 00:09:01,693
Spit wads? What are you, 9?

141
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,360
What'd you say?

142
00:09:03,362 --> 00:09:05,493
Sam, what are you doing?

143
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:07,430
I got this.

144
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,029
You know,

145
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:17,097
we were gonna TP Principal
Harrison's house tomorrow night.

146
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:18,930
But now,
I think I'm just gonna spend

147
00:09:18,932 --> 00:09:20,931
the whole night
chasing you guys around.

148
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:23,864
Hey. Boys,
move it or you're tardy.

149
00:09:23,866 --> 00:09:25,464
Of course, Ms. Hoover.

150
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:28,099
I was just extolling
to my good friends Sam and Sonny

151
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,633
my deep love for homework
and all things learning.

152
00:09:30,635 --> 00:09:31,868
Get to class.

153
00:09:36,436 --> 00:09:37,669
Yeah.

154
00:09:38,602 --> 00:09:40,635
What a jerk.

155
00:09:40,637 --> 00:09:42,234
I'd like to check
this book out, please.

156
00:09:42,236 --> 00:09:44,035
And you are...?

157
00:09:44,037 --> 00:09:46,036
Tyler Mitchell.

158
00:09:46,038 --> 00:09:49,569
Okay, Tyler Mitchell.

159
00:09:49,571 --> 00:09:51,970
Oh. Yeah, you have four books

160
00:09:51,972 --> 00:09:54,403
you haven't returned
since sophomore year.

161
00:09:54,405 --> 00:09:56,371
And your account is frozen.

162
00:09:56,373 --> 00:09:57,638
Damn.

163
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,572
It's gonna cost 40 bucks
to unfreeze it.

164
00:09:59,574 --> 00:10:01,539
I just spent it
on tickets for us

165
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,572
to see DJ Bisky
at the Den tonight.

166
00:10:03,574 --> 00:10:05,873
You have to come.
You can't say no.

167
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,140
My way of saying sorry
for getting you busted.

168
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:10,374
I-I can't.
My mom is making me

169
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:13,141
watch my stupid brother
all week and his friend...

170
00:10:13,143 --> 00:10:15,775
Come on. Don't wait for college
to start having fun.

171
00:10:15,777 --> 00:10:17,176
Show starts at 8.

172
00:10:17,178 --> 00:10:20,276
Get your brother
a babysitter.

173
00:10:26,713 --> 00:10:29,880
Okay. Sam, what do you think?

174
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,046
Nice. Looks just like you.

175
00:10:36,715 --> 00:10:38,183
Hello.

176
00:10:39,882 --> 00:10:42,346
Yeah. Yeah, you're speaking
to a Junk Brother.

177
00:10:42,348 --> 00:10:45,214
Yes, ma'am. This afternoon?

178
00:10:45,216 --> 00:10:47,348
Let me check with my associate.

179
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,348
- Hang up on her.
- This is our opportunity.

180
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,415
- We're too busy. Stop it.
- We're doing this.

181
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:54,084
I have my Tesla Tower project,
I have algebra. No way.

182
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:56,084
- Fine, fine, fine! Whatever.
- Sam.

183
00:10:56,086 --> 00:10:57,686
All right. Fine.

184
00:10:59,087 --> 00:11:01,819
You are in luck.
Yeah, we can squeeze you in.

185
00:11:01,821 --> 00:11:04,852
24 Ashley Lane?

186
00:11:04,854 --> 00:11:06,419
No, no problem. No problem.

187
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:09,755
Yeah. Fear not, ma'am.
Junk is our middle name.

188
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:14,787
"Junk is our..."?
Do you even hear yourself?

189
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:18,555
Get your shoes on.
It's time to get rich!

190
00:11:18,557 --> 00:11:20,722
I already have my shoes on.

191
00:11:42,895 --> 00:11:46,095
I guess this is it.
24 Ashley Lane.

192
00:11:46,097 --> 00:11:48,594
Twenty-four is the number
of people murdered here.

193
00:11:48,596 --> 00:11:50,361
All right, Sonny.

194
00:11:50,363 --> 00:11:51,995
Let's do this.

195
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:06,134
Hey. I don't like the way
those things are looking at us.

196
00:12:09,168 --> 00:12:12,468
We're treasure hunters, Sonny,
remember. Come on.

197
00:12:32,572 --> 00:12:33,906
Hello?

198
00:12:43,842 --> 00:12:45,008
Some treasure.

199
00:12:46,942 --> 00:12:48,809
This place
is definitely haunted.

200
00:12:52,443 --> 00:12:55,675
Dude, there's more stuff
over here. Come on.

201
00:12:55,677 --> 00:12:58,609
This room's
even worse.

202
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,776
Come on, Sonny,
it's not that bad.

203
00:13:00,778 --> 00:13:02,912
There is nothing
to be afraid of.

204
00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:13,946
Who stuffs a cat?

205
00:13:13,948 --> 00:13:16,482
How much are they paying us
for this?

206
00:13:20,015 --> 00:13:22,081
Can't believe you said
we'd work for free.

207
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,748
Not for free.
The lady said

208
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,882
we could keep any junk
we don't throw away.

209
00:13:25,884 --> 00:13:28,015
Some of that stuff
can have monetary value.

210
00:13:28,017 --> 00:13:30,149
You know what else
has monetary value, Sam?

211
00:13:30,151 --> 00:13:32,685
- Actual money.
- Just start cleaning. Come on.

212
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:39,051
Found some more stuff
in the attic.

213
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:42,221
- Okay, what do we got?
- Maybe this is worth something.

214
00:13:45,888 --> 00:13:47,186
It's stuck.

215
00:14:01,457 --> 00:14:03,756
Dude, I think
we just found a treasure chest!

216
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:05,890
- Go get it.
- Jackpot!

217
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:08,623
This is amazing.
It's like a whole room in here.

218
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,893
I told you.
We come here, we find treasure.

219
00:14:13,392 --> 00:14:15,792
Help me with this.
I bet this thing

220
00:14:15,794 --> 00:14:18,126
is filled with gold
and diamonds and Bitcoins.

221
00:14:18,128 --> 00:14:20,526
Uh, you know Bitcoins
are cryptocurrency, right?

222
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:22,726
It's not real coins,
it's virtual coins.

223
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,594
It's really cool. It starts
with a process called mining...

224
00:14:25,596 --> 00:14:27,560
Stop being a nerd
for a second and help.

225
00:14:27,562 --> 00:14:29,595
- Yeah, sorry.
- Thank you. Here.

226
00:14:29,597 --> 00:14:33,198
All right. You ready?
Three, two, and...

227
00:14:36,765 --> 00:14:37,932
What?

228
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:43,865
It's locked.

229
00:14:43,867 --> 00:14:45,664
Who would lock a book?

230
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,367
Here's a key.

231
00:14:51,034 --> 00:14:53,067
Oh, man.

232
00:14:57,536 --> 00:14:59,567
Well, what's in it?

233
00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:01,637
Nothing.
It's just a beat-up old book.

234
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:05,071
Doesn't have a title page.

235
00:15:07,304 --> 00:15:09,703
- So much for treasure.
- Well, look.

236
00:15:09,705 --> 00:15:12,138
We still have all this stuff.
This is a good haul.

237
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,637
Just grab the book anyway.

238
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:15,804
- It's gotta be worth something.
- Yeah.

239
00:15:20,473 --> 00:15:23,075
Sam. Sam, turn around.

240
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,609
Where did that come from?

241
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:47,412
"My name is Slappy.
What's yours?"

242
00:15:50,714 --> 00:15:53,578
Wait, I think it says something
on the back.

243
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:58,281
<i>"Karru marri odonna
loma molonu karrano."</i>

244
00:16:01,816 --> 00:16:03,413
He's so creepy.

245
00:16:03,415 --> 00:16:05,715
It's kind of like he's alive.

246
00:16:05,717 --> 00:16:07,414
I don't think
anything's been alive

247
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:08,816
in this house
since that cat.

248
00:16:08,818 --> 00:16:10,949
I mean, look at this place.

249
00:16:10,951 --> 00:16:12,983
- But I'm alive now!
- Aah!

250
00:16:12,985 --> 00:16:15,383
Oh, Sonny, just give me a kiss.
Just one smooch.

251
00:16:15,385 --> 00:16:17,583
- That's not funny.
- Yes, it is. It's hilarious.

252
00:16:17,585 --> 00:16:19,651
It's a business.
We're running a business.

253
00:16:19,653 --> 00:16:20,985
Take this more seriously.

254
00:16:20,987 --> 00:16:22,718
It's too easy, Sonny.
Come on, man.

255
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,285
Hey, I'm taking him.

256
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:26,285
Don't know why
you took that thing.

257
00:16:26,287 --> 00:16:28,419
- What do you mean? He's awesome.
- Whatever.

258
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:32,087
Hey, it's the Junk Sisters!

259
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:33,788
Oh, great.

260
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,287
Well, at least we know
our marketing's working.

261
00:16:36,289 --> 00:16:39,089
No teacher around
to save you now.

262
00:16:39,091 --> 00:16:41,355
Hey, are you wearing
my old sweater

263
00:16:41,357 --> 00:16:42,589
from my grandma's yard sale?

264
00:16:43,858 --> 00:16:44,992
Leave us alone.

265
00:16:46,358 --> 00:16:47,757
Okay.

266
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,891
Give me back my sweater
and I'll let you go.

267
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:51,124
Really?

268
00:16:51,126 --> 00:16:52,727
Unless you want
your face punched.

269
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,628
Whatever.

270
00:17:00,162 --> 00:17:01,428
And your box.

271
00:17:04,996 --> 00:17:08,561
Fine. Just take it.

272
00:17:08,563 --> 00:17:09,895
Yo, what we got?

273
00:17:09,897 --> 00:17:12,096
- What's this?
- Let's see. Old radio.

274
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,462
- Is that a ruler?
- That's a dog toy.

275
00:17:14,464 --> 00:17:16,830
A stupid book.

276
00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:18,596
Wow.

277
00:17:18,598 --> 00:17:21,131
Great business
you guys are running.

278
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:23,064
Heh. Your turn.

279
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:25,598
No. No,
I'm not giving you my box.

280
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,732
Sam, just give it to him.
I like my face unpunched.

281
00:17:28,734 --> 00:17:30,802
No way.
We worked for this stuff.

282
00:17:31,868 --> 00:17:33,633
- Hey, Tommy!
- Oh!

283
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,367
- Look at that.
- Tommy, give him back!

284
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:37,867
Want your doll? You dress him up
when you get home?

285
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:39,701
Tommy, this isn't funny.

286
00:17:39,703 --> 00:17:40,837
Sam...

287
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,802
What the...?

288
00:17:50,806 --> 00:17:51,972
What is going on?

289
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:54,905
Tommy, pull up your pants!

290
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,371
They're stuck.

291
00:17:56,373 --> 00:17:58,604
Thank you very much.
Sonny, we need to go!

292
00:17:58,606 --> 00:18:02,405
Go! Go! Go! No, don't touch
my underwear! God! Stop!

293
00:18:02,407 --> 00:18:05,339
No! Go get them!
No! Go get them!

294
00:18:05,341 --> 00:18:07,807
- Go!
- Okay, okay, okay!

295
00:18:15,244 --> 00:18:16,975
Better pedal faster!

296
00:18:16,977 --> 00:18:18,277
Oh, no.

297
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:20,110
Come on,
don't make it easy for us!

298
00:18:20,112 --> 00:18:21,342
We need to go!

299
00:18:21,344 --> 00:18:23,111
We're gonna get you, man!

300
00:18:23,113 --> 00:18:24,512
They're gaining on us!

301
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:27,713
Faster!

302
00:18:39,415 --> 00:18:42,282
- What just happened?
- I have no idea.

303
00:18:42,284 --> 00:18:45,248
Get back here, you two!

304
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,116
Ah.
Why does this keep happening?

305
00:18:48,118 --> 00:18:50,615
Sarah!
You won't believe what happened.

306
00:18:50,617 --> 00:18:52,383
You are never
going to believe this.

307
00:18:52,385 --> 00:18:54,616
We were in this crazy,
abandoned, creepy house

308
00:18:54,618 --> 00:18:56,984
and found this fireplace,
which had a cat on it I twisted.

309
00:18:56,986 --> 00:18:59,251
It went to a secret
compartment that opened.

310
00:18:59,253 --> 00:19:00,918
Then there was a treasure chest.

311
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,085
Okay, but long story short,
we found...

312
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:05,787
this guy!

313
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,619
Th-this guy.

314
00:19:08,621 --> 00:19:10,921
This... guy.

315
00:19:10,923 --> 00:19:14,520
Wow. It's like you're actively
trying not to be cool.

316
00:19:14,522 --> 00:19:17,788
Here. Mom specifically said
you should fold the laundry.

317
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:21,292
I'll be in my room if you
need me, but do not need me.

318
00:19:25,826 --> 00:19:27,657
Hey, Sarah?

319
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:30,758
This specifically says you are
supposed to fold the laundry.

320
00:19:31,993 --> 00:19:33,258
Sarah.

321
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:45,494
<i>♪ I spend all the time
Waiting at night for you ♪</i>

322
00:19:45,496 --> 00:19:48,794
What am I doing?

323
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:51,428
We already banned jumping.

324
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:54,763
I banned sucking, yet here you are.
Now, come on.

325
00:19:54,765 --> 00:19:57,896
Hey! Yes!

326
00:19:57,898 --> 00:19:59,330
Yes!

327
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:00,797
It's 4 to 1.
Why are you celebrating?

328
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,931
Scoring is a reason
for celebration.

329
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:05,032
Bye, I'm leaving!

330
00:20:05,034 --> 00:20:07,631
- Where you going?
- Out. I'll be back by 10.

331
00:20:07,633 --> 00:20:09,632
If Mom calls,
tell her I'm in the shower.

332
00:20:09,634 --> 00:20:12,200
You were gonna help me
with my science presentation.

333
00:20:12,202 --> 00:20:13,466
There's two dummies
on the couch.

334
00:20:13,468 --> 00:20:14,700
Practice on one of them.

335
00:20:14,702 --> 00:20:16,466
Ouch.

336
00:20:49,243 --> 00:20:50,375
Tyler!

337
00:21:48,322 --> 00:21:50,655
All right, there we go.

338
00:21:53,856 --> 00:21:56,190
Okay. And...

339
00:21:58,356 --> 00:22:03,189
Sergeant, your orders
are to guard this porch.

340
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:05,389
It was more than
a hundred years ago

341
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:07,656
when Nikola Tesla
first lit up the sky

342
00:22:07,658 --> 00:22:09,291
over Wardenclyffe, New York.

343
00:22:09,293 --> 00:22:11,024
Tesla wanted to create a world

344
00:22:11,026 --> 00:22:12,858
where anything
could be transmitted

345
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,358
through giant electric towers:

346
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,559
Power, sound,
maybe even brain waves.

347
00:22:18,561 --> 00:22:21,526
It was like
the original Wi-Fi.

348
00:22:21,528 --> 00:22:25,861
But suddenly and mysteriously,
he shut down his lab in 1908.

349
00:22:25,863 --> 00:22:28,628
His tower
never lit up the sky again.

350
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,862
Until...

351
00:22:29,864 --> 00:22:31,128
today!

352
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,698
May I have a volunteer?

353
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:35,796
You, sir, in the gray suit.

354
00:22:35,798 --> 00:22:39,365
Hold this
and prepare to be amazed.

355
00:22:40,999 --> 00:22:42,497
I present to you all:

356
00:22:42,499 --> 00:22:43,666
Tesla!

357
00:22:54,535 --> 00:22:56,601
Don't give me that look.

358
00:22:56,603 --> 00:22:58,801
I'm trying
to bring back your tower.

359
00:23:00,136 --> 00:23:02,169
Bravo.

360
00:23:02,171 --> 00:23:05,970
I, for one, think it's
an electrifying presentation.

361
00:23:10,038 --> 00:23:13,106
Sam. I'm not
gonna fall for that again.

362
00:23:14,806 --> 00:23:17,038
Ha-ha-ha. Very funny.

363
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,705
It's like a microphone?

364
00:23:18,707 --> 00:23:21,405
You're talking through
your cell phone or something?

365
00:23:21,407 --> 00:23:24,173
Sam.
Sam, it's a stupid prank.

366
00:23:24,175 --> 00:23:26,709
You ever heard
of personal space? Mm!

367
00:23:37,044 --> 00:23:38,842
How are you talking
to me right now?

368
00:23:38,844 --> 00:23:43,043
You brought me to life.
Don't you remember, Sonny?

369
00:23:43,045 --> 00:23:44,811
- Sam?
- What?

370
00:23:44,813 --> 00:23:46,677
What's the problem?

371
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:48,377
Just come up here. Please.

372
00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:50,545
Dude, I told you,
I don't care about Tesla.

373
00:23:50,547 --> 00:23:52,678
- Right now, Sam.
- Fine!

374
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,013
I've always wanted a brother.

375
00:23:55,015 --> 00:23:57,379
Please don't try
to educate me on Tesla.

376
00:23:57,381 --> 00:24:02,482
Hello, Sam. Thank you for saving
me from that moron today.

377
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,282
Oh, he's battery-operated.

378
00:24:05,284 --> 00:24:07,481
No, no, no.
Sam, Sam, he's alive.

379
00:24:07,483 --> 00:24:09,549
Sorry for what
happened with Tommy.

380
00:24:09,551 --> 00:24:12,682
I guess you could say
he got hosed.

381
00:24:15,152 --> 00:24:16,917
- That was you?
- Yep.

382
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:21,517
And now that we're family,
we can be brothers!

383
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:23,854
I think I'd make
a great Junk Brother.

384
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,419
Right. Just a sec. Sidebar.

385
00:24:28,421 --> 00:24:29,720
Are we losing our minds?

386
00:24:29,722 --> 00:24:31,653
I don't think
we can at the same time.

387
00:24:31,655 --> 00:24:32,988
Okay, but just to clarify,

388
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,721
we're talking
to a puppet right now.

389
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,956
Yeah.

390
00:24:37,657 --> 00:24:39,258
Maybe he's alive.

391
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:45,223
Of course I'm alive!
Heh-heh-heh.

392
00:24:45,225 --> 00:24:49,057
And I can make
all your problems go away.

393
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:52,261
Didn't your sister tell you
to fold the laundry?

394
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:58,726
There. Now you have time
to do your homework.

395
00:24:58,728 --> 00:25:02,027
Oh, what's that? You don't want
to do your homework?

396
00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:04,528
That's okay.
I just did it for you.

397
00:25:11,664 --> 00:25:13,495
You know algebra?

398
00:25:13,497 --> 00:25:15,396
A squared
plus B squared equals

399
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:17,429
of course! Heh, heh.

400
00:25:17,431 --> 00:25:20,764
This is amazing.
It's all correct.

401
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:22,731
So you can change
all of our grades.

402
00:25:22,733 --> 00:25:26,199
I can only change
the things right in front of me.

403
00:25:26,201 --> 00:25:29,801
But whatever I see,
I can bring to life.

404
00:25:31,235 --> 00:25:34,233
<i>Karru marri odonna loma</i>

405
00:25:34,235 --> 00:25:38,101
<i>molonu karrano.</i>

406
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:40,534
<i>Round one. Fight!</i>

407
00:25:47,138 --> 00:25:48,802
That is awesome.

408
00:25:48,804 --> 00:25:52,637
I will never question
picking up junk again.

409
00:25:52,639 --> 00:25:54,804
Wait until Mom
and Sarah find out.

410
00:25:56,073 --> 00:25:57,871
Slow your roll there, kid.

411
00:25:57,873 --> 00:26:01,405
Let's just keep this
our little secret for now.

412
00:26:01,407 --> 00:26:05,506
Give me a chance
to win them over first.

413
00:26:09,743 --> 00:26:12,841
Ah, you're terrible at this.
Heh-heh-heh.

414
00:26:12,843 --> 00:26:14,875
I'm literally crushing you
right now.

415
00:26:14,877 --> 00:26:17,175
Can't believe you're losing
to a puppet.

416
00:26:17,177 --> 00:26:20,377
Right. And I'm not
even using my magical powers.

417
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:21,544
Heh. Hm?

418
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:28,444
Back so soon?

419
00:26:28,446 --> 00:26:30,279
- Don't ask.
- Are you okay?

420
00:26:30,281 --> 00:26:32,445
- What happened?
- What happened?

421
00:26:32,447 --> 00:26:35,545
Well, turns out the guy I liked
is a total scumbag.

422
00:26:35,547 --> 00:26:38,047
Mom expects me to run
this entire house by myself.

423
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:40,381
And if I don't figure out
this essay by Friday,

424
00:26:40,383 --> 00:26:43,883
I'm never getting out of this
town. So no, I'm not okay.

425
00:26:48,018 --> 00:26:49,951
Why are you guys
acting so weird?

426
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,217
- Us?
- Nothing.

427
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:53,650
No reason at all. Mm-hm.

428
00:26:53,652 --> 00:26:55,317
I'm working
on my science project.

429
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:57,484
- We're just playing video games.
- Just us two.

430
00:26:57,486 --> 00:26:59,817
- Nobody else.
- Mm-hm.

431
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:01,718
I'm going to bed.

432
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,054
Good night.

433
00:27:08,721 --> 00:27:10,188
Who just said that?

434
00:27:11,522 --> 00:27:12,987
- Me!
- Sam.

435
00:27:12,989 --> 00:27:14,388
Good night.

436
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,155
It's a new thing we're doing.

437
00:27:16,157 --> 00:27:18,155
Good night.
Good night.

438
00:27:18,157 --> 00:27:20,056
- Hit the hay.
- Good night, Sarah.

439
00:27:20,058 --> 00:27:22,290
Night-night.

440
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:24,522
That is not cool, Slappy.

441
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:37,105
What the hell?

442
00:28:37,107 --> 00:28:40,772
- Ugh. God, they are such tools.
- Boo!

443
00:28:43,574 --> 00:28:46,273
Missed you at the show
last night.

444
00:28:46,275 --> 00:28:49,107
Bet you did. You have fun?

445
00:28:49,109 --> 00:28:51,275
It was okay.
A bunch of us just hanging out.

446
00:28:51,277 --> 00:28:52,775
Totally casual.

447
00:28:52,777 --> 00:28:54,277
Right.

448
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:58,609
- What's with the dummy?
- Oh, him?

449
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,877
We were just hanging out.

450
00:29:00,879 --> 00:29:02,879
Totally casual.

451
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,417
Fly, little ghost.

452
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:31,649
Hey, whoever that is, can you
toss me up some more string?

453
00:29:31,651 --> 00:29:33,085
Sure.

454
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,785
Okay.

455
00:29:41,787 --> 00:29:44,585
That's hilarious.

456
00:29:44,587 --> 00:29:45,986
Sarah?

457
00:29:47,422 --> 00:29:50,486
Oh! Hey, hey, hey,
not funny, not funny.

458
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:52,486
Sarah, stop fooling around.

459
00:29:52,488 --> 00:29:56,157
I'd say you're the one
fooling around.

460
00:29:57,589 --> 00:29:59,022
How are you talking?

461
00:29:59,024 --> 00:30:02,056
I love the theater.

462
00:30:02,058 --> 00:30:05,390
I always bring down the house.

463
00:30:08,726 --> 00:30:11,191
Wait, no! What are you doing?
What are you doing?

464
00:30:11,193 --> 00:30:12,792
Tell me, Tyler.

465
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:15,593
What does it say
on that top step?

466
00:30:16,894 --> 00:30:19,726
Uh... It's not a step?

467
00:30:19,728 --> 00:30:21,559
Maybe you'll remember that

468
00:30:21,561 --> 00:30:25,829
the next time you
step out of line with my sister.

469
00:30:36,932 --> 00:30:39,297
It was a puppet, man.
It was a puppet.

470
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:41,297
It had these
supernatural powers.

471
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:43,332
He could move things
with his mind.

472
00:30:43,334 --> 00:30:44,798
I swear.

473
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,099
She knows! Ask her.
It was in her locker.

474
00:30:47,101 --> 00:30:50,066
Please tell him real quick.
Sarah, tell him!

475
00:30:50,068 --> 00:30:52,267
It's just the meds
kicking in, sir.

476
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:54,300
Last guy said he saw a dragon.

477
00:30:54,302 --> 00:30:56,301
It wasn't a dragon.
It was a puppet.

478
00:31:11,739 --> 00:31:14,537
Nikola Tesla
constructed this tower

479
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,705
right here in Wardenclyffe,
New York

480
00:31:16,707 --> 00:31:19,405
to beam bolts of electricity
across the world.

481
00:31:19,407 --> 00:31:20,939
And today...

482
00:31:20,941 --> 00:31:24,206
we are going
to beam bolts of electricity

483
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:26,140
across this classroom.

484
00:31:26,142 --> 00:31:29,107
Someone beam me
out of this classroom.

485
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,841
May I have a volunteer?

486
00:31:33,843 --> 00:31:36,242
You, ma'am,
in the pink sweater.

487
00:31:36,244 --> 00:31:39,476
Hold that and prepare
to be amazed.

488
00:31:39,478 --> 00:31:41,277
Behold:

489
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,712
The power of Tesla.

490
00:32:04,616 --> 00:32:07,117
Mr. Quinn, unplug that now!

491
00:32:21,486 --> 00:32:23,587
That was awesome!

492
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:30,087
And that was my presentation
on Nikola Tesla.

493
00:32:30,089 --> 00:32:32,889
Any...? Any questions?

494
00:32:34,622 --> 00:32:36,688
Today's picture day!

495
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:45,023
This is not good.
I'm so busted.

496
00:32:45,025 --> 00:32:46,991
Oh, great,
the fire department's here?

497
00:32:46,993 --> 00:32:49,492
They're definitely gonna
make you repeat a grade.

498
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,092
Please tell me you guys
had nothing to do with this.

499
00:32:54,094 --> 00:32:56,525
Sonny blew up the science wing.
It was so cool.

500
00:32:56,527 --> 00:32:58,525
It was an accident.

501
00:32:58,527 --> 00:33:00,126
What are you doing here?

502
00:33:00,128 --> 00:33:02,593
Tyler Mitchell just got loaded
into an ambulance.

503
00:33:02,595 --> 00:33:04,793
He said the dummy
you guys put in my backpack

504
00:33:04,795 --> 00:33:08,295
attacked him
with supernatural powers.

505
00:33:08,297 --> 00:33:10,762
We didn't put Slappy
in your backpack.

506
00:33:12,431 --> 00:33:13,797
Get in.

507
00:33:15,832 --> 00:33:17,330
<i>You're telling me</i>

508
00:33:17,332 --> 00:33:20,630
that you discovered
a walking, talking dummy

509
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:22,298
and you didn't tell me?

510
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,465
He seemed like a nice guy
at the start.

511
00:33:24,467 --> 00:33:28,132
- He had great manners.
- He told us to keep it a secret.

512
00:33:28,134 --> 00:33:30,233
A, I'm your sister.

513
00:33:30,235 --> 00:33:31,899
And B, as a general rule,

514
00:33:31,901 --> 00:33:34,468
when an animated doll
tells you to keep secrets,

515
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,700
that's a red flag.

516
00:33:35,702 --> 00:33:37,134
He's not just some doll.

517
00:33:37,136 --> 00:33:39,135
He's got powers.
He can move stuff with his mind.

518
00:33:39,137 --> 00:33:40,935
You guys, this is insane.

519
00:33:40,937 --> 00:33:43,836
I mean,
why would he go after Tyler?

520
00:33:43,838 --> 00:33:46,969
Maybe he heard you complaining
about him last night.

521
00:33:46,971 --> 00:33:48,839
Great.
What else did I complain about?

522
00:33:51,206 --> 00:33:52,471
Mom.

523
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:07,140
Hey, kids, you wanna see
the mummies come to life?

524
00:34:07,142 --> 00:34:09,341
- Sorry, Mr. Chu!
- Don't have time to talk now!

525
00:34:09,343 --> 00:34:11,174
Your loss!

526
00:34:12,944 --> 00:34:14,575
- Mom!
- Ms. Quinn!

527
00:34:17,144 --> 00:34:22,577
Hey. You didn't tell me you got
a ventriloquist dummy. How fun!

528
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:25,344
He was sitting at the table
like a little person.

529
00:34:25,346 --> 00:34:28,445
"Hi, kids. My name is Bobo.

530
00:34:28,447 --> 00:34:31,012
And I like listening to Mom."
Heh, heh.

531
00:34:31,014 --> 00:34:33,113
Mom, his name is Slappy,

532
00:34:33,115 --> 00:34:35,213
and I would not do that
if I were you.

533
00:34:35,215 --> 00:34:37,314
Slappy.
That's a ridiculous name.

534
00:34:37,316 --> 00:34:39,481
No, no. His name is Bobo.

535
00:34:39,483 --> 00:34:42,614
- Mom, you don't understand.
- Ms. Quinn, he's alive.

536
00:34:42,616 --> 00:34:44,714
I think these guys
are trying to play

537
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:46,882
some sort of
a Halloween prank on us,

538
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:48,882
but I'm not buying it.
Are you? No.

539
00:34:50,485 --> 00:34:53,683
Oh, let me get that.
But nice try. Very creative.

540
00:34:53,685 --> 00:34:56,686
Stay right there.
Don't go anywhere.

541
00:35:04,054 --> 00:35:07,487
Hi, kids. Good day at school?

542
00:35:07,489 --> 00:35:10,187
Oh, my God. He sounds
even creepier than he looks.

543
00:35:10,189 --> 00:35:13,321
Ha-ha-ha. We're gonna be
such a happy family.

544
00:35:13,323 --> 00:35:14,988
You're not our family.

545
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:17,489
Do it, Sonny. Turn him off.

546
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:21,123
Hearing you say that
makes me mad.

547
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:26,457
<i>"Karru marri odonna
loma molonu karrano."</i>

548
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:28,124
Don't do that.

549
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,758
Do it again.

550
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,791
<i>"Karru marri odonna
loma molonu karrano."</i>

551
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,397
It worked.

552
00:35:56,898 --> 00:35:58,297
And trust me.

553
00:35:58,299 --> 00:36:01,131
You don't want to find out
what happens...

554
00:36:01,133 --> 00:36:04,167
when I get mad.

555
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,065
- Okay.
- Hm?

556
00:36:07,067 --> 00:36:10,299
Well, that was
an interesting phone call.

557
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:11,932
Anything you wanna tell me?

558
00:36:11,934 --> 00:36:14,300
Yes, we've been trying to.
That dummy is evil.

559
00:36:14,302 --> 00:36:16,767
You blew up the science lab?

560
00:36:16,769 --> 00:36:18,534
Yeah, there was that too.

561
00:36:18,536 --> 00:36:20,934
Do you know
how much damage you've caused?

562
00:36:20,936 --> 00:36:22,202
It wasn't Sonny's fault.

563
00:36:22,204 --> 00:36:24,102
I'm sure it was an accident.

564
00:36:24,104 --> 00:36:27,203
- It wasn't an accident. The dummy did it.
- Yeah.

565
00:36:27,205 --> 00:36:29,936
Do I look like a dummy
to you?

566
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,536
We're telling
the truth!

567
00:36:31,538 --> 00:36:32,971
Here's some truth for you.

568
00:36:32,973 --> 00:36:35,038
Halloween is canceled
for the three of you.

569
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,671
- What?
- Canceled.

570
00:36:36,673 --> 00:36:39,005
- Come on.
- You know...

571
00:36:39,007 --> 00:36:42,806
I expect this kind of
craziness from the boys.

572
00:36:42,808 --> 00:36:44,706
But I felt like
you were gonna help me

573
00:36:44,708 --> 00:36:46,408
keep things under control,
Sarah.

574
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,840
Mom.

575
00:36:47,842 --> 00:36:49,673
I'm disappointed.

576
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:51,409
- Come on. Mom.
- Mom, please.

577
00:36:54,543 --> 00:36:57,278
Not as disappointed
as I am.

578
00:36:58,311 --> 00:37:00,578
My room.
Now.

579
00:37:05,347 --> 00:37:06,878
We've got a problem.

580
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,345
Yeah. I have never seen
your mom that mad.

581
00:37:09,347 --> 00:37:11,712
I'm talking about
the psycho dummy on our couch.

582
00:37:11,714 --> 00:37:15,447
Did somebody call
a family meeting without me?

583
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:17,646
No, no. Slappy,
why would you think that?

584
00:37:17,648 --> 00:37:21,214
We were just planning
a surprise party for you.

585
00:37:21,216 --> 00:37:24,648
Well, I've got a surprise
for the three of you.

586
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:27,049
This is my house now.

587
00:37:27,051 --> 00:37:29,049
And under my roof,

588
00:37:29,051 --> 00:37:30,849
I make the rules.

589
00:37:30,851 --> 00:37:33,950
Sorry, but you just got voted
out of this family.

590
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:36,053
- Huh? Aah!
- Oh!

591
00:37:41,154 --> 00:37:43,552
What do we do with him now?

592
00:37:43,554 --> 00:37:44,819
Fireplace.

593
00:37:44,821 --> 00:37:46,319
No. No way.

594
00:37:46,321 --> 00:37:48,487
I would have nightmares
the rest of my life.

595
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:51,720
No. I have a better idea.

596
00:37:53,723 --> 00:37:57,021
Ugh. We've
been walking forever.

597
00:37:57,023 --> 00:37:59,889
It's like this whole place
is made of poison ivy.

598
00:37:59,891 --> 00:38:01,855
Stop complaining.

599
00:38:01,857 --> 00:38:03,426
How much farther is it?

600
00:38:04,092 --> 00:38:05,357
Here.

601
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,893
This should work.

602
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,325
Am I the only one that feels
like we're committing a crime?

603
00:38:13,327 --> 00:38:16,693
It's a dummy. The only crime
we're committing is littering.

604
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,193
- Ready?
- Yeah, yeah.

605
00:38:20,195 --> 00:38:22,229
Okay, watch out.

606
00:38:34,465 --> 00:38:36,198
It's done.

607
00:38:37,865 --> 00:38:39,433
Let's get out of here.

608
00:38:44,233 --> 00:38:45,534
Sonny, come on.

609
00:38:58,702 --> 00:39:00,235
We just killed a puppet.

610
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:02,369
Trust me, we had to.

611
00:39:02,371 --> 00:39:04,436
And I say we just
forget it ever happened,

612
00:39:04,438 --> 00:39:06,270
because no one
will believe us anyway.

613
00:39:06,272 --> 00:39:07,537
It's over.

614
00:39:07,539 --> 00:39:09,203
He's locked in a suitcase.

615
00:39:09,205 --> 00:39:11,770
There's no way
that dummy's getting out.

616
00:39:16,007 --> 00:39:18,638
Who you calling "dummy,"
dummy?

617
00:39:23,475 --> 00:39:24,840
What do you want from us?

618
00:39:24,842 --> 00:39:27,640
I just want to be
part of the family.

619
00:39:27,642 --> 00:39:29,776
He's gonna break
through the windshield.

620
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:43,243
Is everyone okay?

621
00:39:43,245 --> 00:39:44,712
Yeah.
Think so.

622
00:39:46,346 --> 00:39:49,212
Where's Slappy?

623
00:39:49,214 --> 00:39:52,448
Guys, I think we just made
things a thousand times worse.

624

All right.
Here you go. Happy Halloween.

Hey, what's up, my witches?

636

- It's super important.

723

the lock on it.

Okay, okay.
What book?

725
00:46:37,232 --> 00:46:38,830
The one you stole
from us, Tommy.

726

Oh, yeah.
I've got it right here.

727
00:46:40,566 --> 00:46:42,498
- Oh, really?
- No, idiot.

728
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,832
Why would I be carrying a book
around with me on Halloween?

729
00:46:45,834 --> 00:46:48,399
Now, go back home
with your babysitter.

730
00:46:48,401 --> 00:46:49,832
I'll be there in a bit
to egg your house.

731
00:46:49,834 --> 00:46:51,267
Listen,
you little punk,

732
00:46:51,269 --> 00:46:53,400
I'm not the babysitter.
I'm Sonny's sister.

733
00:46:53,402 --> 00:46:54,733
You're gonna give us
that book back

734
00:46:54,735 --> 00:46:56,568
or I'll make your life
a living hell.

735
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:59,501
The only thing you'll use that
toilet paper for is to wipe...

736
00:46:59,503 --> 00:47:01,935
Okay. God, you don't have
to be so mean about it.

737
00:47:01,937 --> 00:47:03,835
Let's get
out of here.

738
00:47:03,837 --> 00:47:06,205
Book's at my house
in my room.

739
00:47:08,138 --> 00:47:12,471
But it's hidden, so good luck
finding it, losers. Heh, heh.

740
00:47:28,476 --> 00:47:30,974
Those are some
awesome costumes.

741
00:47:40,479 --> 00:47:41,711
Is this actually
happening?

742
00:47:45,913 --> 00:47:47,446
Guys, we gotta find
that book!

743

Evening, Mr. Tesla.

744
00:47:55,681 --> 00:47:59,780
You don't mind if we bring
your tower back to life, do you?

745
00:48:05,184 --> 00:48:06,981
What did he say?

746
00:48:06,983 --> 00:48:09,449
Shut up.

747
00:48:09,451 --> 00:48:12,617
Tesla used this tower
to project electricity,

748
00:48:12,619 --> 00:48:14,816
but I'm going
to use this tower

749
00:48:14,818 --> 00:48:19,018
to project my magic
in ways he never imagined.

750
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:23,319
It takes a genius
to know a genius.

751
00:48:25,221 --> 00:48:27,520
- Whoa.
- Heh-heh-heh.

752
00:48:27,522 --> 00:48:29,120
Come along,
Walter.

753
00:48:29,122 --> 00:48:30,520
We've got work
to do.

754
00:48:30,522 --> 00:48:31,989
Very well.
Let's go.

755
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:36,855
This is Tommy's house.

756
00:48:36,857 --> 00:48:39,890
Well, I guess
we just knock?

757
00:48:42,192 --> 00:48:44,323
Knock loud. He
lives with his grandma.

758
00:48:46,493 --> 00:48:48,124
Okay.

759
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,824
Wait! Guys,
there she is.

760
00:48:51,826 --> 00:48:53,192
She's asleep.

761
00:48:53,194 --> 00:48:55,126
I guess we'll just
have to wake her up.

762
00:48:55,128 --> 00:48:56,992
- Hello! Come on.
- Hello!

763
00:48:56,994 --> 00:48:59,359
- Hello!
- Tommy's grandma!

764
00:48:59,361 --> 00:49:01,693
Wow.

765
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:03,462
Guess she's a deep sleeper.

766
00:49:06,163 --> 00:49:07,662
It's locked.

767
00:49:07,664 --> 00:49:09,828
Find another way in
and go get that book.

768
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:10,997
What are you gonna do?

769
00:49:13,697 --> 00:49:16,297
I'm gonna make sure
nothing surprises us. Go!

770
00:49:31,801 --> 00:49:33,534
- Ow!
- Shh.

771
00:49:33,536 --> 00:49:36,467
What?

772
00:49:36,469 --> 00:49:40,137
I can't believe we're
breaking into someone's house right now.

773
00:49:48,272 --> 00:49:50,805
Shh.

774
00:49:53,507 --> 00:49:55,438
Hey, they got gummy bears.

775
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,240
Who cares?
Stop screwing around.

Whoa. Whoa.

781
00:50:20,378 --> 00:50:24,843
Why settle for
a small family, Walter,

782
00:50:24,845 --> 00:50:28,312
when we can project
my power everywhere

783
00:50:28,314 --> 00:50:31,513
and bring all of
Halloween to life?

784
00:50:31,515 --> 00:50:33,745
Yeah.

00:51:55,165 --> 00:51:57,129
- Oh.
- Ah!

797
00:51:59,666 --> 00:52:01,030
Sam!

798
00:52:01,032 --> 00:52:03,031
The hand
has my hand!

799
00:52:03,033 --> 00:52:05,031
Just rip it off!
Throw it!

800
00:52:10,468 --> 00:52:12,868
Sam. Turn around.

801
00:52:14,336 --> 00:52:15,469
They're moving.

802
00:52:16,903 --> 00:52:18,501
Sonny,
they're just gummy bears.

803
00:52:18,503 --> 00:52:20,602
They're so tiny and cute.
What can they do?

804
00:52:25,204 --> 00:52:26,537
Hey there, little guys.

805
00:52:26,539 --> 00:52:28,337
Sam, you just ate
half their family.

806
00:52:28,339 --> 00:52:29,972
I would not do that
if I were you.

807
00:52:43,108 --> 00:52:45,174
Why are they walking
towards us?

808
00:52:45,176 --> 00:52:47,840
Okay. All right.
Maybe

809
00:52:47,842 --> 00:52:51,242
they just want us
to stay and play.

810
00:53:03,579 --> 00:53:05,411
God, where is everyone?

811
00:53:05,413 --> 00:53:07,511
Oh, there's one
on my back, Sam!

812
00:53:07,513 --> 00:53:09,212
Okay, okay!

813
00:53:12,348 --> 00:53:15,213
- Pull harder!
- I'm trying!

814
00:53:15,215 --> 00:53:16,779
- Whoa.
- Ha-ha-ha!

815
00:53:16,781 --> 00:53:18,180
Go for the window, Sam!

816
00:53:18,182 --> 00:53:19,450
I'm coming!

817
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:22,416
Whoa!

818
00:53:38,621 --> 00:53:41,953
Just! Stop! Giggling!

819
00:53:50,822 --> 00:53:52,754
Sam! I need some help
over here...

820
00:53:52,756 --> 00:53:55,821
Sonny!

821
00:54:00,824 --> 00:54:02,156
Mom, we're under attack!

822
00:54:02,158 --> 00:54:03,923
Sonny, what are you
talking about?

823
00:54:03,925 --> 00:54:05,559
Where's Sarah?
Who's attacking you?

824
00:54:07,426 --> 00:54:09,057
Gummy bears.

825
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:11,024
<i>What? Honey, you're mumbling.</i>

826
00:54:11,026 --> 00:54:12,259
<i>Put Sarah on the phone.</i>

827
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,425
- <i>Sonny.</i>
- Whee!

828
00:54:17,395 --> 00:54:18,627
<i>What...?</i>

829
00:54:18,629 --> 00:54:20,293
Okay, that's it.

830
00:54:20,295 --> 00:54:22,960
Do not leave the house!
I'm coming home.

831
00:54:39,566 --> 00:54:41,565
Sonny, help!

832
00:54:41,567 --> 00:54:42,931
Sam, I'm coming!

833
00:54:42,933 --> 00:54:44,600
Hurry!

834
00:55:07,405 --> 00:55:12,037
No, no, no!
You'll never take me alive!

835
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:18,238
That is my new favorite book.

836
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,939
- You okay?
- I think.

837
00:55:20,941 --> 00:55:22,805
Let's get out of here.

838
00:55:24,209 --> 00:55:25,806
What are you guys
doing in there?

839
00:55:25,808 --> 00:55:28,073
Oh, no big deal, really.
Just being mauled

840
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:29,575
by my favorite
comfort food!

841
00:55:29,577 --> 00:55:31,074
Wait. Just stop.
Stop, stop!

842
00:55:31,076 --> 00:55:33,075
What are you guys
even talking about?

843
00:55:33,077 --> 00:55:35,109
Everything is alive, Sarah.
Even candy.

844
00:55:35,111 --> 00:55:37,442
Well, is that the book?
Let's read it.

845
00:55:37,444 --> 00:55:39,943
There's something you need
to know about this book.

846
00:55:39,945 --> 00:55:41,310
What?

847
00:55:42,912 --> 00:55:44,211
Look out!

848
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:50,080
Whoa!

849
00:56:05,717 --> 00:56:08,116
That's what.

850
00:56:08,118 --> 00:56:10,116
This is not
a normal book, Sarah.

851
00:56:18,587 --> 00:56:20,118
Who would write this?

852
00:56:37,923 --> 00:56:41,025
<i>♪ They did the monster mash ♪
♪ The monster mash ♪</i>

853
00:56:42,558 --> 00:56:44,358
Oh, what is this?

854
00:56:45,293 --> 00:56:46,923
Okay.

855
00:56:46,925 --> 00:56:48,092
- Huh?
- Oh!

856
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,759
- Hyah!
- Oh, you rehearsed that, did you?

857
00:56:52,761 --> 00:56:56,395
Best costume of the night, sir.

858
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,265
Go!

859
00:57:25,601 --> 00:57:27,432
Look out, look out! Ah!

860
00:57:30,068 --> 00:57:31,466
What's going on?

861
00:57:31,468 --> 00:57:34,202
There! Let's take
the alley. It's empty.

862
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:39,834
Wait, wait!

863
00:57:39,836 --> 00:57:42,468
We need to read the book
and see how we can end this.

864
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:45,136
Let me see.

865
00:57:45,138 --> 00:57:47,836
"It was nearly Halloween
in the town of Wardenclyffe..."

866
00:57:47,838 --> 00:57:50,003
Blah, blah, blah. Here!

867
00:57:50,005 --> 00:57:51,737
"His revenge
was to create a family

868
00:57:51,739 --> 00:57:54,438
by bringing Halloween to life,
but that wasn't enough."

869
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,405
That seems like
plenty of revenge to me.

870
00:57:56,407 --> 00:57:59,840
"Because he wanted more than
a family. He wanted a mother.

871
00:58:02,542 --> 00:58:04,642
His plan was to..."

872
00:58:05,875 --> 00:58:07,474
Was to what?
Keep reading.

873
00:58:07,476 --> 00:58:09,107
I-I-I can't.

874
00:58:09,109 --> 00:58:13,709
That was the last page.
It's an unfinished manuscript.

875
00:58:13,711 --> 00:58:15,477
What?

876
00:58:16,779 --> 00:58:18,178
Okay, great.
What do we do now?

877
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:21,277
Slappy's gonna go after Mom.

878
00:58:21,279 --> 00:58:24,544
That book is the only thing
we have to stop him.

879
00:58:24,546 --> 00:58:26,878
We have to go to
the nursing home and save her.

880
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,811
Mom's not at
the nursing home.

881
00:58:28,813 --> 00:58:30,912
Where is she?

882
00:58:30,914 --> 00:58:34,112
- On her way home to save us.
- What?

883
00:58:34,114 --> 00:58:36,514
She called while we were
attacked by gummy bears.

884
00:58:36,516 --> 00:58:38,280
Why answer
at a time like that?

885
00:58:38,282 --> 00:58:41,415
Maybe because unlike you, Sarah,
I pick up Mom's phone calls.

886
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:42,814
Really? Guilt trip much?

887
00:58:42,816 --> 00:58:44,982
We need to find your mom
before Slappy does.

888
00:58:44,984 --> 00:58:46,683
Now, come on,
let's go!

889
00:58:50,686 --> 00:58:53,784
Your woodworking skills
are impressive.

890
00:58:53,786 --> 00:58:55,017
Yes.

891
00:58:55,019 --> 00:58:57,184
This will do nicely.

892
00:58:57,186 --> 00:59:00,052
Oh, I used to manage
a hardware store.

893
00:59:00,054 --> 00:59:02,985
- Walter. Focus, please.
- Yes.

894
00:59:02,987 --> 00:59:08,286
Now tell my monsters to get me
Mama and get me that book.

895
00:59:08,288 --> 00:59:10,820
Yeah. Yes.

896
00:59:10,822 --> 00:59:12,756
Run!

897
00:59:16,057 --> 00:59:17,488
Duck!

898
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:18,924
Look out!

899
00:59:25,426 --> 00:59:26,592
What the...?

900
00:59:28,327 --> 00:59:29,627
That's Mr. Peters!

901
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,426
- Nice doggy.
- It's right behind you!

902
00:59:35,428 --> 00:59:37,192
Ah! Not on my leg!

903
00:59:37,194 --> 00:59:40,427
Help!

904
00:59:40,429 --> 00:59:43,328
That's Mom! That's Mom!
Come on!

905
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,161
You bunch of scallywags!

906
00:59:45,163 --> 00:59:46,827
Kids, watch out!

907
00:59:49,863 --> 00:59:51,030
Behind you!

908
00:59:59,433 --> 01:00:01,497
Okay, now's our chance.

909
01:00:01,499 --> 01:00:03,465
Give me the book.
I'm gonna protect Mom.

910
01:00:03,467 --> 01:00:05,765
You get the ladder
and meet me at that tree.

911
01:00:05,767 --> 01:00:07,635
- Wait till it's safe, then go.
- Okay.

912
01:00:20,603 --> 01:00:22,371
Okay, okay.

913
01:00:29,806 --> 01:00:33,937
Oh, my God! We're all gonna die!
Run for your life! Ah!

914
01:00:33,939 --> 01:00:35,871
Oh, my God.

915
01:00:35,873 --> 01:00:37,971
Oops. Not a monster.

916
01:00:37,973 --> 01:00:39,372
All right, let's go!

917
01:00:39,374 --> 01:00:40,872
Come on!

918
01:00:40,874 --> 01:00:42,373
Halt!

919
01:00:42,375 --> 01:00:45,107
My orders are
to guard this porch!

920
01:00:45,109 --> 01:00:46,341
No way.

921
01:00:46,343 --> 01:00:47,973
You like carving pumpkins,
huh?

922
01:00:47,975 --> 01:00:49,974
Look what you did
to poor Terry.

923
01:00:49,976 --> 01:00:52,141
Hiya! I'm round.

924
01:00:52,143 --> 01:00:54,310
Sergeant Squash,
open fire.

925
01:00:56,478 --> 01:00:58,176
Oh. Ow!

926
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:07,844
We need to find
another way in!

927
01:01:07,846 --> 01:01:09,813
No. This is my house.

928
01:01:09,815 --> 01:01:11,781
I'm hit! Medic!

929
01:01:13,081 --> 01:01:14,647
What are you doing?
Put me down!

930
01:01:14,649 --> 01:01:16,280
Hiya! Happy Easter.

931
01:01:16,282 --> 01:01:17,680
- No, no!
- Ugh!

932
01:01:17,682 --> 01:01:20,147
Yes! Let's go.

933
01:01:20,149 --> 01:01:23,114
Sarah, I was so worried.
Are you okay?

934
01:01:23,116 --> 01:01:24,482
I'm fine.
Just hang tight.

935
01:01:24,484 --> 01:01:26,449
I'm gonna get you down.
I promise.

936
01:01:26,451 --> 01:01:27,949
I just need you to trust me.

937
01:01:27,951 --> 01:01:30,116
Don't worry about me. Run. Hide!

938
01:01:30,118 --> 01:01:31,951
Ghost at 11 o'clock!

939
01:01:34,186 --> 01:01:37,186
No, no, no! Get back here!

940
01:01:43,321 --> 01:01:45,786
That's my book! Ah!

941
01:01:45,788 --> 01:01:47,189
We gotta go.

942
01:01:52,357 --> 01:01:55,288
Sarah!
Sarah, let go of that ghost!

943
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:57,823
Do not let go
of that ghost!

944
01:02:01,792 --> 01:02:04,290
- You okay?
- No, that ghost took the book.

945
01:02:07,793 --> 01:02:10,257
- Mom!
- Oh, kids. Help!

946
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:11,826
No, no, no!

947
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:13,925
- Sarah!
- Mom!

948
01:02:17,261 --> 01:02:19,626
It's heading for the Tesla lab.

949
01:02:19,628 --> 01:02:21,260
Slappy brought
the tower to life.

950
01:02:21,262 --> 01:02:22,661
That's why
this is happening.

951
01:02:22,663 --> 01:02:23,962
We have to stop him.

952
01:02:25,296 --> 01:02:27,829
Uh, guys?

953
01:02:30,598 --> 01:02:32,763
Sonny, what do we do?

954
01:02:32,765 --> 01:02:34,365
I don't know.
You're the older one.

955
01:02:38,965 --> 01:02:40,533
No, no, no.
It's me, Mr. Chu!

956
01:02:41,567 --> 01:02:43,064
Mr. Chu?

957
01:02:43,066 --> 01:02:46,898
Shh! Follow me!
To the basement now!

958
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,632
Don't ruin the Mylar.

959
01:02:48,634 --> 01:02:51,168
I'm saving it for next year.
Go, go, go.

960
01:02:58,470 --> 01:03:00,068
Let me get this straight.

961
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:03,569
We are living a <i>Goosebumps</i>
story right now?

962
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:05,236
Okay, clearly you're a fan.

963
01:03:05,238 --> 01:03:07,370
This is the greatest thing
I've ever heard!

964
01:03:07,372 --> 01:03:10,270
Hold on. Let me guess, let me
guess, let me guess. Um...

965
01:03:10,272 --> 01:03:11,804
<i>Monster Blood.</i>

966
01:03:11,806 --> 01:03:14,772
No, too on the nose.
Yeah, you're right. Um...

967
01:03:14,774 --> 01:03:17,672
<i>The Scarecrow Walks
at Midnight.</i>

968
01:03:17,674 --> 01:03:19,872
No. <i>Haunted Halloween.</i>

969
01:03:19,874 --> 01:03:23,107
I don't know that one.
How does it end?

970
01:03:23,109 --> 01:03:24,940
That's the problem.

971
01:03:24,942 --> 01:03:26,440
It doesn't.

972
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:36,843
Mm! Mm!

973
01:03:36,845 --> 01:03:38,443
Hello, Mama.

974
01:03:38,445 --> 01:03:40,210
Remember me?

975
01:03:40,212 --> 01:03:42,378
You put me on your lap.

976
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:44,745
Put those cute words
in my mouth.

977
01:03:44,747 --> 01:03:48,512
What was it you called me?
"Bobo"? Ha-ha-ha.

978
01:03:48,514 --> 01:03:50,545
Can't talk?

979
01:03:50,547 --> 01:03:52,480
Don't you worry.

980
01:03:52,482 --> 01:03:56,413
From now on, I'll do
the talking for both of us.

981
01:03:58,583 --> 01:04:01,883
I'm gonna make you
so proud, Mama.

982

It's working.

987
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:17,487
Yes.

988
01:04:24,054 --> 01:04:26,986
My mind is literally
blown right now.

989
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:30,187
I mean, we get to finish
our <i>Goosebumps</i> story!

990
01:04:30,189 --> 01:04:32,554
This isn't a creative-writing
exercise, Mr. Chu.

991
01:04:32,556 --> 01:04:34,354
Slappy has our mom!

992
01:04:34,356 --> 01:04:37,389
Yeah, and then you get to
save your mom. It's Chapter 22:

993
01:04:37,391 --> 01:04:40,456
"The kids save their mom
from the demonic dummy."

994
01:04:40,458 --> 01:04:42,757
Well, the only thing
I had to save my mom

995
01:04:42,759 --> 01:04:45,557
was that book,
and I lost it. So...

996
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:48,090
Sarah. This is not
your fault.

997
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:49,891
If anything, it's my fault.

998
01:04:49,893 --> 01:04:52,759
I'm the one who found the book
and brought Slappy to life.

999
01:04:52,761 --> 01:04:54,493
And I even told Slappy
about Tesla.

1000
01:04:54,495 --> 01:04:56,426
Mom trusted me to
take care of you guys,

1001
01:04:56,428 --> 01:04:58,393
and I told her
I would save her.

1002
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:00,195
I failed.

1003
01:05:01,729 --> 01:05:03,594
I know I always say that
I can't wait

1004
01:05:03,596 --> 01:05:06,395
to go to college
and get started on my real life,

1005
01:05:06,397 --> 01:05:08,698
but you guys are my life.

1006
01:05:10,897 --> 01:05:13,129
This is a classic
<i>Goosebumps</i> moment.

1007
01:05:13,131 --> 01:05:14,963
Do you remember
<i>Say Cheese and Die...?</i>

1008
01:05:14,965 --> 01:05:16,963
- This is real life, Chu!
- Okay.

1009
01:05:16,965 --> 01:05:20,664
Guys, Slappy is using the Tesla
Tower to power Halloween.

1010
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:22,331
If I can get in there,
maybe I can

1011
01:05:22,333 --> 01:05:23,965
shut it off,
and we can save Mom.

1012
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:25,632
But there's
monsters everywhere.

1013
01:05:25,634 --> 01:05:27,165
How are we gonna
get past them?

1014
01:05:27,167 --> 01:05:28,666
Easy.

1015
01:05:28,668 --> 01:05:30,133
Camouflage.

1016
01:05:33,035 --> 01:05:34,870

01:06:32,415 --> 01:06:34,214
It's actually working.

1036
01:06:35,682 --> 01:06:37,680
Come on. We gotta
get to that tower.

1037
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:45,249
I can't believe
we're really here.

1038
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:46,948
I can barely see
out of this thing.

1039
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:48,682
Is it cool?
Is it awesome?

1040
01:06:48,684 --> 01:06:51,183
Hey, fanboy. Let's focus.

1041
01:06:51,185 --> 01:06:52,485
Right. Sorry.

1042
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,486
Let's go.

1043
01:07:14,757 --> 01:07:17,390
Don't. Move.

1044
01:07:25,992 --> 01:07:27,693
Come on, let's go.
Come on!

1045
01:07:39,762 --> 01:07:41,193
Look at this place.

1046
01:07:41,195 --> 01:07:43,394
It's so creepy.

1047
01:07:43,396 --> 01:07:44,962
Stay close.

1048
01:07:52,198 --> 01:07:54,530
No wonder Tesla
abandoned this place.

1049
01:07:54,532 --> 01:08:01,198
Shh, shh, shh.
Do you hear that?

1050
01:08:10,635 --> 01:08:12,068
Come on.

1051
01:08:37,774 --> 01:08:39,071
Oh, no.

1052
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:42,840
Not <i>Haunted Halloween.</i>

1053
01:08:47,543 --> 01:08:50,510
Oh, my writing was
so cliché back then.

1054
01:08:54,445 --> 01:08:58,276
I knew it! I knew I came up
with that first.

1055
01:09:00,579 --> 01:09:04,077
That clever little dummy's
writing his own ending.

1056
01:09:04,079 --> 01:09:05,944
Not in my book,
he's not.

1057
01:09:08,213 --> 01:09:09,915
Oh, gnomes.

1058
01:09:11,414 --> 01:09:12,879
Don't you dare.

1059
01:09:12,881 --> 01:09:14,113
Stay.

1060
01:09:14,115 --> 01:09:16,615
Ow! Son of a... Ah!

1061
01:09:19,883 --> 01:09:22,147
Oh, witches!

1062
01:09:22,149 --> 01:09:24,549
Get away, witches!

1063
01:09:29,118 --> 01:09:32,285
- Guys, do you hear that?
- Shh!

1064
01:09:35,786 --> 01:09:37,050
Wow.

1065
01:09:37,052 --> 01:09:39,620
Whoa.

1066
01:09:43,188 --> 01:09:44,920
Welcome.

1067
01:09:44,922 --> 01:09:47,055
Slappy.

1068
01:09:52,089 --> 01:09:53,987
Walter?

1069
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:55,688
Where's my mother?

1070
01:09:55,690 --> 01:09:58,791
Don't you mean our mother?

1071
01:10:03,492 --> 01:10:06,424
There's my sweet little babies.

1072
01:10:06,426 --> 01:10:09,724
I just love a family reunion.

1073
01:10:09,726 --> 01:10:12,958
- Mom.
- What did you do?

1074
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:17,059
I had a papa once!

1075
01:10:17,061 --> 01:10:18,992
He let me down.

1076
01:10:18,994 --> 01:10:21,894
But a mother's love
is forever.

1077
01:10:21,896 --> 01:10:23,694
Turn her back now,
you psycho!

1078
01:10:23,696 --> 01:10:25,428
Oh, should I?

1079
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:30,029
Unfortunately,
I have other plans.

1080
01:10:30,031 --> 01:10:32,062
Walter!
The book, please.

1081
01:10:32,064 --> 01:10:33,231
Yes.

1082
01:10:35,232 --> 01:10:36,764
This book.

1083
01:10:36,766 --> 01:10:38,730
Go prepare the tower!

1084
01:10:40,767 --> 01:10:43,064
I'm going to do what
Stine couldn't:

1085
01:10:43,066 --> 01:10:46,365
Finish this book,
once and for all.

1086
01:10:52,068 --> 01:10:54,835
Spoiler alert:

1087
01:10:54,837 --> 01:10:57,601
The manuscript gets destroyed
in that tower,

1088
01:10:57,603 --> 01:11:01,101
and my Halloween family
lasts forever!

1089
01:11:01,103 --> 01:11:04,303
Mama,
babysit the children for me.

1090
01:11:04,305 --> 01:11:06,102
Yes, dear.

1091
01:11:06,104 --> 01:11:08,270
We can't let him
destroy that book.

1092
01:11:08,272 --> 01:11:12,039
Sonny, turn this thing off.
I'm going after Slappy.

1093
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,738
Just you and me now,
Slappy.

1094
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:21,773
Can't hear you. I'm too far
ahead of you. Hee-hee-hee!

1095
01:11:21,775 --> 01:11:24,640
This is amperage
and this is voltage?

1096
01:11:24,642 --> 01:11:26,474
None of these cables
make any sense.

1097
01:11:26,476 --> 01:11:28,374
What about here?
Start pulling levers.

1098
01:11:28,376 --> 01:11:30,741
- No, no, Sam, don't!
- Ah!

1099
01:11:30,743 --> 01:11:33,110
Slappy booby-trapped
all this stuff.

1100
01:11:44,146 --> 01:11:47,980
Careful, Sarah. It'd be a shame
to fall from that height.

1101
01:11:55,882 --> 01:11:57,980
Plenty more
where that came from.

1102
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,317
Come on, Sonny,
turn this thing off.

1103
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:06,649
Oh, no. Sonny hurry up.

1104
01:12:06,651 --> 01:12:08,382
Slappy's at the top.
Do something.

1105
01:12:08,384 --> 01:12:09,783
I can't do it, Sam.

1106
01:12:09,785 --> 01:12:12,283
Come on, Sonny.
You are the smartest kid I know.

1107
01:12:12,285 --> 01:12:14,817
Sam, I couldn't even do
my little science project.

1108
01:12:14,819 --> 01:12:16,084
Slappy did that.

1109
01:12:16,086 --> 01:12:17,520
And even that one shorted out.

1110
01:12:20,588 --> 01:12:22,985
Wait. That's it.

1111
01:12:22,987 --> 01:12:26,787
We turn it up. All the way up.
We blow the fuse.

1112
01:12:26,789 --> 01:12:28,553
- Yes!
- The fuse is over there.

1113
01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:39,055
And now to finish this story
and destroy the town.

1114
01:12:41,625 --> 01:12:42,792
No!

1115
01:12:44,626 --> 01:12:47,090
What do you think
you're doing?

1116
01:12:47,092 --> 01:12:48,757
Writing my own ending.

1117
01:12:48,759 --> 01:12:50,258
Spoiler alert:
I save the town

1118
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:51,827
and put you back
where you belong.

1119
01:12:56,428 --> 01:12:58,125
What's the matter?

1120
01:12:58,127 --> 01:13:00,260
Writer's block?

1121
01:13:00,262 --> 01:13:01,694
Again?

1122
01:13:01,696 --> 01:13:03,327
- Grab that lever. Yes.
- This one?

1123
01:13:03,329 --> 01:13:05,661
On my count,
we push up at the same time.

1124
01:13:05,663 --> 01:13:07,330
Ready? Go!

1125
01:13:18,833 --> 01:13:20,264
Give me the book.

1126
01:13:23,467 --> 01:13:25,765
You're not gonna
get this book, Slappy.

1127
01:13:25,767 --> 01:13:28,800
I have a friend
who might think otherwise.

1128
01:13:38,904 --> 01:13:41,437
Nowhere else to run, sis!

1129
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:49,203
Fine. You win, Slappy.

1130
01:13:49,205 --> 01:13:52,071
I'll give you the book,
but you gotta turn my mom back.

1131
01:13:52,073 --> 01:13:53,607
Deal.

1132
01:13:58,908 --> 01:14:02,206
It all ends
Slappily ever after.

1133
01:14:03,775 --> 01:14:06,474
You forgot one thing:

1134
01:14:06,476 --> 01:14:08,374
Never judge a book
by its cover.

1135
01:14:08,376 --> 01:14:10,176
What?

1136
01:14:11,477 --> 01:14:12,775
No!

1137
01:14:33,648 --> 01:14:35,847
Sonny, what's happening?

1138
01:14:35,849 --> 01:14:37,015
Mom.

1139
01:14:38,349 --> 01:14:40,283
We need to get out of here!

1140
01:15:38,962 --> 01:15:41,093
It's working!

1141
01:15:41,095 --> 01:15:42,296
Go, kids!

1142
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:25,038
Hello?

1143
01:16:26,338 --> 01:16:28,069
Someone called for me?

1144
01:16:28,071 --> 01:16:31,738
- Sarah? Oh! Oh...
- Mom!

1145
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:33,471
Hello?

1146
01:16:33,473 --> 01:16:35,805
I got your message.
I'm here.

1147
01:16:35,807 --> 01:16:38,006
Don't worry.
Everything's going to be okay.

1148
01:16:38,008 --> 01:16:40,339
I need typing paper,
a thesaurus,

1149
01:16:40,341 --> 01:16:42,439
Diet Coke,
and a quiet place to compose.

1150
01:16:42,441 --> 01:16:46,207
Preferably in a comfortable
chair with lumbar support.

1151
01:16:46,209 --> 01:16:49,009
Are you R.L. Stine?

1152
01:16:49,011 --> 01:16:51,942
Me? No, I'm Dr. Seuss.
R.L. Stine was unavailable.

1153
01:16:51,944 --> 01:16:53,377
Yes, of course,
I'm R.L. Stine!

1154
01:16:55,144 --> 01:16:58,012
Then I guess this
belongs to you.

1155
01:16:58,946 --> 01:17:00,644
Don't open it.

1156
01:17:02,646 --> 01:17:05,044
My first book.

1157
01:17:06,813 --> 01:17:10,479
You realize I wrote this
when I was around your age.

1158
01:17:10,481 --> 01:17:14,313
More of an amateur work, really,
but I am sure you'll all agree

1159
01:17:14,315 --> 01:17:17,515
it shows the undeniable promise
of a brilliant young writer.

1160
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:20,180
Why do you have
a typewriter?

1161
01:17:20,182 --> 01:17:22,549
I was going to
save you with it,

1162
01:17:22,551 --> 01:17:25,248
although it appears you found
a way to save yourselves.

1163
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:27,983
- A typewriter?
- It's been done before.

1164
01:17:27,985 --> 01:17:29,583
Once before.

1165
01:17:29,585 --> 01:17:31,516
Maybe twice.

1166
01:17:31,518 --> 01:17:33,250
Maybe more.

1167
01:17:33,252 --> 01:17:35,183
Kathy?

1168
01:17:35,185 --> 01:17:37,485
Walter, manager
at Fred's Pharmacy.

1169
01:17:37,487 --> 01:17:38,718
It's nice to see you.

1170
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,852
Hi. It's nice to
see you too.

1171
01:17:40,854 --> 01:17:42,419
What are you doing here?

1172
01:17:42,421 --> 01:17:43,853
I don't know.

1173
01:17:43,855 --> 01:17:46,219
Walter! Walter!
You got turned into a monster.

1174
01:17:46,221 --> 01:17:48,887
You were big, green, ugly.
You were Slappy's henchman!

1175
01:17:48,889 --> 01:17:51,254
Weather patterns.
Very strange weather patterns.

1176
01:17:51,256 --> 01:17:53,421
But I think everything's
back to normal now.

1177
01:17:53,423 --> 01:17:56,422
Fine. Okay, yeah,
the weather has been weird.

1178
01:17:56,424 --> 01:17:57,989
It's true. Okay, thanks.

1179
01:17:57,991 --> 01:17:59,822
What happened to your shirt?

1180
01:17:59,824 --> 01:18:01,356
I don't know.

1181
01:18:01,358 --> 01:18:03,323
<i>Ixnay</i> on the <i>onsters-may.</i>

1182
01:18:03,325 --> 01:18:05,323
- Go ahead, <i>ollow-fay.</i>
- What?

1183
01:18:05,325 --> 01:18:07,524
Means "follow." Pig Latin.

1184
01:18:07,526 --> 01:18:10,559
Oh, the youth today.

1185
01:18:10,561 --> 01:18:12,692
So funny running into you.

1186
01:18:12,694 --> 01:18:16,526
Right? I always hoped we'd run
into each other outside of work.

1187
01:18:16,528 --> 01:18:17,793
Yeah, me too.

1188
01:18:17,795 --> 01:18:20,327
Hey, if you're not
busy next week,

1189
01:18:20,329 --> 01:18:22,294
would you wanna
have some dinner?

1190
01:18:22,296 --> 01:18:24,962
- Yeah. Yeah, heh, heh.
- Yeah? That's awesome.

1191
01:18:24,964 --> 01:18:27,495
So they don't remember
what happened to them?

1192
01:18:27,497 --> 01:18:28,862
The transmutation process

1193
01:18:28,864 --> 01:18:30,863
seems to have wiped
their memories clean.

1194
01:18:30,865 --> 01:18:33,362
All those who were affected
won't remember a thing.

1195
01:18:40,667 --> 01:18:42,099
Tommy?

1196
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:46,832
- Are you okay?
- Oh, my God. Guys.

1197
01:18:46,834 --> 01:18:48,833
I had this crazy dream.

1198
01:18:48,835 --> 01:18:51,533
I'm so glad to see you.

1199
01:18:51,535 --> 01:18:54,001
You know, can't believe
I'm saying this,

1200
01:18:54,003 --> 01:18:56,067
but I'm glad
to see you too, Tommy.

1201
01:18:56,069 --> 01:18:58,569
Kids falling
from the sky.

1202
01:18:58,571 --> 01:19:00,837
My work here is done.

1203
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:05,570
I'm a writer too.

1204
01:19:05,572 --> 01:19:10,070
Well, an aspiring,
very stuck writer at the moment.

1205
01:19:10,072 --> 01:19:11,737
My condolences.

1206
01:19:11,739 --> 01:19:14,171
All the horrors
in the world can't compare

1207
01:19:14,173 --> 01:19:16,707
to the terrors
of the blank page.

1208
01:19:19,341 --> 01:19:22,707
Um, any advice
on college essays?

1209
01:19:22,709 --> 01:19:25,774
Well, first rule of writing:
write what you know.

1210
01:19:25,776 --> 01:19:27,508
Thirty years,
and I couldn't figure out

1211
01:19:27,510 --> 01:19:28,775
how this book should end.

1212
01:19:28,777 --> 01:19:30,174
And somehow you figured out

1213
01:19:30,176 --> 01:19:31,543
how to finish it
in one night.

1214
01:19:32,945 --> 01:19:34,742
I believe in you.

1215
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:44,413
Hm. "Write what you know."

1216
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:47,845
<i>Recount a time in your life</i>

1217
01:19:47,847 --> 01:19:50,779
<i>when you faced a fear,
challenge or failure.</i>

1218
01:19:50,781 --> 01:19:53,179
<i>I think most of us
are afraid</i>

1219
01:19:53,181 --> 01:19:55,379
<i>that we don't have
a story to tell.</i>

1220
01:19:55,381 --> 01:19:58,347
<i>That there's nothing
special about us.</i>

1221
01:19:58,349 --> 01:20:01,214
<i>And then a moment comes
when you least expect it</i>

1222
01:20:01,216 --> 01:20:03,015
<i>where you have to step up,</i>

1223
01:20:03,017 --> 01:20:05,181
<i>no matter
how terrified you are.</i>

1224
01:20:05,183 --> 01:20:06,583
<i>But what
I've learned is that</i>

1225
01:20:06,585 --> 01:20:08,215
<i>it's good to be scared
sometimes.</i>

1226
01:20:08,217 --> 01:20:10,584
<i>Scared of losing
the people we love.</i>

1227
01:20:10,586 --> 01:20:13,283
- Stop, stop!
- It's a ventriloquist dummy.

1228
01:20:13,285 --> 01:20:15,184
- Oh.
- Really?

1229
01:20:15,186 --> 01:20:16,751
- That's not funny, Mom.
- Too soon.

1230
01:20:16,753 --> 01:20:18,351
No, I like it.

1231
01:20:18,353 --> 01:20:20,352
Congratulations,
Sonny.

1232
01:20:20,354 --> 01:20:22,218
Thank you so much,
Principal Harrison.

1233
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:24,753
<i>Or scared of not
achieving our dreams.</i>

1234
01:20:24,755 --> 01:20:26,553
<i>Because those moments
remind us</i>

1235
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:28,820
<i>just how special
our stories really are.</i>

1236
01:20:28,822 --> 01:20:30,456
- Here's to us.
- Indeed.

1237
01:20:33,523 --> 01:20:36,522
- Hey, Sarah!
- Hi, Mr. Chu.

1238
01:20:36,524 --> 01:20:37,891
Watch this.

1239
01:20:40,692 --> 01:20:43,189
I like it.

1240
01:20:43,191 --> 01:20:45,524
Yeah, I just made it
life-size this year.

1241
01:20:45,526 --> 01:20:47,857
You know, just in case.

1242
01:20:47,859 --> 01:20:49,825
No, seriously, you know,
just in case.

1243
01:20:49,827 --> 01:20:52,825
Right. I'll see you later,
Mr. Chu.

1244
01:20:52,827 --> 01:20:54,326
Bye!

1245
01:20:56,194 --> 01:20:59,694
<i>And maybe when you
face enough of your fears</i>

1246
01:20:59,696 --> 01:21:02,627
<i>life stops being
so scary after all.</i>

1247
01:21:02,629 --> 01:21:06,861
<i>♪ Now's the day
To make our dreams alive ♪</i>

1248
01:21:06,863 --> 01:21:09,829
Hey, honey.

1249
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:11,631
What happened?

1250
01:21:13,198 --> 01:21:14,496
I got in.

1251
01:21:14,498 --> 01:21:16,730
I knew it.
I knew you could do it.

1252
01:21:16,732 --> 01:21:18,598
Oh, I'm so proud
of you!

1253
01:21:20,733 --> 01:21:22,732
I guess I'm proud.

1254
01:21:22,734 --> 01:21:26,599
- Thanks, Sonny.
- Come on, bring it in.

1255
01:21:26,601 --> 01:21:28,533
Congratulations.

1256
01:21:28,535 --> 01:21:31,033
Here, take off your jacket.

1257
01:21:31,035 --> 01:21:33,534
Guys, give her some
ornaments, please.

1258
01:21:33,536 --> 01:21:34,767
Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

1259
01:21:34,769 --> 01:21:37,069
- I'm so happy!
- Ha-ha-ha!

1260
01:21:37,071 --> 01:21:39,403
- Here, put that right there.
- Yeah, I like that one.

1261
01:21:46,706 --> 01:21:48,973
Finally, a new book.

1262
01:21:52,373 --> 01:21:53,974
Yes.

1263
01:22:03,875 --> 01:22:06,374
Hello, Papa.

1264
01:22:06,376 --> 01:22:08,975
Slappy! I thought
the book got you.

1265
01:22:08,977 --> 01:22:11,275
Maybe those others,
but not me.

1266
01:22:11,277 --> 01:22:13,076
Why is that?

1267
01:22:13,078 --> 01:22:15,142
You know
I always survive.

1268
01:22:15,144 --> 01:22:17,077
You wrote me that way.

1269
01:22:17,079 --> 01:22:21,711
In fact, I wrote my own story
while I was gone.

1270
01:22:21,713 --> 01:22:23,711
And guess what.

1271
01:22:23,713 --> 01:22:26,113
You're the main character.

1272
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:29,211
