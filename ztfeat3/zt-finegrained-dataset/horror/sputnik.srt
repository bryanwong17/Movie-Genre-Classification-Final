<i>Who's in love, who's...</i>

13
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,625
Won't you sing with me?

14
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,292
Or should I inform Mission Control

15
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:11,208
that the commander's psychological
condition has worsened?

16
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,208
-Go ahead.
-Alright.

17
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,875
Then let's sing something you like.

18
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:20,458
You know, I used to kind of like
that part about the roses...

19
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,375
You see.

20
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,333
...a couple months ago.

21
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,000
<i>What's happening, Cheget?</i>

22
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,208
Ready for undocking.

<i>Roger! Everything according to schedule!</i>

25
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,000
So here's my plan!

26
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:44,083
When we get out of recovery,
I'm going home.

27
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,875
To my elevator, then my apartment.
I'll take off my shoes

28
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,583
and go straight down the hallway
to the very end...

29
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,208
And turn on the hot water.

30
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,875
And then just a tiny bit of the cold.

31
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,625
-Alright!
-And climb into the bath.

32
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,167
And just let some jerk knock on the door!

33
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,875
Just let him knock!

34
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,458
What about you?

35
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,708
I'm going to Rostov.

36
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,458
-What do you have there?
-Business.

37
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,083
Some dame again?

38
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,083
I know you!
Mr. "Beloved by women and children".

39
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,458
You can't tell me?

40
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:36,083
Temperature 23 degrees.
Command issued to open the latch hooks.

41
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:38,458
<i>Copy, Cheget!</i>

42
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:42,875
Latch hooks open.

43
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,583
Controlling the departure
of the TC from its station.

44
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,750
Initiating full disengagement.

45
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,500
We’ve undocked successfully.
I'm watching the station.

46
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,083
<i>Copy!</i>

47
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,833
Well, it'll be like this...
I'll lay there in the bath. I'll get out,

48
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,083
dry off with a towel.

49
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,583
I'll put on cologne, of course.

50
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,750
We'll dress up nice, wife on my arm,

51
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:25,083
and on the 14th we'll head to a concert

52
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,583
at the Zheleznodorozhnik theater.

53
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:27,875
There, just for me,

54
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,417
she'll sing:

55
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:34,958
<i>"A million, million, million scarlet..."</i>

56
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,333
What was that?

57
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,458
I don't know. Maybe the utility module?

58
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,333
I don't see anything.

59
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,958
-We're looking out the windows!
-Yes sir.

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,208
Oh you stinker!

61
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,833
Come on, come on, come on!

62
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,375
Come on, my dear.

63
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,208
Just a little more.

64
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,208
Well, you don't say!

65
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,333
Kostya!

68
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,125
How much longer?

69
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,750
-Hello!
-Hello!

70
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,750
OK, colleagues. We may begin.

71
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,292
This is a straightforward matter...

72
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,042
I propose we skip the introductions

73
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,583
-and move directly to the interview.
-OK.

74
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:04,958
I hope you don't mind.

75
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,208
The sooner we finish this
unpleasant business the better, right?

76
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,333
I'm not in a hurry.

77
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,000
What's that supposed to mean?

78
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,708
Tatiana Yurievna, we are not your enemies.

79
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,083
We know your methods.

80
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:24,333
No one will accuse you of willfully
inflicting injury on a patient.

81
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,792
But you will have to acknowledge
some degree of negligence.

82
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:34,083
Negligence is failure
to fulfill one's duties.

83
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,917
-I did what was necessary.
-You nearly drowned your patient.

84
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,000
I temporarily cut the oxygen supply
to his lungs.

85
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,958
He was improperly diagnosed.

86
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,833
The standard therapy would not
have succeeded.

87
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,208
You held him underwater
for nearly a minute.

88
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,208
The boy is seventeen.

89
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,667
The last two weeks his mother has visited
every office in the Health Ministry.

90
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,333
Then deal with his mother.

91
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,875
His psychogenic seizures are rooted
in her overprotection.

92
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,667
For now I blocked them.

93
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,958
They will return
if you can't keep her under control.

94
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,292
Tatiana Yurievna,
let me explain the situation to you

95
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,125
so you will have no illusions.

96
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,250
Now you only have two options.

97
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:13,583
Either acknowledge your guilt
and accept dismissal

98
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:17,167
or we will be forced to send your file
to the public prosecutor's office.

99
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,000
The conversation will be
very different there.

100
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,583
I did the right thing.

101
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,125
Tatiana Yurievna!
Can I have a word with you?

102
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,083
I answered all your questions
at the inquiry.

103
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,333
I am not from the Health Ministry.
To the contrary.

104
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,250
My name is Semiradov.
I would like your expert opinion.

105
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,125
You personally?
Or your entire task force?

106
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,958
It's about a patient.

107
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,458
I must ask you to come with me.

108
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,958
Bring him here
and I'll give you my opinion.

109
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,833
If you can do so within two weeks,
before I am dismissed.

110
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,083
I would be glad to, but it's impossible.

111
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:17,250
I came to ask the mountain
to go to Mohammed.

112
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,208
Are you asking me? Or is that an order?

113
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:21,958
I don't believe in orders.

114
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:23,917
It's in the human nature.

115
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:28,208
Orders are not effective
for highly intelligent people.

116
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,958
Interesting. Isn't that anti-Soviet?

117
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,208
Possibly. I'm not a politician.
You could say we are colleagues.

118
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,083
I run something like a research institute.

119
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,500
I'm also interested in neuropsychiatry.

120
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,458
I think you will find this case
very interesting.

121
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,333
Otherwise, I will bring you back.

122
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,708
Oh, and I will take care
of the review board.

123
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:54,833
You have my word as an officer.

124
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,667
<i>How's the weather?
Any crosswind expected?</i>

125
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,333
<i>-Nothing serious.
- I know.</i>

126
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,208
Help yourself!

127
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,333
There'll be no fancy cafeteria
once we land.

128
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:22,458
That's the one thing even I can't change.

129
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,375
I would like to see his medical history,
if it is not classified.

130
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,208
I'm sorry, but we haven't prepared one.

131
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,958
Would an oral report suffice?

132
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,125
Surely you have heard about
the recent Orbit-4 landing?

133
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,750
I read about it.

134
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,958
We had to sanitize the media report.

135
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,958
We lost radio contact with the crew
a day before they landed.

136
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,583
It appears there was an incident in space.

137
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,792
Our patient is the commanding officer,

138
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,458
Konstantin Veshnyakov.

139
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,833
He is suffering from episodic amnesia.

140
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:13,250
Do you want me to sign the nondisclosure
agreement now or when we arrive?

141
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,625
Nondisclosure agreement?

142
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,750
Apart from the amnesia

143
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:23,583
and physiological symptoms, suppose
the cosmonaut simply lost his mind.

144
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,167
The Soviet people probably
don't need to know

145
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,458
that their national hero
has lost his mind.

146
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,583
So where is the paper I should sign?

147

with each beat of the metronome

154
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,542
<i>you will experience a pleasant drowsiness.</i>

<i>You feel a pleasant warmth

158
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,417
Can they see us?

159
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:15,292

00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,708
-Tea, thank you!
<i>-Five...</i>

163
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,250
<i>Everything has become hazy.</i>

164
00:16:34,792 --> 00:16:36,417
<i>You are on the spaceship.</i>

165
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,042
I’m on the spaceship.

166
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,750
What do you see?

167
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,500
Something...

168
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,208
Something huge,

169
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,750
dark blue...

170
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,792
-A whale...
-No.

171
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,291
No, once more.

172
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,666
Tell me your name and rank.

173
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:13,375
Robert.

174
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,500
Duvall... D...

175
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,041
Field marshal Robert D Duvall.

176
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,750
Is that a joke?

177
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,500
Doctor, did I doze off?

178
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:35,083
Konstantin Sergeyevich...

179
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:40,458
We can’t make progress
if you won’t help me.

180
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:52,167
You see, Yan Leonidovich,
only the mentally strong

181
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,792
are sent into space.

182
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,625
Unfortunately, I cannot be hypnotized.

183
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,292
This is sabotage.

184
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,125
I will report you.

185
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:14,125
Yan Leonidovich Rigel.
Research Director of our institute.

186
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:15,125
Pleased to meet you.

187
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,000
There’s nothing to be pleased about!

188
00:18:19,292 --> 00:18:20,208
The situation is despicable.

189
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:23,875
<i>Comrade Colonel!</i>

190
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:27,292
<i>What happened to Averchenko? Is he alive?</i>

191
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,083
<i>If I’m guilty, give me a trial.
Otherwise, let me go.</i>

192
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,000
Do you hear me?

193
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,125
<i>I’m going on a hunger strike! Understand?</i>

194
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,250
What do you need from me?

195
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:49,583
To begin with,

196
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:54,083
I would like to know your opinion
of his condition.

197
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:12,583
Look at this!

198
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:16,250
Well, isn’t this something new!
Did Semiradov bring in reinforcements?

199
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,917
I’m Tatiana Yurievna. Good evening!

200
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,208
The evening certainly is good!

201
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,083
Comrade Colonel!

202
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,250
Finally!

203
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,458
Your Rigel makes me almost want
to kill myself.

204
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:36,833
Would you like tea?

205
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,042
Thank you!

206
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,792
I haven’t seen you before.

207
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,750
I just arrived.
I was asked to assess your condition.

208
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:11,792
Is that your toy?

209
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:20,792
Yes. Mine.
I play with it from time to time.

210
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,083
Even in prison
I observe cosmonaut traditions.

211
00:20:24,417 --> 00:20:26,292
You take personal possessions with you.

212
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:27,750
Can you tell me what happened?

213
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:28,917
Again?

214
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:34,333
First I prepared for spaceflight,
and then we launched.

215
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,625
I completed my assignment,

216
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,000
and initiated the landing procedure.

217
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,417
After that, I can’t remember anything.
I ended up here.

218
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:45,125
You can find the details in my testimony
and MCC files. Have you read them?

219
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,458
Not yet, but I certainly will.

220
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,417
Tatiana Yurievna.

221
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,375
Forgive me if I’m wrong.

222
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,083
You don’t make the decisions here.

223
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:00,917
No, I don’t.

224
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,250
And you can’t discharge me.

225
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:07,917
No. But possibly I can help you.

226
00:21:11,042 --> 00:21:13,875
That’s right. I’ll even tell you how.

227
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:17,958
Call my mother in Moscow
when you finish here.

228
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:23,083
360-73-44. Lidia Sergeyevna.

229
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:27,208
When you call,
tell her you’ve seen me and I’m fine.

230
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:29,250
She’ll be worried.

231
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:37,667
Okay, then.

232
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:40,625
You should just go home.

233
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,500
I feel fine.

234
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,458
A cosmonaut’s health is always good.

235
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:49,000
Don’t worry about me. I managed fine
in space and I’ll manage here too.

236
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:00,667
May I?

237
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,250
It was nice meeting you.

238
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:18,542
Are you going to examine him or not?

239
00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:20,083
I already did.

240
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,375
He has PTSD.

241
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:26,000
The tactile sensitivity
in his hands is diminished.

242
00:22:26,042 --> 00:22:29,125
His sensory receptors or peripheral
nervous system may be damaged.

243
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:34,000
But considering you have kept him
prisoner here,

244
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:36,167
it’s to be expected.

245
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,625
If it were to be expected,
we wouldn’t have put him in isolation.

246
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,125
Well, everyone plays their own games.
Is that all?

247
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:44,250
You promised that I could leave.

248
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,875
Cosmonauts are not the only ones
who need my help.

249
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:48,708
Of course.

250
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,542
A helicopter leaves in the morning.

251
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:52,417
Show Tatiana Yurievna to her room.

252
00:23:04,292 --> 00:23:06,625
The institute cafeteria offers
three meals a day.

253
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:09,833
Good to know. But unnecessary.
I’m here for one night only.

254
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:12,708
Comrade Semiradov must
authorize your departure.

255
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,542
-You don’t have an exit pass yet.
-There will be one tomorrow.

256
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:20,583
Who are they?

257
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:23,250
They are inmates.

258
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,583
Brought in to do hard labor.

259
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:31,375
Room 108. At the end of the hall.

260
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:33,917
Do you have a room closer to the stairs?
I get up early.

261
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:35,458
You are the only one here.

262
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,542
How can I help you?

263
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:11,417
-I’d like to place a call to Moscow.
<i>-We can only place local calls on base.</i>

264
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:13,292
<i>Only Comrade Semiradov has
access to an outside line.</i>

265
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:15,375
I see. Thank you.

266
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:53,625
Thank you!

267
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:10,792
Please, go.

268
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:30,833
You’re still awake. Excellent!

269
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:50,958
-Has it been long since you had dinner?
-I’m not hungry.

270
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:54,125
When was the last time you ate?

271
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:55,750
I don’t remember. About 4 hours ago.

272
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:48,667
Would you like to see it up close?

273
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:25,875
What is it?

274
00:30:27,417 --> 00:30:28,708
I don’t know.

275
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,375
But it’s clearly not terrestrial.

276
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:35,458
-It lives in Veshnyakov?
-Yes, but Veshnyakov’s better than ever.

277
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:42,208
The creature enters and exits
without harming its carrier.

278
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:45,917
-But what does he think?
-He doesn’t have any idea.

279
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:47,167
What?

280
00:30:48,292 --> 00:30:50,750
Try to understand. We don’t know
what exactly happened in space.

281
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:55,167
We sent two into orbit,
yet three returned to Earth.

282
00:30:58,208 --> 00:30:59,417
Where is the other cosmonaut?

283
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,417
He died.

284
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:04,542
How?

285
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:07,667
Like a hero.

286
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:13,208
I promised you this would interest you.

287
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:20,375
My mission is to find out what happened.
Yours...

288
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:24,625
...is to find a way
to separate parasite and host.

289
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:30,042
Or, sign the nondisclosure agreement
and return home.

290
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:33,958
Why did you entrust this task to me?

291
00:31:34,417 --> 00:31:37,542
I’ve never worked with your office,
with classified material... Why me?

292
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,125
Because of the boy

293
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:43,042
you almost drowned.

294
00:31:44,542 --> 00:31:46,167
You sought someone
who is ready to take risks?

295
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,542
Listen, I have no interest in the process.

296
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:53,583
Tatiana Yurievna, I need results.

297
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:57,167
I found out you saved him.

298
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:59,292
The only one who stepped up and saved him.

299
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:02,458
Please.

300
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,750
Do it again.

301
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:10,750
I need a professional

302
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:13,292
who can save a hero.

303
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:22,000
I need to see all the videotapes
of the creature

304
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,500
and Veshnyakov’s testimony on the landing.

305
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,708
All notes and analyses.
Two sessions a day for an hour each.

306
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,792
After landing, Veshnyakov was sent
to a rehabilitation facility.

307
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:50,583
On the very first night, that creature
emerged and attacked a medical technician.

308
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,958
We had to bring him here
for safety reasons.

309
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:57,833
So far, we have been unable
to find a safe method to separate them.

310
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:01,292
The parasite has succeeded in establishing
a bond with Veshnyakov.

311
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:03,417
We tried to remove it.

312
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:06,333
But without it,
Veshnyakov’s vital signs deteriorate.

313
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:10,583
For it, he’s kind of a spacesuit
against a hostile world.

314
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:15,667
At the same time, the creature gives him
a phenomenal capacity for regeneration.

315
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:19,917
Veshnyakov was seriously injured during
landing, yet recovered in just two days.

316
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:25,333
While incubating, the parasite takes up
just thirty centimeters.

317
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:27,458
It fits in his esophagus and stomach,

318
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,583
increasing the diameter
of the cavities by 30%.

319
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:33,250
When it exits,

320
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:35,542
it exudes a toxin that relaxes

321
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:37,375
Veshnyakov’s muscles and knocks him out.

322
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:44,375
It can expand from its tubular form to 1.5
meters in length, once it ingests oxygen.

323
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:47,208
Then it coils up and returns.

324
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,917
The length and diameter
of its head constantly changes.

325
00:33:52,292 --> 00:33:54,833
For now, it resides outside of Veshnyakov

326
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:56,625
for about 1 hour and 40 to 50 minutes.

327
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,083
It exits consistently between
2:40 to 3:10 at night.

328
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,500
<i>Parasite or symbiote?</i>

329
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:11,750
That’s enough, Konstantin Sergeevich!

330
00:34:12,792 --> 00:34:13,708
I can do more.

331
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:18,042
After your injury,
you should take it easy.

332
00:34:19,542 --> 00:34:24,083
Although the speed of your recovery
has been phenomenal.

333
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:29,583
-How do you feel generally?
-Fine.

334
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,042
I have a tickle in my throat.
Probably I caught a cold.

335
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:36,083
If it continues to bother you, tell Rigel.

336
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:38,042
Okay. See you tomorrow.

337
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:43,333
Tired out, guys? Go home!

338
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:28,917
Can anyone tell me the whereabouts
of Veshnyakov’s son?

339
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:32,333
If I'm not mistaken, they lived in Rostov
when the boy’s mother died?

340
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,250
Is that the only thing you want
to know right now?

341
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,583
Yesterday did you see clearly
what we’re dealing with?

342
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:40,792
What does it feed on?

343
00:35:44,667 --> 00:35:46,167
The same as what Veshnyakov eats.

344
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:50,042
Yan Leonidovich, let’s be clear.

345
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:52,042
I’m not after your job.

346
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:54,000
Or your Nobel Prize.

347
00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:00,167
You have access to the patient,
our analyses, and video recordings.

348
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:04,667
If you need anything else,
ask Comrade Semiradov.

349
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:07,833
Uh-huh... Alright...

350
00:36:16,167 --> 00:36:17,292
Hello, is this the orphanage?

351
00:36:18,292 --> 00:36:21,292
I'm looking for a boy of 7 or 8.
His last name may be Veshnyakov.

352
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:23,417
But not necessarily.

353
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:57,542
Where are you going?

354
00:36:57,958 --> 00:37:00,917
Into everything! Oh, this business!

355
00:37:01,917 --> 00:37:04,042
I leave for a minute, and you run wild!

356
00:37:05,542 --> 00:37:08,417
If I tell Margarita Mikhailovna,
do you know what she'll do?

357
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:12,792
Don't you have anything to say?
I'm talking to you.

358
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:15,417
March to your room!

359
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:26,542
<i>Friends, I believe caravans of rockets</i>

360
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:32,042
<i>Will race us forth from start to star...</i>

361
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:36,333
Don't you like my singing?

362
00:37:38,958 --> 00:37:40,542
I'm sorry, it's for them.

363
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:46,458
You know,

364
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:50,833
there are no greater fans of space songs
than jaded ground personnel.

365
00:37:52,292 --> 00:37:54,208
In space we sing other songs.

366
00:37:54,667 --> 00:37:55,667
Which ones, for example?

367
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:57,167
Any old nonsense.

368
00:37:58,167 --> 00:37:59,417
The melody is the important thing.

369
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:04,542
<i>A million, million,
million scarlet roses...</i>

370
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:10,208
You're drawn to me, right? Admit it.

371
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:15,292
You probably asked to come
to the base yourself. Am I right?

372
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:19,333
The people who brought me here
think you have lost your mind.

373
00:38:20,417 --> 00:38:21,708
What do you mean?

374
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,542
They think you killed
the spaceship co-pilot.

375
00:38:27,042 --> 00:38:28,083
What is she doing?

376
00:38:32,042 --> 00:38:34,000
During landing, an event occurred in space

377
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:36,792
that led to the death of Averchenko.

378
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:40,042
Or, perhaps you killed him.

379
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:43,667
You see, Comrade Semiradov can't
let a hero who's insane

380
00:38:43,708 --> 00:38:45,708
go free into society.

381
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:48,667
Perfect.

382
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:53,625
So, it seems I'm a murderer and insane.

383
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:56,167
Surely you know
not all crazy people look crazy.

384
00:38:56,833 --> 00:39:00,292
Listen, doctor!
You're a sensible person.

385
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:02,292
I prepared for this flight for years.

386
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:04,458
Something went wrong,
and I don't remember what exactly.

387
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:09,208
And that's why they put me
behind armored glass.

388
00:39:11,167 --> 00:39:12,917
Can you tell me
why are they're holding me here?

389
00:39:14,417 --> 00:39:15,833
Can anyone explain?

390
00:39:16,917 --> 00:39:18,083
I'm not a spy

391
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:20,250
-or a wild animal!
-But who are you?

392
00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:21,292
What do you mean?

393
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:25,042
Well, Konstantin Sergeevich Veshnyakov...
Who are you?

394
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:28,833
Read my file.
I'm a hero of the Soviet Union.

395
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:31,667
I could never understand.

396
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:33,875
A grenade attack on a tank is one thing,

397
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:36,667
but you sat in a tin can

398
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,792
at the expense of the government
for a few weeks.

399
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:40,792
What's heroic about that?

400
00:39:41,917 --> 00:39:42,750
What are you saying?

401
00:39:42,792 --> 00:39:44,042
By the way, about your file...

402
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:46,458
Why did you abandon your son?

403
00:39:49,042 --> 00:39:50,042
Let's be clear.

404
00:39:51,792 --> 00:39:53,667
You never married
the mother of your child.

405
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:57,208
After her death,
you could have adopted him.

406
00:39:57,708 --> 00:40:01,042
But you wanted
to be a part of a space crew!

407
00:40:02,042 --> 00:40:06,042
An illegitimate son could blemish
your otherwise perfect reputation.

408
00:40:06,833 --> 00:40:09,042
This is why the boy lives in an orphanage
near Rostov.

409
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:10,333
Am I right?

410
00:40:12,417 --> 00:40:13,917
I also grew up without a father, so what?

411
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:16,667
Did it prevent me from becoming a hero?

412
00:40:17,542 --> 00:40:19,083
Heroes don't abandon their children.

413
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:31,917
You know what, Tatiana Yurievna?

414
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:35,583
I like your pretty face.

415
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:39,042
But from now on,
I prefer that idiot Rigel.

416
00:40:39,917 --> 00:40:41,292
Thank you, the session is over.

417
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:55,792
Have you lost your mind?

418
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:57,875
What the hell were you saying in there?
Who gave you the right?

419
00:40:57,917 --> 00:41:00,167
Test his endocrine profile. Do it now.

420
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:01,750
Do it!

421
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,333
Yesterday I thought
his reactions were a bit too slow.

422
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:06,500
It could be his hormone levels.

423
00:41:06,542 --> 00:41:09,875
This can be tested
after a severe psychological stress.

424
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:12,083
The glands empty into the blood stream.

425
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:14,500
The results of today's tests will show

426
00:41:14,542 --> 00:41:16,667
how and what the creature
inside of him feeds on.

427
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:17,833
Even if it's like photosynthesis!

428
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:21,125
This has no relation to our mission.

429
00:41:21,167 --> 00:41:23,250
We need to remove the parasite.

430
00:41:23,292 --> 00:41:24,083
Comrade Semiradov.

431
00:41:24,458 --> 00:41:26,667
Please order Comrade Veshnyakov
to be transferred

432
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:28,375
to the medical unit during daylight hours

433
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:30,833
and allow him to associate with civilians.

434
00:41:31,792 --> 00:41:33,667
We should attempt
to recreate his normal life

435
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:36,292
to obtain a realistic clinical picture.

436
00:41:39,042 --> 00:41:40,458
"Please order!"

437
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:08,417
What is this?

438
00:42:09,292 --> 00:42:10,708
A reward for good behavior?

439
00:43:16,042 --> 00:43:18,292
<i>We wanted to help you...</i>

440
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:22,500
<i>The Cuban representatives confirmed
the meeting took place as anticipated.</i>

441
00:43:22,542 --> 00:43:25,292
<i>They expressed their gratitude
to Secretary General of the CPSU,</i>

442
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:28,250
<i>Chairman of the Presidium
of the Supreme Council of the USSR,</i>

443
00:43:28,292 --> 00:43:33,292
<i>Yuri Andropov and the entire Soviet
nation for their hospitality.</i>

444
00:43:33,542 --> 00:43:38,292
<i>The Soviet people were equally excited
to welcome back our cosmonauts from orbit.</i>

445
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:43,167
<i>At last, Kirill Averchenko and Konstantin
Veshnyakov have landed safely.</i>

446
00:43:44,167 --> 00:43:46,917
<i>The heroes are in a rehabilitation center</i>

447
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:51,417
<i>where they will recover
from their long stay in weightlessness.</i>

448
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:54,458
<i>In approximately three weeks,</i>

449
00:43:54,917 --> 00:43:57,083
<i>the world will welcome the heroes home.</i>

450
00:43:57,708 --> 00:43:59,083
<i>In brief...</i>

451
00:43:59,542 --> 00:44:02,125
<i>All-Union competitions
between the country's strongest skaters</i>

452
00:44:02,167 --> 00:44:03,667
<i>concluded in Alma-Ata...</i>

453
00:44:12,292 --> 00:44:13,667
What are you doing here?

454
00:44:14,792 --> 00:44:16,208
I owe you an apology.

455
00:44:16,917 --> 00:44:20,417
I provoked you intentionally to measure
your hormone levels under stress.

456
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:33,792
Okay then,
I'll see you at tomorrow's session.

457
00:44:34,667 --> 00:44:35,458
Goodbye until then.

458
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:38,542
I didn't know about the child.

459
00:44:39,792 --> 00:44:40,792
She never told me.

460
00:44:43,542 --> 00:44:44,792
A week before the flight,
they called me

461
00:44:46,167 --> 00:44:47,542
from Rostov. She had died.

462
00:44:47,583 --> 00:44:49,542
The little guy has no other relatives.

463
00:44:49,583 --> 00:44:52,542
He's in an orphanage.
They didn't even tell me his name.

464
00:44:54,542 --> 00:44:55,333
I thought,

465
00:44:57,292 --> 00:44:59,792
when I return, I'll go get him. Or...

466
00:45:01,542 --> 00:45:02,917
... maybe I didn't think anything at all.

467
00:45:05,292 --> 00:45:06,667
What would you have done in my place?

468
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:10,583
I don't know. I don't have children.

469
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:19,667
Tatiana, tell me why you're here.

470
00:45:21,917 --> 00:45:23,417
Not to cure me of amnesia.

471
00:45:25,042 --> 00:45:26,292
What do they want from me?

472
00:45:30,917 --> 00:45:32,417
You can't say or won't?

473
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:35,208
I can't.

474
00:45:38,417 --> 00:45:40,208
But I'll do all I can to help you.

475
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:45,417
Do you think you can help me?

476
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:13,958
Try moving closer.

477
00:46:15,542 --> 00:46:18,042
Try not to say anything
while I'm working.

478
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:22,667
<i>Don't worry! We already confirmed
it has no auditory receptors.</i>

479
00:46:23,667 --> 00:46:24,667
But I do.

480
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:01,292
What are you doing?

481
00:48:07,542 --> 00:48:09,458
<i>Tatiana Yurievna, what are you doing?</i>

482
00:48:11,042 --> 00:48:12,542
Is this thing even working?

483
00:48:14,417 --> 00:48:17,042
<i>-Tatiana Yurievna, what are you doing?
</i>-Can you wait a minute!

484
00:48:42,167 --> 00:48:44,958
<i>-Well, then. If you're finished...
-Raise the glass.</i>

485
00:48:46,708 --> 00:48:47,583
What?

486
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:49,792
Raise it!

487
00:48:57,292 --> 00:48:58,167
Are you certain?

488
00:48:59,583 --> 00:49:00,417
Yes.

489
00:49:00,917 --> 00:49:02,208
No! It's too...

490
00:49:04,583 --> 00:49:05,708
Then put on a protective suit.

491
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:14,042
Get her out of there!

492
00:52:35,417 --> 00:52:37,708
We have a shortage
of flower shops around here.

493
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:40,583
I picked what I could.

494
00:52:41,042 --> 00:52:43,417
-How do you feel?
-I'm fine. Thank you!

495
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:47,042
You are truly a brave lady.

496
00:52:47,917 --> 00:52:50,583
Now at least we know what not to do.

497
00:52:52,208 --> 00:52:54,042
Veshnyakov isn't fully unconscious.

498
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:55,792
I see...

499
00:52:56,417 --> 00:52:58,458
Can you be more specific?

500
00:52:59,792 --> 00:53:01,167
That toy reminds him

501
00:53:01,542 --> 00:53:04,042
of the guilt he feels towards his son.

502
00:53:04,667 --> 00:53:06,625
Do you mean the creature

503
00:53:06,667 --> 00:53:10,292
reacted to the toy
because it means a lot to Veshnyakov?

504
00:53:10,833 --> 00:53:13,667
I mean the creature
and Veshnyakov are a single entity.

505
00:53:13,917 --> 00:53:15,208
They share the same conscious mind.

506
00:53:16,042 --> 00:53:19,958
The creature partially blunts
his memories and social skills.

507
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:22,750
Every night it spends
a few more minutes longer

508
00:53:22,792 --> 00:53:24,292
outside Veshnyakov's body.

509
00:53:24,542 --> 00:53:27,292
At some point it will no longer need him
like a butterfly sheds its cocoon.

510
00:53:27,333 --> 00:53:28,542
We have to do something.

511
00:53:28,917 --> 00:53:30,375
We need more resources.

512
00:53:30,417 --> 00:53:31,875
He must be taken to Moscow.

513
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:32,833
To Moscow?

514
00:53:33,917 --> 00:53:37,917
Tatiana Yurievna,
why do you think we're not there now?

515
00:53:39,292 --> 00:53:41,458
We know nothing about this creature:

516
00:53:42,583 --> 00:53:45,042
whether it's a grown specimen

517
00:53:45,083 --> 00:53:46,958
or a nymph that might grow

518
00:53:47,333 --> 00:53:51,083
into something that dwarfs us.

519
00:53:51,917 --> 00:53:53,792
I am obliged to preserve
the ability to destroy it,

520
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:55,917
if it becomes uncontrollable.

521
00:53:56,167 --> 00:53:57,875
We are risking the life of a human being.

522
00:53:57,917 --> 00:53:59,625
A cosmonaut.
A hero of the Soviet Union.

523
00:53:59,667 --> 00:54:00,917
A hero

524
00:54:01,417 --> 00:54:02,958
is prepared for anything.

525
00:54:04,083 --> 00:54:06,125
Including self-sacrifice.

526
00:54:06,167 --> 00:54:09,875
Every day I send fake reports
on our accomplishments

527
00:54:09,917 --> 00:54:10,958
to Moscow.

528
00:54:11,542 --> 00:54:12,667
What he eats.

529
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:16,167
Details of his pulse, feces, mood.
Anything I can make up.

530
00:54:17,042 --> 00:54:20,792
To avoid the order to destroy him.

531
00:54:21,833 --> 00:54:23,917
I should be court-martialed already.

532
00:54:26,542 --> 00:54:29,417
I hoped you were also ready
to do anything.

533
00:54:39,583 --> 00:54:40,667
May I?

534
00:55:04,458 --> 00:55:06,208
-Yan Leonidovich!
-What?

535
00:55:06,958 --> 00:55:08,042
Doesn't this alarm you?

536
00:55:13,042 --> 00:55:14,417
Maybe there's been a technical mistake?

537
00:55:17,458 --> 00:55:19,750
Veshnyakov's hormone levels

538
00:55:19,792 --> 00:55:22,042
are radically different
at morning and night.

539
00:55:22,542 --> 00:55:24,458
At night he appears to get much worse.

540
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:27,292
I keep wondering,
when does he get that boost?

541
00:55:30,042 --> 00:55:32,208
I'm not an endocrinologist,
Tatiana Yurievna.

542
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:35,250
Do your work and figure it out.

543
00:55:35,292 --> 00:55:36,417
You edited parts of the videotapes.

544
00:55:38,083 --> 00:55:40,667
Don't tell me this creature eats
what Veshnyakov does.

545
00:55:41,042 --> 00:55:42,667
What are you feeding it? Pigs?

546
00:55:43,917 --> 00:55:45,250
If I'm leading an investigation,

547
00:55:45,292 --> 00:55:46,958
why is everything hidden from me?

548
00:55:48,292 --> 00:55:49,583
Isn't that enough for you?

549
00:55:52,542 --> 00:55:53,667
Do you want my advice?

550
00:55:55,167 --> 00:55:57,292
Go back to Moscow while you still can.

551
00:55:57,583 --> 00:55:59,083
Forget what you've seen here.

552
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:01,875
When the review board comes,
we'll all be reported.

553
00:56:01,917 --> 00:56:03,667
Will you torture him with hypnosis
for the review board?

554
00:56:05,167 --> 00:56:07,708
I know what's keeping you here!
You want a Nobel Prize.

555
00:56:10,542 --> 00:56:12,292
You won't make any progress without me.

556
00:56:13,833 --> 00:56:16,583
To do so, I need access
to all the information.

557
00:56:19,833 --> 00:56:22,417
There is no need
for Comrade Semiradov to know.

558
00:56:56,417 --> 00:56:57,417
What, are you serious?

559
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:21,208
Open the gates!

560
00:57:23,042 --> 00:57:24,042
Open the gates!

561
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:10,833
Don't waste your chance.

562
00:58:11,333 --> 00:58:13,708
The battery lasts
for only about ten minutes.

563
00:58:41,667 --> 00:58:44,667
Where are you taking me? Why am I here?

564
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:03,042
No!

565
00:59:03,083 --> 00:59:03,917
No!

566
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,167
Don't!

567
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:23,458
Light!

568
01:01:08,833 --> 01:01:10,042
Stop the camera!

569
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:48,458
Before he was brought here,

570
01:01:49,292 --> 01:01:50,833
the creature attacked a medic.

571
01:01:51,292 --> 01:01:53,208
You saw the video...

572
01:01:54,458 --> 01:01:56,958
...but you didn't see
Veshnyakov's vital signs.

573
01:01:57,958 --> 01:02:00,708
His condition immediately
improved after the murder.

574
01:02:01,292 --> 01:02:02,958
We tried feeding it everything -

575
01:02:03,208 --> 01:02:04,708
from lab rats

576
01:02:06,833 --> 01:02:08,083
to pigs.

577
01:02:08,917 --> 01:02:09,708
And then

578
01:02:10,042 --> 01:02:14,542
Semiradov ordered that one convict be sent
into the enclosure.

579
01:02:16,292 --> 01:02:17,917
Veshnyakov's hormone levels improved.

580
01:02:18,708 --> 01:02:21,042
You got me thinking about hormones...

581
01:02:22,083 --> 01:02:23,708
Did you see how it behaves
in the enclosure?

582
01:02:25,583 --> 01:02:27,083
It doesn't just need to kill.

583
01:02:28,458 --> 01:02:31,292
It's important for the victim to see it

584
01:02:32,792 --> 01:02:33,833
and become afraid.

585
01:02:36,042 --> 01:02:40,333
The highly developed human brain
releases a lot of cortisol when afraid.

586
01:02:42,167 --> 01:02:44,333
On this planet, we are the champions

587
01:02:45,292 --> 01:02:47,167
when it comes to fear.

588
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:51,333
This creature

589
01:02:52,542 --> 01:02:54,333
essentially feeds on cortisol.

590
01:03:01,917 --> 01:03:03,583
We are on the edge of a great discovery!

591
01:03:06,042 --> 01:03:07,917
If we combine forces...

592
01:03:07,958 --> 01:03:09,208
Rigel! You're killing people.

593
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:15,208
Not me,

594
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,458
this is all Semiradov's doing.

595
01:03:19,167 --> 01:03:20,708
What, do you think I'm a monster?

596
01:03:21,167 --> 01:03:22,583
You're not a monster, you're a coward.

597
01:03:24,292 --> 01:03:25,958
A highly adaptive and hardy specimen.

598
01:03:37,167 --> 01:03:38,667
<i>You can't stay here any longer.</i>

599
01:03:38,708 --> 01:03:40,875
<i>It's a terrible place.
They're gonna kill you.</i>

600
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:42,042
<i>Let's go.</i>

601
01:03:42,083 --> 01:03:44,167
<i>I can't.</i>

602
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:46,792
<i>-Go to Astra.
-Listen to me.</i>

603
01:03:47,208 --> 01:03:48,458
<i>You are not a robot, but a human being.</i>

604
01:03:48,708 --> 01:03:50,458
<i>Don't you understand?</i>

605
01:03:50,958 --> 01:03:52,708
<i>Let’s go.</i>

606
01:03:53,708 --> 01:03:54,583
Good morning!

607
01:03:55,417 --> 01:03:56,208
Morning!

608
01:03:58,208 --> 01:04:00,667
To be honest, I prefer war films.

609
01:04:00,958 --> 01:04:02,208
Or ones about spies.

610
01:04:03,833 --> 01:04:04,958
What movies do you like?

611
01:04:06,083 --> 01:04:08,208
Don't you need to get back
in shape after your injury?

612
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:09,583
Want to go for a run?

613
01:04:13,708 --> 01:04:15,792
What, are we going to run
around in a circle, like gym class?

614
01:04:15,833 --> 01:04:17,458
We'll push the TV into the corner.

615
01:04:19,208 --> 01:04:20,708
I received permission
to exit the compound.

616
01:04:32,458 --> 01:04:33,958
You look good in sports clothes!

617
01:04:34,583 --> 01:04:36,083
Did you ever think to try track and field?

618
01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:37,833
No.

619
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:40,208
We should try when I'm released.

620
01:04:41,083 --> 01:04:42,833
We can no longer
compete professionally,

621
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:44,958
but why not try amateur sports!

622
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:48,250
Listen to me carefully!

623
01:04:48,292 --> 01:04:50,917
You brought back a passenger
from outer space. It's inside of you.

624
01:04:51,333 --> 01:04:52,708
They feed people to it alive.

625
01:04:53,917 --> 01:04:55,167
We can separate you from it,

626
01:04:55,208 --> 01:04:57,583
but we have to find someone
who can inform the government!

627
01:05:06,583 --> 01:05:07,708
Can you hear me?

628
01:05:14,583 --> 01:05:16,167
-Are you being watched?
-I don't know.

629
01:05:16,542 --> 01:05:19,167
-At night? Did they assign you a guard?
-I don't know.

630
01:05:19,208 --> 01:05:21,333
Find out!
If not, meet me at 1 AM in my block.

631
01:05:23,833 --> 01:05:24,917
That's all, Dr.

632
01:05:25,417 --> 01:05:26,417
I'm exhausted.

633
01:05:27,208 --> 01:05:28,208
Time to sleep!

634
01:06:15,208 --> 01:06:16,333
You also can't sleep?

635
01:06:18,083 --> 01:06:19,333
You're not allowed in the hallway.

636
01:06:20,667 --> 01:06:21,583
I know.

637
01:06:24,042 --> 01:06:25,208
What a life, right?

638
01:06:25,833 --> 01:06:28,833
I can go into space,
but not into the hallway.

639
01:06:33,042 --> 01:06:34,083
Konstantin Sergeevich.

640
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:38,208
What do you think,

641
01:06:39,542 --> 01:06:41,958
-is anyone out there?
-Where?

642
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:43,583
In the sky.

643
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:45,458
Do you believe in God?

644
01:06:48,542 --> 01:06:49,958
I believe in what I can see.

645
01:06:51,208 --> 01:06:52,083
I didn't see God there.

646
01:06:57,333 --> 01:06:58,208
You know what?

647
01:06:59,083 --> 01:07:00,167
I say it's your break time.

648
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:02,833
Come watch a movie.

649
01:07:03,208 --> 01:07:05,917
They gave me a VCR,
but it's boring to watch alone.

650
01:07:05,958 --> 01:07:07,292
I'm not allowed.

651
01:07:07,333 --> 01:07:08,292
Come on!

652
01:07:08,833 --> 01:07:10,333
Konstantin Sergeevich, I'm not allowed!

653
01:07:14,083 --> 01:07:17,708
<i>And the entire planet will enjoy
the pure air!</i>

654
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:19,417
<b><i>Come on.</i></b>

655
01:07:29,333 --> 01:07:30,833
<b><i>What's wrong?</i></b>

656
01:07:32,917 --> 01:07:34,583
<i>-I'll stay by your side.
-I am all alone.</i>

657
01:07:35,583 --> 01:07:37,333
<i>-That's not true.
-I am all alone.</i>

658
01:07:38,458 --> 01:07:40,208
<i>I was produced to no purpose.</i>

659
01:08:28,707 --> 01:08:29,792
I don't get it...

660
01:10:26,708 --> 01:10:27,708
Amusing, right?

661
01:10:31,083 --> 01:10:33,708
My whole life I dreamed of having
my legacy displayed in a museum.

662
01:10:41,833 --> 01:10:43,417
Can you feel what that creature feels?

663
01:10:45,333 --> 01:10:46,583
I am that creature.

664
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:51,042
Without morals or obligations.

665
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:56,542
I feel everything it does.

666
01:10:57,958 --> 01:10:59,417
I remember everything in minute detail.

667
01:11:02,583 --> 01:11:04,417
Everything it sees, stays with me.

668
01:11:06,917 --> 01:11:08,708
You knew from the beginning!
Why didn't you say?

669
01:11:09,417 --> 01:11:10,583
Why do you think?

670
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:14,333
If Semiradov knew,

671
01:11:15,708 --> 01:11:17,083
he'd never let me go.

672
01:11:37,583 --> 01:11:39,083
My co-pilot Comrade Averchenko.

673
01:11:45,833 --> 01:11:47,042
Help me, Tanya!

674
01:11:48,833 --> 01:11:50,542
To hold on just two more weeks.

675
01:11:53,083 --> 01:11:54,583
Just continue on as you have been.

676
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:57,208
Semiradov will have no choice.

677
01:11:59,333 --> 01:12:01,708
A review board will arrive from Moscow.
We'll be released.

678
01:12:02,333 --> 01:12:04,208
But before then,
he should not know that I...

679
01:12:08,542 --> 01:12:09,917
I don't want to end up like him.

680
01:12:13,042 --> 01:12:15,583
It will kill people for two more weeks.

681
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:18,417
How can you endure that!

682
01:12:19,792 --> 01:12:21,458
What would you have done in my place?

683
01:12:21,958 --> 01:12:23,333
Smashed your head in against the wall?

684
01:12:24,458 --> 01:12:25,292
Yes!

685
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:28,792
I didn't decide to feed it people.

686
01:12:29,833 --> 01:12:31,833
I can't be responsible for that.

687
01:12:33,208 --> 01:12:35,958
I haven't endured so much,
just to die out here in the steppe.

688
01:12:38,042 --> 01:12:39,333
My mother lives alone

689
01:12:40,417 --> 01:12:41,708
and I need to get home.

690
01:12:42,292 --> 01:12:43,458
I must survive.

691
01:12:45,208 --> 01:12:46,458
I need to collect my son.

692
01:12:49,583 --> 01:12:52,708
Now I understand why that creature
chose you and not Averchenko!

693
01:12:54,208 --> 01:12:55,542
You mean I'm a monster?

694
01:12:56,417 --> 01:12:58,917
And you, a princess?

695
01:13:00,333 --> 01:13:02,792
While you all sat cozy and warm
in your offices,

696
01:13:03,333 --> 01:13:06,667
I prepared for this flight,
a heroic accomplishment.

697
01:13:07,708 --> 01:13:09,958
And now you all tell me I should die.

698
01:13:14,583 --> 01:13:15,708
It's your dinner time.

699
01:13:57,708 --> 01:14:01,083
Where are you going? Such a pain!
You haven't killed yourself yet?

700
01:14:01,458 --> 01:14:02,708
Give it to me.

701
01:14:04,167 --> 01:14:07,792
You saw it, huh?
He is like a little animal.

702
01:14:07,833 --> 01:14:09,917
I don't seem to remember this one.
He's from which group?

703
01:14:09,958 --> 01:14:11,708
The invalid group.
Just take a look at his feet!

704
01:14:12,958 --> 01:14:14,208
This one's a nutcase.

705
01:14:14,708 --> 01:14:16,083
Look, he scratched me to blood.

706
01:14:35,708 --> 01:14:36,625
Comrade Colonel.

707
01:14:37,667 --> 01:14:38,625
You may go!

708
01:14:43,875 --> 01:14:46,625
You and I, Tatiana Yurievna, never got off
to a good start.

709
01:14:47,875 --> 01:14:49,917
I should have told you everything.

710
01:14:50,708 --> 01:14:51,625
What in particular?

711
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,167
That you feed people
to that creature alive?

712
01:14:54,208 --> 01:14:57,958
We don't know how much
that creature will adapt.

713
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,042
The victor will be the one
who can control it.

714
01:15:02,208 --> 01:15:04,292
We must learn to control it.

715
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,417
Is that the only thing you care about?
Weapons?

716
01:15:07,667 --> 01:15:08,500
Yes.

717
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:14,000
Do you know why we need weapons?

718
01:15:16,542 --> 01:15:18,292
Weapons guarantee peace.

719
01:15:18,875 --> 01:15:21,833
A pack of dogs would tear
each other to pieces.

720
01:15:22,292 --> 01:15:24,875
In order to live in peace,
they need one leader.

721
01:15:26,083 --> 01:15:27,458
You feed it people.

722
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:29,333
People...

723
01:15:40,458 --> 01:15:43,333
Sergey Gennadievich Kovalyev.
Born in 1952.

724
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:46,292
Convicted by law 103, 117,

725
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:47,917
77 part one.

726
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:50,333
He raped and killed his neighbor,

727
01:15:50,375 --> 01:15:52,125
a 12-year-old girl.

728
01:15:52,167 --> 01:15:53,458
These are not people!

729
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:57,083
People are those who died in Angola
and who die in Afghanistan now.

730
01:15:57,125 --> 01:15:58,000
These are fodder!

731
01:15:59,583 --> 01:16:02,000
If the authorities find out,
they'll court-martial you.

732
01:16:05,333 --> 01:16:07,625
Yes.

733
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,583
We don't like initiative.

734
01:16:11,208 --> 01:16:14,625
But doctors and soldiers sometimes
must make difficult decisions.

735
01:16:15,417 --> 01:16:17,875
Victors are not judged.

736
01:16:19,083 --> 01:16:20,667
I'm ready to take responsibility.

737
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,083
You're the same, Tatiana.

738
01:16:25,458 --> 01:16:26,375
You don't know me.

739
01:16:26,417 --> 01:16:27,458
You...

740
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,292
You don't know yourself.

741
01:16:30,125 --> 01:16:32,333
Come on, I'll show you
the feeding up close.

742
01:16:32,833 --> 01:16:35,708
No need to sit in the back
of a car with binoculars.

743
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Comrade Semiradov.

744
01:16:59,667 --> 01:17:01,583
She allowed herself to go too far.

745
01:17:01,625 --> 01:17:03,833
But it was for the greater good.

746
01:17:03,875 --> 01:17:06,750
Yan Leonidovich, doesn't your conscience
trouble you at night?

747
01:17:07,292 --> 01:17:08,792
M...me?

748
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:10,667
You showed her the feeding session.

749
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
You disobeyed an order.

750
01:18:03,208 --> 01:18:04,208
Please, don't!

751
01:18:05,083 --> 01:18:06,292
I'll find another way.

752
01:18:07,833 --> 01:18:09,875
In the short term, unlikely.

753
01:18:22,125 --> 01:18:23,042
Open up!

754
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:46,000
I'm not afraid...

755
01:18:52,417 --> 01:18:53,333
It's me.

756
01:18:59,917 --> 01:19:00,792
It's me.

757
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:12,583
<i>A million, million, million scarlet roses</i>

758
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:18,333
<i>From the window, from the window you see</i>

759
01:19:27,833 --> 01:19:29,417
<i>Who's in love, who's in love</i>

760
01:19:36,292 --> 01:19:37,792
<i>A million</i>

761
01:19:39,667 --> 01:19:41,833
<i>A million scarlet roses</i>

762
01:19:44,292 --> 01:19:46,167
<i>From the window, from the window...</i>

763
01:19:48,125 --> 01:19:49,542
It adapted.

764
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:54,833
Now it can hear.

765
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:01,958
<i>He transformed his life into flowers</i>

766
01:20:02,792 --> 01:20:03,708
<i>For you</i>

767
01:20:09,833 --> 01:20:14,208
<i>Who's in love, who's in love deeply...</i>

768
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:40,667
No!

769
01:21:06,833 --> 01:21:09,417
Can Veshnyakov control it?

770
01:21:14,542 --> 01:21:15,375
No.

771
01:21:17,958 --> 01:21:18,833
Not yet.

772
01:21:24,917 --> 01:21:26,583
I need results, Tatiana Yurievna.

773
01:21:28,542 --> 01:21:30,833
You must learn to control him.

774
01:21:31,542 --> 01:21:33,458
That will be difficult without you.

775
01:21:34,417 --> 01:21:36,875
Let's forget our differences

776
01:21:36,917 --> 01:21:40,167
and work together openly.

777
01:21:41,083 --> 01:21:42,583
I take full responsibility.

778
01:21:43,208 --> 01:21:45,417
You can say that I forced you.

779
01:21:47,542 --> 01:21:49,958
If things go well,
we'll have an amazing weapon.

780
01:21:51,583 --> 01:21:52,500
Will you help?

781
01:22:05,625 --> 01:22:06,833
Tatiana Yurievna!

782
01:22:07,875 --> 01:22:10,125
Do you know why it chose Veshnyakov,
and not Averchenko?

783
01:22:15,458 --> 01:22:16,792
He was in the early stages of cancer.

784
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:20,250
With a kidney tumor
that caused Addison's disease.

785
01:22:21,125 --> 01:22:24,167
We couldn't detect it prior to lift-off.
But the creature could.

786
01:22:24,917 --> 01:22:28,500
His body suppressed
high concentrations of cortisol.

787
01:22:28,542 --> 01:22:31,750
That's why it couldn't establish
a complete symbiotic bond.

788
01:22:34,042 --> 01:22:34,875
Come here.

789
01:22:39,542 --> 01:22:41,292
Metyrapone and Trilostane,
four milliliters...

790
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:44,708
[Latin] And some strong sedative.

791
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,042
[Latin] At 2 AM. By the medical unit.

792
01:22:48,958 --> 01:22:50,125
Trilostane?

793
01:22:50,667 --> 01:22:52,458
[Latin] Tonight.
We will attempt an escape. With you.

794
01:22:57,875 --> 01:22:58,958
[Latin] Not me.

795
01:22:59,833 --> 01:23:01,625
Be a man, after all.

796
01:23:01,958 --> 01:23:03,292
You're a scientist, not any old doctor.

797
01:23:04,708 --> 01:23:05,542
Look here.

798
01:23:06,583 --> 01:23:07,458
See the tongue?

799
01:23:09,625 --> 01:23:10,750
Don't be afraid, Comrade Rigel.

800
01:23:11,333 --> 01:23:12,167
[Latin] Help us.

801
01:23:30,583 --> 01:23:33,958
If you escape, say he made me do it.

802
01:23:36,292 --> 01:23:38,708
Or if you don't, that I didn't know.

803
01:23:42,042 --> 01:23:43,917
Thank you, colleague.
You helped me a lot.

804
01:23:50,833 --> 01:23:52,625
Are you allergic to Buspironum?

805
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,167
Me? I don't think so...

806
01:23:55,083 --> 01:23:56,708
You... What...

807
01:23:57,375 --> 01:23:58,250
What are you doing?

808
01:24:03,125 --> 01:24:04,833
Make up your mind, Comrade Rigel.

809
01:24:04,875 --> 01:24:06,250
You didn't know or you were forced?

810
01:24:15,958 --> 01:24:17,125
Watch the door.

811
01:24:28,125 --> 01:24:29,167
We have little time,

812
01:24:29,625 --> 01:24:30,792
so listen carefully.

813
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:32,750
No review board is coming here.

814
01:24:33,208 --> 01:24:35,375
Semiradov will do anything
to keep that creature here.

815
01:24:36,958 --> 01:24:38,542
I know how to separate you.

816
01:24:38,792 --> 01:24:40,250
Why did you enter the enclosure?

817
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:41,958
I could have killed you.

818
01:24:42,625 --> 01:24:45,167
But you didn't. You like me too.

819
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:49,125
This is a mix of hormones.

820
01:24:49,583 --> 01:24:52,708
It will imitate the effects of Addison's
disease, which Averchenko suffered from.

821
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:56,875
The injection will force
the creature to exit you.

822
01:24:57,375 --> 01:24:59,125
Without you,
it can live no more than an hour.

823
01:24:59,417 --> 01:25:01,917
You'll survive much longer. We just
need to make it to an emergency room.

824
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:05,333
And if you are wrong?

825
01:25:06,583 --> 01:25:08,125
If it's already acclimatized?

826
01:25:09,375 --> 01:25:10,625
We'll be letting it go free!

827
01:25:12,125 --> 01:25:13,958
We'll give you a shot,
when we get a safe distance away.

828
01:25:14,333 --> 01:25:17,083
Where there's no people.
It's weaker in the sunlight.

829
01:25:20,083 --> 01:25:20,917
No.

830
01:25:25,708 --> 01:25:26,542
No.

831
01:25:32,958 --> 01:25:34,458
We just need
to make it to a real hospital.

832
01:25:36,792 --> 01:25:38,000
I'll be able to think of something.

833
01:25:38,875 --> 01:25:39,792
I'll find a way out of this.

834
01:25:42,292 --> 01:25:43,125
Why?

835
01:25:45,875 --> 01:25:47,042
Tatiana, you don't understand.

836
01:25:48,125 --> 01:25:49,875
I don't need to be taken anywhere.

837
01:25:51,042 --> 01:25:52,792
The creature doesn't harm me at all.

838
01:25:53,625 --> 01:25:54,875
To the contrary, it saved my life.

839
01:25:55,833 --> 01:25:56,875
You don't believe that.

840
01:26:01,417 --> 01:26:02,250
Leave already!

841
01:26:08,583 --> 01:26:09,458
I'm not afraid of them!

842
01:26:10,125 --> 01:26:12,708
Be afraid of me! It chose me!

843
01:26:13,167 --> 01:26:14,000
It is not you.

844
01:26:24,917 --> 01:26:25,750
It's me!

845
01:26:29,208 --> 01:26:30,458
It's my punishment!

846
01:26:32,125 --> 01:26:33,208
I abandoned my son.

847
01:26:34,917 --> 01:26:36,458
I chose space instead.

848
01:26:38,417 --> 01:26:39,667
I deserve this, you understand?

849
01:26:41,708 --> 01:26:42,542
That's all. Go!

850
01:26:45,292 --> 01:26:46,208
Lyosha!

851
01:26:49,042 --> 01:26:49,875
What?

852
01:26:51,083 --> 01:26:52,167
His name is Lyosha.

853
01:26:55,667 --> 01:26:57,250
Aleksei Konstantinovich Romanov.

854
01:27:04,208 --> 01:27:05,458
He'll be seven next week.

855
01:27:32,875 --> 01:27:34,042
There's a car by the enclosure.

856
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:36,333
They'll kill you here. Come with us.

857
01:27:37,125 --> 01:27:40,417
Don't worry. I'm a highly adaptive

858
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:43,167
and hardy specimen.

859
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:49,917
Thank you!

860
01:28:28,167 --> 01:28:29,958
This Dr. Rigel, from Base ALFA 4.

861
01:28:31,083 --> 01:28:33,542
Please, connect me
to the operative on duty.

862
01:28:33,583 --> 01:28:35,500
I have very important information.

863
01:28:38,167 --> 01:28:39,583
-What is it?
-They're in the enclosure.

864
01:28:40,333 --> 01:28:41,792
Veshnyakov and Dr. Klimova.

865
01:28:44,708 --> 01:28:46,208
Send the response team.

866
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:49,083
Do not shoot Veshnyakov. Terminate her.

867
01:28:57,833 --> 01:28:58,792
Stop!

868
01:29:02,542 --> 01:29:04,833
Veshnyakov!
Take two steps to the right! Lie down!

869
01:29:07,125 --> 01:29:09,667
Drop your weapons
and no one will get hurt!

870
01:29:13,417 --> 01:29:14,750
-Don't shoot!
-Fire!

871
01:29:17,125 --> 01:29:20,917
And he... he ordered
they be listed as victims of a fire.

872
01:29:30,125 --> 01:29:31,917
But those people were killed outright.

873
01:29:31,958 --> 01:29:34,625
For now, there are seven victims
from the convicts.

874
01:29:44,833 --> 01:29:46,125
Did you have enough time?

875
01:29:47,375 --> 01:29:49,083
Did you manage to call them?

876
01:29:54,583 --> 01:29:56,625
You're no hero, Yan!

877
01:29:57,750 --> 01:29:58,833
I could tell immediately.

878
01:29:58,875 --> 01:30:01,042
You have no resemblance to them.

879
01:30:01,833 --> 01:30:03,167
But you'll have an honorable death.

880
01:30:03,208 --> 01:30:04,958
Out of respect
for your scientific endeavors.

881
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:22,708
The syringe!

882
01:30:23,917 --> 01:30:24,750
No.

883
01:30:25,542 --> 01:30:26,833
-Not yet.
-The syringe.

884
01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:39,083
Come on!

885
01:30:40,625 --> 01:30:41,458
Faster!

886
01:31:47,875 --> 01:31:49,000
Run!

887
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,458
Fire!

888
01:32:30,542 --> 01:32:33,917
<i>If you find the fugitives, take
</i>all possible measures to detain them.

889
01:32:39,667 --> 01:32:41,167
-Pull over!
-Get out of here!

890
01:32:51,458 --> 01:32:52,375
As you were!

891
01:34:37,333 --> 01:34:38,333
Kostya!

892
01:34:41,250 --> 01:34:42,083
Sorry!

893
01:34:42,958 --> 01:34:43,750
What are you doing?

894
01:34:44,833 --> 01:34:46,333
Your condition worsened!

895
01:34:46,625 --> 01:34:47,750
You won't survive without it.

896
01:34:48,333 --> 01:34:49,583
We can still leave...

897
01:34:50,333 --> 01:34:51,125
We can do it!

898
01:36:13,708 --> 01:36:16,083
Have you changed your mind,
Tatiana Yurievna?

899
01:36:17,833 --> 01:36:19,000
I was mistaken.

900
01:36:23,708 --> 01:36:24,875
They can't be separated.

901
01:36:31,083 --> 01:36:32,625
They have become fully symbiotic.

902
01:36:34,083 --> 01:36:35,458
They'll die without each other.

903
01:36:36,333 --> 01:36:38,500
Well, no matter.

904
01:36:39,333 --> 01:36:40,583
Everyone makes mistakes.

905
01:36:47,875 --> 01:36:50,458
We won't let them die, right?

906
01:36:58,583 --> 01:37:00,875
Do you know what your problem is?

907
01:37:01,708 --> 01:37:04,708
You try to save everyone!

908
01:37:06,083 --> 01:37:06,958
But that's impossible.

909
01:37:09,333 --> 01:37:11,958
You must always choose.

910
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:08,875
He's gone.

911
01:39:13,708 --> 01:39:15,083
We can separate you.

912
01:39:17,458 --> 01:39:18,458
We'll try in Moscow.

913
01:39:21,625 --> 01:39:22,708
It'll be OK.

914
01:39:23,333 --> 01:39:24,250
I know.

915
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:26,958
We'll think of something.

916
01:39:43,875 --> 01:39:44,833
I already have.

917
01:40:53,750 --> 01:41:00,458
{\an8}ROSTOV-ON-DON

918
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,833
Why do you keep coming back
here like a bee to the flower?

919
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:34,958
Why won't you lie calmly?
Why this running?

920
01:41:36,833 --> 01:41:38,208
Why on earth do you need those?

921
01:41:38,750 --> 01:41:39,875
Where are you going like that?

922
01:41:42,333 --> 01:41:44,000
Do you have parents?

923
01:42:00,708 --> 01:42:01,625
Go on!

924
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:04,583
But just play around the complex, OK?

925
01:42:04,625 --> 01:42:06,208
Or they'll take away my award.

926
01:42:32,208 --> 01:42:33,833
Hello! Tatiana Klimova.

927
01:42:34,333 --> 01:42:36,083
I'm here to adopt Lyosha Romanov.

928
01:43:08,625 --> 01:43:09,833
No problem!

929
01:43:10,458 --> 01:43:11,708
God loves everyone.

930
01:43:12,833 --> 01:43:14,958
I've done this sedentary job twenty years.

931
01:43:15,708 --> 01:43:16,958
And it's fine.

932
01:43:18,583 --> 01:43:20,500
You're going to be alright, little fellow.

933
01:43:22,958 --> 01:43:24,083
I'm not a boy.

934
01:43:24,833 --> 01:43:26,208
My name is Tanya.

935
01:43:57,500 --> 01:43:58,583
So you're Lyosha?

936
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:03,583
My name is Tanya.

937
01:44:06,875 --> 01:44:08,083
