00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:24,473
Mama?

3
00:01:24,475 --> 00:01:26,177
Bartolo?

4
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,416
Mama?

5
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:46,127
Mama?

6
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:48,198
Bartolo?

7
00:01:53,636 --> 00:01:55,172
Mama?

8
00:01:56,172 --> 00:01:57,672
Bartolo?

9
00:02:17,026 --> 00:02:18,728
Mama, no!

10
00:02:27,838 --> 00:02:29,173
Sam, come on.
We're late.

11
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:41,081
Guys, the bus is almost here.

12
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,717
Chris, in case I'm late
for any reason,

13
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,818
there's dinner in the fridge.

14
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,219
Meatloaf. Got it.

15
00:02:45,221 --> 00:02:46,688
Misty!

16
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,889
Sorry, sweetie.

17
00:02:47,891 --> 00:02:49,256
Mom, where's my jacket?

18
00:02:49,258 --> 00:02:50,992
It's in the closet
upstairs.

19
00:02:50,994 --> 00:02:52,294
Quick, quick, quick.

20
00:02:52,296 --> 00:02:53,994
Lunchbox.

21
00:02:53,996 --> 00:02:56,564
All right. Okay.
I got my keys.

22
00:02:56,566 --> 00:02:58,300
And... No.

23
00:02:58,302 --> 00:03:00,034
No, no, honey,
I already packed it.

24
00:03:00,036 --> 00:03:01,938
Here you go.
Take your backpack. Let's go.

25
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:05,272
Chris? Let's go.

26
00:03:05,274 --> 00:03:07,575
Come on, guys.
Oh, I see it.

27
00:03:07,577 --> 00:03:10,111
What? Honey, no,
you can't wear these.

28
00:03:10,113 --> 00:03:11,883
Okay.
We're gonna miss the bus.

29
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,119
Let's go, let's go,
let's go. Come on.

30
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:17,752
Shit!

31
00:03:17,754 --> 00:03:18,822
Language, Mom.

32
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:34,605
Department
of Social Services.

33
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:36,070
Oh, Donna,

34
00:03:36,072 --> 00:03:37,738
what's the latest
from the Alvarez case?

35
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,839
I called several times.

36
00:03:38,841 --> 00:03:40,909
She's not answering the phone.

37
00:03:40,911 --> 00:03:42,843
I'm taking patrol over there.
Something's up at that house.

38
00:03:42,845 --> 00:03:44,278
Patricia Alvarez?

39
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,747
Why? What's going on?

40
00:03:45,749 --> 00:03:47,115
We got a call from the school.

41
00:03:47,117 --> 00:03:48,849
Alvarez boys
aren't going to class again.

42
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:50,184
Okay, well,
why is Donna going over there?

43
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:51,952
I transferred
some of your cases.

44
00:03:51,954 --> 00:03:53,121
Now, Donna has more energy.

45
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:54,723
More energy?
And more time.

46
00:03:54,725 --> 00:03:57,058
She doesn't have the outside
responsibilities you have.

47
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,260
She has no kids.
She has support at home.

48
00:03:59,262 --> 00:04:00,764
'Cause her husband isn't dead.

49
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:06,735
She was on time
every day this week.

50
00:04:06,737 --> 00:04:09,371
All right? But believe me,
we all understand.

51
00:04:09,373 --> 00:04:10,804
Do you?

52
00:04:10,806 --> 00:04:12,643
Doesn't really feel like it.

53
00:04:13,876 --> 00:04:15,643
Less time here,
more time at home

54
00:04:15,645 --> 00:04:16,844
might not be such a bad thing.

55
00:04:16,846 --> 00:04:19,113
Patricia Alvarez isn't gonna
talk to someone like Donna.

56
00:04:19,115 --> 00:04:20,315
"Someone like Donna"?

57
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:22,217
I just mean that she knows me.

58
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:24,019
I've been with that family
for four years.

59
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:26,154
I've seen those kids grow up.
Patricia trusts me.

60
00:04:26,156 --> 00:04:27,856
She knows that I'm a mom, too.

61
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:29,293
The job is to do
what's best for the kids.

62
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:31,825
Okay, okay, look.
Just keep the case.

63
00:04:31,827 --> 00:04:33,861
Once you get done here,
check in with patrol.

64
00:04:33,863 --> 00:04:36,296
I don't need patrol.
Take an officer.

65
00:04:36,298 --> 00:04:38,168
That's not a request.

66
00:04:39,803 --> 00:04:40,935
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:40,937 --> 00:04:43,371
You know what, I can
handle this myself, okay?

68
00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:45,239
I'm sure you can.

69
00:04:52,382 --> 00:04:54,251
Hi, Patricia.

70
00:04:55,118 --> 00:04:56,153
How are you?

71
00:04:58,255 --> 00:05:00,354
Are the boys home?

72
00:05:00,356 --> 00:05:02,823
Ma'am, open the door.
No, that's okay.

73
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:04,758
Just give us a second.

74
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,195
Patricia, where are the boys?

75
00:05:07,197 --> 00:05:09,029
They're somewhere safe, Anna.

76
00:05:09,031 --> 00:05:10,864
Oh.

77
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:12,433
Look, I don't know
what's going on,

78
00:05:12,435 --> 00:05:14,301
but I might be your best bet
at clearing things up.

79
00:05:14,303 --> 00:05:16,003
So why don't you let me in

80
00:05:16,005 --> 00:05:19,275
and you can show me that
they're safe, like you said?

81
00:05:21,945 --> 00:05:24,746
No, he doesn't even
have to come inside.

82
00:05:24,748 --> 00:05:27,351
Okay? Why don't you
just let me in?

83
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:31,820
Uh-uh. Promised her
that I'd go in alone.

84
00:05:31,822 --> 00:05:34,289
Yeah, out of respect
for Officer Garcia.

85
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,056
Your husband
was a police officer.

86
00:05:36,058 --> 00:05:38,294
You think he'd let you
go in there alone?

87
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:40,330
Yeah, I do.

88
00:05:42,164 --> 00:05:43,964
I'll be right here.

89
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:44,969
Thank you.

90
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:55,279
Patricia,
what happened in here?

91
00:05:57,848 --> 00:05:59,216
Where are the boys?

92
00:06:03,486 --> 00:06:05,486
If you're drinking again or
if you're having some kinda...

93
00:06:10,324 --> 00:06:11,061
Listen.

94
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,799
What?

95
00:06:18,334 --> 00:06:20,270
What do you hear?

96
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,775
Her crying.

97
00:07:40,851 --> 00:07:42,386
Carlos?

98
00:07:47,923 --> 00:07:49,425
Tomas?

99
00:07:55,966 --> 00:07:57,265
Get away from that door, Anna.

100
00:07:57,267 --> 00:07:59,067
Patricia...
Get out, Anna.

101
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:00,068
What do you have inside here?

102
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,270
Patricia, please. I just...

103
00:08:02,272 --> 00:08:04,137
Get out!

104
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:05,440
Please, just tell me
what's in here.

105
00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:07,075
Get out!

106
00:08:07,077 --> 00:08:10,077
Stay away from that door!

107
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,212
Anna! Anna! Anna!
I told you! Get out!

108
00:08:12,214 --> 00:08:13,380
Jesus Christ!

109
00:08:13,382 --> 00:08:15,215
Get off of her!
Now!

110
00:08:15,217 --> 00:08:16,484
Don't open the door!

111
00:08:16,486 --> 00:08:18,952
Calm down! Stop!
Just one more night, Anna!

112
00:08:18,954 --> 00:08:20,221
I said calm down!

113
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,022
Just one more night!

114
00:08:22,024 --> 00:08:23,924
Let go of me!

115
00:08:23,926 --> 00:08:25,094
You don't understand!

116
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,272
Oh, my God!

117
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:14,375
Close the door, please.

118
00:09:14,377 --> 00:09:16,213
She'll hurt us.

119
00:09:17,513 --> 00:09:20,183
No, she won't.

120
00:09:21,318 --> 00:09:23,384
I promise.

121
00:09:28,724 --> 00:09:31,058
Guys,
everything's all settled.

122
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,660
You're gonna have warm beds,

123
00:09:33,662 --> 00:09:36,197
and hot food,

124
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:37,668
and a shower.

125
00:09:38,334 --> 00:09:39,670
Okay?

126
00:09:50,347 --> 00:09:51,682
My gosh!

127
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:55,252
How did that happen?

128
00:09:56,987 --> 00:09:58,689
She did it.

129
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:03,423
Your mother did that to you?

130
00:10:03,425 --> 00:10:04,491
No.

131
00:10:04,493 --> 00:10:06,095
It wasn't her.

132
00:10:13,268 --> 00:10:16,371
Your mother loves you.
You know that, right?

133
00:10:16,373 --> 00:10:17,505
Whatever's happening,

134
00:10:17,507 --> 00:10:19,310
we're gonna
take care of it, okay?

135
00:10:20,776 --> 00:10:22,979
But for tonight,
you guys are safe.

136
00:10:24,446 --> 00:10:25,982
I promise you.

137
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:30,454
We're not safe anywhere.

138
00:10:40,363 --> 00:10:41,464
Hi!

139
00:10:42,198 --> 00:10:43,968
Sorry I'm late.

140
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:46,366
How was school?

141
00:10:46,368 --> 00:10:48,236
Same old, same old.

142
00:10:48,238 --> 00:10:49,739
Hey, Sam.

143
00:10:50,406 --> 00:10:51,672
Hey.

144
00:10:51,674 --> 00:10:53,140
There was meatloaf
in the fridge.

145
00:10:53,142 --> 00:10:54,274
Did Chris warm it up for you?

146
00:10:54,276 --> 00:10:55,713
I don't know.

147
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:57,680
Hello?

148
00:10:58,415 --> 00:11:00,148
Yeah, he heated it up.

149
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,481
Okay. Where is he?

150
00:11:01,483 --> 00:11:04,187
He's playing in Dad's office.

151
00:11:05,789 --> 00:11:08,222
Not too much TV, okay?

152
00:11:08,224 --> 00:11:10,191
We've got
a 10-15 in Midtown.

153
00:11:10,193 --> 00:11:12,726
Suspect is on the run.

154
00:11:12,728 --> 00:11:14,327
I'm pursuing on foot.

155
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:15,563
I think I see something.

156
00:11:15,565 --> 00:11:16,697
There he is.

157
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:19,567
I'm on his tail.
I see the suspect.

158
00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:21,202
I need backup.

159
00:11:21,204 --> 00:11:22,437
Bam, bam!

160
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:25,509
I need backup.
I'm taking fire!

161
00:11:26,575 --> 00:11:27,741
Freeze!

162
00:11:27,743 --> 00:11:30,244
Bam, bam, bam!
I got him.

163
00:11:30,246 --> 00:11:32,145
I got the suspect.

164
00:11:32,147 --> 00:11:34,550
Call it in, Coop.
We got him.

165
00:12:02,845 --> 00:12:05,481
Mom, I'm all done!

166
00:12:07,883 --> 00:12:10,153
I'm coming!

167
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,326
Right. Let's see.

168
00:12:20,796 --> 00:12:22,065
Okay.

169
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:24,167
Rinsing.

170
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,135
Rinsing.

171
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:43,279
Tomas. Tomas.

172
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:01,331
Tomas.

173
00:14:12,474 --> 00:14:14,277
Tomas.

174
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,300
Tomas, what are you doing?

175
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,937
Tomas, come back.

176
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:23,247
Carlos.

177
00:15:35,391 --> 00:15:36,457
Hello?

178
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:40,093
Anna, it's Coop.

179
00:15:40,095 --> 00:15:42,630
We just pulled the
Alvarez boys out of the river.

180
00:15:42,632 --> 00:15:45,368
I'm gonna need you to meet me
at Fourth and Mission.

181
00:15:46,502 --> 00:15:48,372
Okay, I'll be right there.

182
00:16:13,896 --> 00:16:15,763
Stay in the car. Okay?

183
00:16:15,765 --> 00:16:17,832
And please
don't wake up your sister.

184
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:19,502
I'll be back in a few minutes.

185
00:16:30,847 --> 00:16:31,912
I'll keep
checking on this one.

186
00:16:31,914 --> 00:16:33,114
This way, ma'am.

187
00:16:33,116 --> 00:16:34,318
All right.

188
00:16:43,425 --> 00:16:44,627
Oh, my God!

189
00:16:46,128 --> 00:16:48,095
I don't understand.
What happened?

190
00:16:48,097 --> 00:16:51,064
We found them in the river.
They were drowned.

191
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:52,466
When you saw them,
how were they?

192
00:16:52,468 --> 00:16:53,701
They were fine.

193
00:16:53,703 --> 00:16:56,837
They were scared,
but they were fine, Coop!

194
00:16:56,839 --> 00:16:59,106
I promised them
that they would be safe, Coop.

195
00:16:59,108 --> 00:17:01,678
I promised them.
Anna, don't blame yourself.

196
00:17:04,514 --> 00:17:05,813
Mis hijos! Mis hijos!

197
00:17:05,815 --> 00:17:07,049
Hey! Hold her.

198
00:17:13,422 --> 00:17:14,724
It's your fault!

199
00:17:16,691 --> 00:17:18,592
I tried to stop her!

200
00:17:20,763 --> 00:17:21,932
Who?

201
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:25,501
Who did you try to stop?

202
00:17:26,568 --> 00:17:27,970
La Llorona.

203
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:39,536
Nino...

204
00:19:42,337 --> 00:19:44,607
Mijito...

205
00:19:45,674 --> 00:19:47,142
Mijo...

206
00:20:04,026 --> 00:20:05,695
Nino!

207
00:20:09,864 --> 00:20:13,167
Sam! Sam, let me in!

208
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:15,872
Open the door! Hurry!
Chris? What are you...

209
00:20:16,138 --> 00:20:17,771
Open!

210
00:20:32,888 --> 00:20:34,220
What's going on?

211
00:20:34,222 --> 00:20:35,691
Didn't you see her?

212
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:37,093
Who?

213
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,619
Chris, what's going on?

214
00:21:08,923 --> 00:21:09,959
Chris?

215
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:45,395
Hey, sorry, guys.

216
00:21:49,297 --> 00:21:50,299
Are you okay?

217
00:21:55,837 --> 00:21:57,204
Yeah.

218
00:21:57,206 --> 00:21:59,209
Yeah, I'm fine.

219
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:02,344
I'm fine.

220
00:22:11,453 --> 00:22:13,821
You okay, honey?

221
00:22:13,823 --> 00:22:16,726
Yeah. I was just
imagining things.

222
00:22:18,326 --> 00:22:19,328
Okay.

223
00:22:19,894 --> 00:22:20,963
Night.

224
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:24,867
Love you.

225
00:23:11,313 --> 00:23:13,346
He's a curandero.

226
00:23:13,348 --> 00:23:16,015
The ritual is called smudging.

227
00:23:16,017 --> 00:23:18,284
It's supposed to rid the body
of any negativity

228
00:23:18,286 --> 00:23:20,053
that may have
attached itself to it

229
00:23:20,055 --> 00:23:22,221
during times of great stress.

230
00:23:22,223 --> 00:23:23,990
Do you believe it works?

231
00:23:26,094 --> 00:23:28,861
What does it matter
what I believe?

232
00:23:28,863 --> 00:23:30,799
It's what they believe.

233
00:23:31,534 --> 00:23:33,033
And if they believe in that,

234
00:23:33,035 --> 00:23:36,439
then surely
they believe in this.

235
00:23:39,007 --> 00:23:40,509
Did you know the boys?

236
00:23:41,876 --> 00:23:44,980
Yeah. I was their case worker.

237
00:23:50,518 --> 00:23:52,285
Can I ask you
a question, Father?

238
00:23:52,287 --> 00:23:53,887
Yes.

239
00:23:53,889 --> 00:23:56,523
Do you know anything
about La Llorona?

240
00:24:00,161 --> 00:24:02,966
I haven't heard that name
since I was a child.

241
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:08,101
The Weeping Woman.

242
00:24:08,103 --> 00:24:10,105
She was known for her beauty.

243
00:24:11,907 --> 00:24:15,876
The most beautiful woman
in that part of Mexico.

244
00:24:15,878 --> 00:24:18,978
Then one day,
a rich and handsome ranchero

245
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,980
rode into her village.

246
00:24:20,982 --> 00:24:23,851
She set her sights on him.

247
00:24:23,853 --> 00:24:26,018
The marriage was splendid.

248
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,389
They had two beautiful
children whom they treasured.

249
00:24:29,391 --> 00:24:33,427
But then, after a time,

250
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:36,533
she discovered him in the arms
of a younger woman.

251
00:24:38,566 --> 00:24:40,434
What'd she do?

252
00:24:40,436 --> 00:24:43,540
She took from him
what was most priceless.

253
00:24:45,274 --> 00:24:47,043
She murdered their children.

254
00:24:49,245 --> 00:24:53,346
In a fit of jealous rage,
she drowned them in the river.

255
00:24:53,348 --> 00:24:55,983
After she realized
what she had done,

256
00:24:55,985 --> 00:24:58,651
she was consumed by guilt.

257
00:24:58,653 --> 00:25:01,420
She threw herself
into those same waters.

258
00:25:01,422 --> 00:25:04,056
Then is cursed
to roam the earth,

259
00:25:04,058 --> 00:25:06,595
searching for children
to take their place.

260
00:25:08,197 --> 00:25:10,300
Children are told to behave,

261
00:25:11,366 --> 00:25:14,034
listen to their elders,

262
00:25:14,036 --> 00:25:17,974
or La Llorona will come
and steal them away.

263
00:25:20,174 --> 00:25:21,877
So it's a folktale?

264
00:25:25,447 --> 00:25:26,916
To some.

265
00:25:31,386 --> 00:25:32,554
Here.

266
00:25:33,956 --> 00:25:37,024
It has seen me through
many dark nights.

267
00:25:37,026 --> 00:25:38,492
May it do the same for you.

268
00:25:38,494 --> 00:25:43,199
Oh, thank you but my husband
was the religious one, not me.

269
00:25:44,365 --> 00:25:46,368
You don't
have to be religious

270
00:25:47,135 --> 00:25:48,971
to have faith.

271
00:28:20,189 --> 00:28:21,423
Chris?

272
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,395
Chris!

273
00:28:29,198 --> 00:28:30,233
Sam?

274
00:28:32,133 --> 00:28:33,135
Sam?

275
00:28:40,609 --> 00:28:41,711
Sam?

276
00:28:58,727 --> 00:29:00,095
Sam?

277
00:29:20,582 --> 00:29:21,584
Sam?

278
00:29:22,784 --> 00:29:24,487
What's going on, honey?

279
00:29:25,453 --> 00:29:27,089
Honey, what happened
to your arm?

280
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,725
I fell.

281
00:29:31,392 --> 00:29:32,862
That's quite a fall.

282
00:29:35,463 --> 00:29:36,465
Hey.

283
00:29:37,499 --> 00:29:41,234
I know things are a little bit
hard right now.

284
00:29:41,236 --> 00:29:43,706
And I know that the world
sometimes seems scary.

285
00:29:45,873 --> 00:29:47,707
But I was thinking,

286
00:29:47,709 --> 00:29:50,744
remember what
Daddy used to say?

287
00:29:50,746 --> 00:29:53,583
About if you were scared
and he wasn't there?

288
00:29:54,716 --> 00:29:56,649
He'd tell you
to hold onto to Misty

289
00:29:56,651 --> 00:29:58,621
and you squeeze her
really tight.

290
00:29:59,688 --> 00:30:01,755
Does it feel any better?

291
00:30:01,757 --> 00:30:03,758
That feels
a little bit better, right?

292
00:30:08,197 --> 00:30:09,398
What are you looking at?

293
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:15,204
Coop's here.

294
00:30:24,313 --> 00:30:25,648
Come on.

295
00:30:28,316 --> 00:30:29,651
Come on, sweetie.

296
00:30:46,235 --> 00:30:47,737
Rough day, guys?

297
00:30:50,305 --> 00:30:51,673
Can we go watch TV?

298
00:30:53,275 --> 00:30:54,410
Sure.

299
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,653
Um...

300
00:31:07,655 --> 00:31:08,823
Cheers?

301
00:31:11,293 --> 00:31:12,792
It's been that kinda day, huh?

302
00:31:12,794 --> 00:31:14,761
Week.
Month?

303
00:31:14,763 --> 00:31:17,697
Year.

304
00:31:17,699 --> 00:31:19,466
I don't know.
They're hanging in.

305
00:31:19,468 --> 00:31:21,737
I think we need...

306
00:31:23,337 --> 00:31:24,603
Time.

307
00:31:24,605 --> 00:31:25,807
Yeah.

308
00:31:26,674 --> 00:31:27,976
And the occasional takeout,

309
00:31:28,844 --> 00:31:30,276
so thank you.

310
00:31:30,278 --> 00:31:32,445
You're welcome.

311
00:31:32,447 --> 00:31:33,513
Well, if you're not
in the mood

312
00:31:33,515 --> 00:31:34,581
to talk personal problems,

313
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:36,518
how about professional ones?

314
00:31:36,951 --> 00:31:38,517
Oh, no. What?

315
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:40,690
It's about Patricia Alvarez.

316
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:43,990
We know that she had
some involvement

317
00:31:43,992 --> 00:31:46,793
in her sons' deaths,
but she has a solid alibi.

318
00:31:46,795 --> 00:31:48,328
Several parishioners
at her church say

319
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,063
they saw her at the time
that her kids were taken.

320
00:31:50,065 --> 00:31:51,163
Really?

321
00:31:51,165 --> 00:31:54,668
You know her story.
Just take a look at the file.

322
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,471
Maybe you'll see
something I missed.

323
00:31:57,939 --> 00:31:59,572
I would love to help you

324
00:31:59,574 --> 00:32:02,508
but she does not
want to see me.

325
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,476
Well, that's just it.

326
00:32:04,478 --> 00:32:05,480
She's angry at you.

327
00:32:06,948 --> 00:32:07,813
And one of the first things

328
00:32:07,815 --> 00:32:09,448
your husband
ever taught me is that...

329
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,386
Angry people love to talk.

330
00:33:58,759 --> 00:33:59,929
She did it.

331
00:37:06,681 --> 00:37:07,850
Chris.

332
00:37:11,018 --> 00:37:12,787
What are you doing?

333
00:37:15,122 --> 00:37:16,124
Chris.

334
00:37:17,658 --> 00:37:18,861
Hey.

335
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,895
You okay, honey?

336
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:23,332
Chris?

337
00:37:24,064 --> 00:37:25,833
Honey?

338
00:37:26,835 --> 00:37:28,070
You all right?

339
00:37:29,103 --> 00:37:30,902
You okay, honey?

340
00:37:30,904 --> 00:37:32,274
Chris?

341
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:52,761
Chris?

342
00:37:53,127 --> 00:37:55,395
Honey. Hey.

343
00:37:55,397 --> 00:37:57,096
Come on.

344
00:37:57,098 --> 00:37:58,431
Hey, wake up.

345
00:37:58,433 --> 00:37:59,931
What happened?

346
00:37:59,933 --> 00:38:01,234
You were sleepwalking, baby.

347
00:38:01,236 --> 00:38:02,902
Oh, sweetie.

348
00:38:02,904 --> 00:38:05,038
You were just sleepwalking.

349
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,406
It's okay.

350
00:38:06,408 --> 00:38:07,873
Come on. Come on, baby.

351
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:09,178
Let's get you upstairs.
Let's go to sleep.

352
00:38:10,011 --> 00:38:11,411
Come on.

353
00:38:11,413 --> 00:38:13,082
You're okay.

354
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,767
Is there someone in here?

355
00:39:14,274 --> 00:39:15,908
Because my husband is a cop

356
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:18,413
and he's gonna be home
any minute now.

357
00:39:56,417 --> 00:39:58,049
Sam! Chris!

358
00:39:58,051 --> 00:39:59,919
Kids, wake up!
Open the door!

359
00:39:59,921 --> 00:40:01,723
Open the door!

360
00:40:11,064 --> 00:40:13,900
What are you doing
in my house?

361
00:40:15,937 --> 00:40:18,040
What are you doing
in my house?

362
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,542
Get out of my house!

363
00:40:22,544 --> 00:40:25,844
Mom?

364
00:40:25,846 --> 00:40:27,045
What happened?

365
00:40:32,152 --> 00:40:34,020
Nothing. Nothing.

366
00:40:34,022 --> 00:40:35,487
Nothing, honey. Nothing.

367
00:40:35,489 --> 00:40:38,026
I'm sorry.
Come on in, honey.

368
00:40:39,993 --> 00:40:41,092
Go on, go on.

369
00:40:41,094 --> 00:40:43,995
Why don't you sleep
in Mommy's bed tonight, okay?

370
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,322
Chris,
get your foot off of me.

371
00:41:16,297 --> 00:41:17,499
What?

372
00:41:36,651 --> 00:41:38,520
Patricia?

373
00:41:43,091 --> 00:41:46,862
I'm very sorry
about your loss.

374
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:51,933
I can't even imagine
how you must feel.

375
00:41:55,969 --> 00:41:57,569
How I feel?

376
00:42:00,408 --> 00:42:02,310
I feel nothing.

377
00:42:03,243 --> 00:42:05,413
Because I have felt the worst.

378
00:42:07,348 --> 00:42:09,147
I am done.

379
00:42:09,149 --> 00:42:11,252
I don't care
what they do to me.

380
00:42:13,553 --> 00:42:15,623
You should be sitting here
instead of me.

381
00:42:16,491 --> 00:42:19,458
You killed my boys, not me.

382
00:42:21,962 --> 00:42:23,596
Patricia,
you had them locked up.

383
00:42:23,598 --> 00:42:25,163
I had them hidden.

384
00:42:27,634 --> 00:42:29,567
And now she has them!

385
00:42:29,569 --> 00:42:31,172
She has them!

386
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,375
Mis hijos.

387
00:42:40,247 --> 00:42:42,714
What happened to your arm?

388
00:42:42,716 --> 00:42:44,585
What happened to you,
Patricia?

389
00:42:48,589 --> 00:42:50,392
La Llorona.

390
00:42:52,393 --> 00:42:54,029
Your children,

391
00:42:55,562 --> 00:42:57,131
have they heard her crying?

392
00:42:58,533 --> 00:43:01,670
Have they felt
the sting of her tears?

393
00:43:03,538 --> 00:43:05,607
They will. Soon.

394
00:43:06,707 --> 00:43:09,141
And she will come for them.

395
00:43:09,143 --> 00:43:10,145
You know why?

396
00:43:12,379 --> 00:43:14,348
Because I told her to.

397
00:43:14,982 --> 00:43:16,449
No, Patricia...

398
00:43:16,451 --> 00:43:19,217
You know, when my boys died,

399
00:43:19,219 --> 00:43:22,754
I didn't pray to God
for their salvation.

400
00:43:22,756 --> 00:43:26,294
Instead, I prayed to her.

401
00:43:28,129 --> 00:43:30,228
I prayed,

402
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:32,665
and I prayed,
and I prayed to her

403
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:34,266
to give my children
back to me

404
00:43:34,268 --> 00:43:36,238
and take yours instead.

405
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:51,178
Sam?

406
00:45:04,558 --> 00:45:05,794
Sam?

407
00:45:28,448 --> 00:45:29,683
Sam?

408
00:46:04,886 --> 00:46:06,254
Chris!

409
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:10,623
What?

410
00:46:12,192 --> 00:46:13,428
Chris!

411
00:46:13,694 --> 00:46:15,828
Chris!

412
00:46:17,531 --> 00:46:19,600
Ah.

413
00:46:20,567 --> 00:46:23,104
Sprained this pretty bad,
champ.

414
00:47:05,312 --> 00:47:06,814
Cooper, hi.

415
00:47:09,783 --> 00:47:11,283
What?

416
00:47:11,285 --> 00:47:12,717
The hospital called?

417
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:13,886
Yeah.

418
00:47:13,888 --> 00:47:15,556
Welfare check.

419
00:47:28,301 --> 00:47:31,338
Samantha,
how did you get those burns?

420
00:47:39,647 --> 00:47:41,480
How about you, Chris?

421
00:47:41,482 --> 00:47:43,652
I told you, I fell.

422
00:47:44,518 --> 00:47:46,351
Is that true?

423
00:47:46,353 --> 00:47:47,689
Where was your mom?

424
00:47:52,359 --> 00:47:54,692
Anna, you know
you can't be here.

425
00:47:54,694 --> 00:47:56,328
Oh, come on, Donna.
I wouldn't...

426
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:57,395
They're trying to protect you.

427
00:47:57,397 --> 00:47:58,931
They're telling you the truth.

428
00:47:58,933 --> 00:48:01,533
I would never hurt my kids.

429
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,335
She's right.

430
00:48:03,337 --> 00:48:04,739
You can't be here.

431
00:48:20,453 --> 00:48:24,426
You may not believe this,
but I hate having to be here.

432
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:32,531
I promised your dad
I'd watch out for you guys.

433
00:48:32,533 --> 00:48:33,598
So if you ever need anything,

434
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,936
just call me. Got it?

435
00:48:39,372 --> 00:48:42,007
We had to release
Patricia Alvarez.

436
00:48:42,009 --> 00:48:43,445
Didn't have enough
to charge her.

437
00:48:46,346 --> 00:48:48,249
Maybe she didn't do it.

438
00:48:49,317 --> 00:48:50,452
What do you mean?

439
00:48:55,056 --> 00:48:57,459
I don't know. Never mind.

440
00:48:58,359 --> 00:48:59,725
Anna,

441
00:48:59,727 --> 00:49:01,462
whatever's going on here,

442
00:49:01,995 --> 00:49:03,430
fix it.

443
00:49:13,741 --> 00:49:17,810
Dad, for the first time
in my life, I'm in love.

444
00:49:17,812 --> 00:49:18,976
That's very serious.

445
00:49:18,978 --> 00:49:20,112
Hey.

446
00:49:20,114 --> 00:49:21,349
And she loves me, Dad.

447
00:49:25,986 --> 00:49:27,355
Chris...

448
00:49:30,056 --> 00:49:31,593
Can we talk?

449
00:49:35,895 --> 00:49:37,832
Honey, I need to know
what really happened.

450
00:50:11,899 --> 00:50:13,498
I saw a woman.

451
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,703
In the house?

452
00:50:17,571 --> 00:50:18,906
In Samantha's room.

453
00:50:20,174 --> 00:50:22,911
I thought it was Sam but...

454
00:50:25,946 --> 00:50:28,083
A woman in a white dress.

455
00:50:29,417 --> 00:50:30,685
She was crying.

456
00:50:31,585 --> 00:50:33,455
She wants us.

457
00:50:35,689 --> 00:50:37,558
She wants us to be hers.

458
00:50:41,529 --> 00:50:43,531
Ow. Mom, that hurts.

459
00:50:46,901 --> 00:50:48,103
Rinsing.

460
00:50:54,507 --> 00:50:55,944
You believe me?

461
00:50:57,944 --> 00:50:59,046
Yes.

462
00:50:59,647 --> 00:51:00,882
I do.

463
00:51:36,517 --> 00:51:37,652
Sam?

464
00:51:43,056 --> 00:51:44,058
Sam?

465
00:51:49,529 --> 00:51:51,865
Sam! Sam!

466
00:51:52,665 --> 00:51:54,067
Sam! Open the door! Sam!

467
00:51:55,102 --> 00:51:56,103
Sam!

468
00:52:09,817 --> 00:52:12,120
What happened?
What happened to you?

469
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:13,851
Honey.

470
00:52:13,853 --> 00:52:15,622
You okay?
What happened?

471
00:52:18,158 --> 00:52:19,160
Sam?

472
00:52:26,232 --> 00:52:27,533
Sam?

473
00:52:27,535 --> 00:52:28,569
Mom.

474
00:52:29,136 --> 00:52:30,705
Mom. Mom!

475
00:52:31,171 --> 00:52:32,703
Mom!

476
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:38,243
Go!

477
00:52:40,013 --> 00:52:41,915
Go! Run!

478
00:52:42,815 --> 00:52:43,982
Go!

479
00:52:43,984 --> 00:52:45,049
Run!

480
00:52:55,895 --> 00:52:57,129
Run!

481
00:52:57,131 --> 00:52:58,266
Go!

482
00:52:58,799 --> 00:52:59,801
Run!

483
00:53:22,723 --> 00:53:25,058
I know it sounds
hard to believe.

484
00:53:29,129 --> 00:53:30,629
A few years ago,

485
00:53:30,631 --> 00:53:34,766
I placed little stock
in legends, myths,

486
00:53:34,768 --> 00:53:36,971
things that go
bump in the night.

487
00:53:38,004 --> 00:53:39,172
But then

488
00:53:40,006 --> 00:53:41,842
there was an incident

489
00:53:43,611 --> 00:53:44,946
with a doll.

490
00:53:50,984 --> 00:53:52,317
It opened my mind

491
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,589
to possibilities
out of the ordinary.

492
00:53:55,788 --> 00:53:57,057
Can you help us?

493
00:53:59,859 --> 00:54:01,792
The Church works with people

494
00:54:01,794 --> 00:54:04,629
who specialize
in situations like this.

495
00:54:04,631 --> 00:54:05,897
Okay.

496
00:54:05,899 --> 00:54:09,836
But to get to them, we'd have
to go through the archdiocese.

497
00:54:11,337 --> 00:54:13,638
How long does that take?

498
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:17,344
At its best, several weeks
for a case to be approved.

499
00:54:22,315 --> 00:54:23,317
No.

500
00:54:25,285 --> 00:54:27,419
There may be another way.

501
00:54:27,421 --> 00:54:30,792
It's unorthodox,
but he's local.

502
00:54:31,859 --> 00:54:34,094
However,
if you choose this route,

503
00:54:35,428 --> 00:54:37,362
I must obey
the laws of the Church,

504
00:54:37,364 --> 00:54:40,431
and remove myself
from this process.

505
00:54:40,433 --> 00:54:44,069
As I said,
his methods are unorthodox.

506
00:54:44,071 --> 00:54:46,237
And the Church, well,

507
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:49,373
the Church has their ways,
and he has his.

508
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:52,714
It's why he abandoned
the collar years ago.

509
00:54:53,446 --> 00:54:54,913
He used to be a priest.

510
00:54:54,915 --> 00:54:55,917
Yes.

511
00:54:58,252 --> 00:55:00,951
But now, he's a faith healer.

512
00:55:00,953 --> 00:55:02,853
A shaman who operates

513
00:55:02,855 --> 00:55:05,727
on the fringes
of religion and science.

514
00:55:07,995 --> 00:55:10,395
A curandero.

515
00:55:19,172 --> 00:55:21,042
Don't touch anything, okay?

516
00:55:23,176 --> 00:55:24,875
Hola. Excuse me.

517
00:55:24,877 --> 00:55:26,713
Um...
I've seen you before.

518
00:55:28,815 --> 00:55:30,449
The Alvarez memorial.

519
00:55:30,451 --> 00:55:31,719
Yes?

520
00:55:32,453 --> 00:55:34,819
Yes. I was her case worker.

521
00:55:34,821 --> 00:55:37,321
Well, if you've come just to
gawk at my shop,

522
00:55:37,323 --> 00:55:40,127
I have more
important things to do.

523
00:55:41,261 --> 00:55:42,426
You know what,
I don't think that

524
00:55:42,428 --> 00:55:43,795
we're in the right spot.
I'm sorry.

525
00:55:43,797 --> 00:55:45,132
Come on, guys.

526
00:55:51,437 --> 00:55:52,439
Have you seen this before?

527
00:55:53,439 --> 00:55:54,505
Yes.

528
00:55:54,507 --> 00:55:55,743
What is it?

529
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:57,942
The Church can help you.

530
00:55:57,944 --> 00:56:00,981
No, no, no, please. The Church
sent us here, to you.

531
00:56:01,848 --> 00:56:05,385
This is Church business.

532
00:56:07,386 --> 00:56:08,922
Please.

533
00:56:19,265 --> 00:56:23,335
These are the marks
of La Llorona.

534
00:56:23,337 --> 00:56:25,273
You have seen her then?

535
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:30,942
You ever seen her?

536
00:56:30,944 --> 00:56:31,946
No.

537
00:56:33,446 --> 00:56:34,981
Not directly.

538
00:56:35,982 --> 00:56:37,984
But I have seen what she does.

539
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,486
What do we do?

540
00:56:41,488 --> 00:56:45,192
We are facing an evil
that has no bounds.

541
00:56:47,861 --> 00:56:51,429
But she's not human. Right?

542
00:56:51,431 --> 00:56:54,435
No. But she was,

543
00:56:56,169 --> 00:57:00,340
until her murderous vanity
consumed her.

544
00:57:01,308 --> 00:57:04,241
She's just a dark spirit.

545
00:57:04,243 --> 00:57:06,310
Unholy. Forsaken by God.

546
00:57:06,312 --> 00:57:08,279
Okay, that's it. I'm gonna
take them to a motel.

547
00:57:08,281 --> 00:57:09,415
Why?

548
00:57:09,417 --> 00:57:14,252
She's attached herself to
your family, not your house.

549
00:57:14,254 --> 00:57:17,225
If you move,
she will follow you.

550
00:57:19,125 --> 00:57:20,928
What are we supposed
to do then?

551
00:57:28,835 --> 00:57:31,169
I don't think
that's gonna help.

552
00:57:31,171 --> 00:57:34,174
No. Not just this.

553
00:57:38,245 --> 00:57:39,046
At the memorial,

554
00:57:41,147 --> 00:57:44,415
I saw you speaking
with Father Perez.

555
00:57:44,417 --> 00:57:46,419
He said that
you used to be a priest.

556
00:57:49,288 --> 00:57:51,424
My journey
began in the Church.

557
00:57:53,292 --> 00:57:54,461
Yes.

558
00:57:57,263 --> 00:57:58,999
That was a long time ago.

559
00:58:03,437 --> 00:58:06,274
Take me to your home.
We must begin immediately.

560
00:58:13,446 --> 00:58:14,712
We're done.

561
00:58:14,714 --> 00:58:18,016
I'm sorry, are you just gonna
rub eggs all over everything?

562
00:58:18,018 --> 00:58:20,221
You think it's silly,
don't you?

563
00:58:20,953 --> 00:58:22,355
Pretty much.

564
00:58:25,091 --> 00:58:26,259
Come with me.

565
00:58:28,261 --> 00:58:31,228
This ritual, la limpia,

566
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:33,567
is used to detect
the presence of evil.

567
00:58:38,205 --> 00:58:40,004
The bloodier the content,

568
00:58:40,006 --> 00:58:42,108
the greater the evil.

569
00:59:14,341 --> 00:59:17,344
Oh, that's a trick.
I saw it on Johnny Carson.

570
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:21,982
Mom.

571
00:59:36,228 --> 00:59:37,265
Ta-da.

572
00:59:38,531 --> 00:59:40,300
Did you see that on Carson?

573
00:59:41,701 --> 00:59:42,904
No.

574
00:59:50,176 --> 00:59:51,178
Amen.

575
00:59:56,015 --> 00:59:58,984
We all need to work together.

576
00:59:58,986 --> 01:00:01,522
La Llorona
thrives in darkness.

577
01:00:02,189 --> 01:00:03,524
Let's prepare.

578
01:00:25,712 --> 01:00:30,181
That cross was carved
from a tree in Mexico.

579
01:00:30,183 --> 01:00:32,116
It blooms with red blossoms

580
01:00:32,118 --> 01:00:34,719
that make it look like
it's on fire.

581
01:00:39,058 --> 01:00:40,424
The fire tree.

582
01:00:40,426 --> 01:00:41,962
They say

583
01:00:42,495 --> 01:00:44,029
the fire trees wept

584
01:00:44,031 --> 01:00:46,730
as La Llorona
drowned her children.

585
01:00:46,732 --> 01:00:49,567
As the only witness
to her sins,

586
01:00:49,569 --> 01:00:52,373
they hold a special power
over her.

587
01:01:10,689 --> 01:01:14,591
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti.

588
01:01:14,593 --> 01:01:15,662
Amen.

589
01:01:27,607 --> 01:01:29,110
What is that?

590
01:01:29,843 --> 01:01:32,076
The tears of La Llorona.

591
01:01:32,078 --> 01:01:33,279
I've sanctified them.

592
01:01:33,647 --> 01:01:34,648
Why?

593
01:01:35,815 --> 01:01:37,417
Antivenom.

594
01:02:01,674 --> 01:02:03,440
Is that another ritual?

595
01:02:03,442 --> 01:02:06,147
Yes. Breakfast for dinner.

596
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:09,547
That was David's thing.

597
01:02:09,549 --> 01:02:12,350
Breakfast for dinner.
I used to always tease him

598
01:02:12,352 --> 01:02:13,585
it was 'cause cereal
was the only thing

599
01:02:13,587 --> 01:02:14,520
he knew how to make.

600
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:18,589
Tonight, la comida
is for comfort,

601
01:02:18,591 --> 01:02:20,525
after everything
that you've been through,

602
01:02:20,527 --> 01:02:21,796
and what's to come.

603
01:02:22,696 --> 01:02:24,895
You don't seem very confident.

604
01:02:24,897 --> 01:02:27,732
I'm confident in God.

605
01:02:27,734 --> 01:02:30,435
Father Perez said you turned
your back on the Church.

606
01:02:30,437 --> 01:02:33,074
The Church? Yes.

607
01:02:33,772 --> 01:02:36,176
God? Never.

608
01:02:40,212 --> 01:02:41,448
Get the kids.

609
01:02:50,524 --> 01:02:52,359
Watch the flames.

610
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,359
A steady flame tells us

611
01:02:55,361 --> 01:02:57,230
that our protective charms
are working.

612
01:02:58,431 --> 01:03:00,201
Is she coming?

613
01:03:03,803 --> 01:03:05,806
She's already here.

614
01:03:31,864 --> 01:03:33,498
What is she doing?

615
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,299
She's searching.

616
01:03:35,301 --> 01:03:36,504
For what?

617
01:03:37,870 --> 01:03:39,239
Us.

618
01:05:00,819 --> 01:05:01,821
Mom!

619
01:05:02,855 --> 01:05:03,957
Mommy?

620
01:05:17,837 --> 01:05:18,839
Rafael,

621
01:05:19,973 --> 01:05:21,507
help us.

622
01:06:35,147 --> 01:06:37,482
Mis hijos.

623
01:06:41,453 --> 01:06:42,455
Mom!

624
01:06:43,022 --> 01:06:44,654
Mom, she's got me!

625
01:06:47,127 --> 01:06:48,393
Mom!

626
01:06:48,395 --> 01:06:49,659
Chris!

627
01:06:49,661 --> 01:06:50,663
Mom!

628
01:06:51,131 --> 01:06:53,498
Sam, help me!

629
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:55,433
Chris! Grab my hand!

630
01:06:56,870 --> 01:06:57,871
No!

631
01:07:42,147 --> 01:07:44,015
You told us we'd be safe!

632
01:07:44,017 --> 01:07:45,917
You said
the light would protect us!

633
01:07:45,919 --> 01:07:47,185
Not true.

634
01:07:47,187 --> 01:07:48,819
Mommy, Misty's gone!
I can't find her!

635
01:07:48,821 --> 01:07:50,520
Honey, not now.

636
01:07:50,522 --> 01:07:51,858
You let her get me.

637
01:07:53,625 --> 01:07:55,094
What are you talking about?

638
01:07:57,497 --> 01:07:58,929
You used my son as bait?

639
01:07:58,931 --> 01:08:01,165
No. Of course not.

640
01:08:01,167 --> 01:08:03,033
I used all of you as bait.

641
01:08:03,035 --> 01:08:04,601
Are you crazy?

642
01:08:04,603 --> 01:08:06,103
What if you didn't
get to him in time?

643
01:08:06,105 --> 01:08:07,103
But I did.

644
01:08:07,105 --> 01:08:09,109
And now La Llorona
is out of your house.

645
01:08:10,643 --> 01:08:11,812
What are those?

646
01:08:12,578 --> 01:08:13,946
Remember the fire tree?

647
01:08:14,747 --> 01:08:17,114
Those are its seeds.

648
01:08:17,116 --> 01:08:20,084
As long as this line
remains unbroken,

649
01:08:20,086 --> 01:08:21,651
she cannot enter.

650
01:08:21,653 --> 01:08:22,954
Do not touch them.

651
01:08:22,956 --> 01:08:24,922
La Llorona will do
whatever she can

652
01:08:24,924 --> 01:08:26,859
to get back inside this house.

653
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,539
The back door!
Chris!

654
01:08:46,144 --> 01:08:47,978
Quick!
Grab a hammer and nails!

655
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:49,646
She's gonna get in!

656
01:08:50,983 --> 01:08:52,249
Don't let her in! Don't!

657
01:08:52,251 --> 01:08:53,851
Away, spirit!

658
01:08:53,853 --> 01:08:55,820
You have no power here!

659
01:08:55,822 --> 01:08:57,989
Away from this family!

660
01:08:57,991 --> 01:08:59,723
Anna, hurry!

661
01:09:19,778 --> 01:09:21,779
Hold it steady!
Hold it!

662
01:09:21,781 --> 01:09:23,649
Just a few more nails!

663
01:10:44,162 --> 01:10:45,730
Sam!

664
01:10:45,732 --> 01:10:47,234
Get away from that door!

665
01:10:48,968 --> 01:10:51,772
Mommy, I got Misty
and I didn't break the beans.

666
01:11:02,748 --> 01:11:04,080
Sam!

667
01:11:04,082 --> 01:11:05,952
Sam! Sam!

668
01:11:06,352 --> 01:11:08,052
Sam!

669
01:11:08,054 --> 01:11:09,790
She's gonna drown her.

670
01:11:10,355 --> 01:11:12,059
Oh, God! The pool!

671
01:11:22,035 --> 01:11:23,170
Sam!

672
01:12:10,382 --> 01:12:11,385
Mom!

673
01:12:35,073 --> 01:12:36,076
Amen.

674
01:13:08,174 --> 01:13:09,341
Take her!

675
01:13:14,045 --> 01:13:15,780
Is she okay?
She's okay!

676
01:13:15,782 --> 01:13:17,951
She's breathing.
She's okay.

677
01:13:36,368 --> 01:13:37,970
What did you do?

678
01:13:39,871 --> 01:13:42,539
Your pool is now filled
with holy water.

679
01:13:42,541 --> 01:13:45,344
La Llorona had no choice
but to leave.

680
01:13:51,349 --> 01:13:52,952
Thank you, honey.

681
01:13:56,354 --> 01:13:57,424
Sweetie?

682
01:13:58,590 --> 01:14:00,089
Are you okay, honey?

683
01:14:00,091 --> 01:14:02,194
Sam. Sam.

684
01:14:02,528 --> 01:14:03,764
Sam?

685
01:14:08,533 --> 01:14:09,803
What's she doing?

686
01:14:14,607 --> 01:14:16,207
Sam.

687
01:14:16,209 --> 01:14:17,344
What's wrong with her?

688
01:14:18,211 --> 01:14:19,212
Rafael?

689
01:14:22,948 --> 01:14:24,017
What's wrong with her?

690
01:14:27,486 --> 01:14:30,119
La Llorona had your daughter
in her grasp.

691
01:14:30,121 --> 01:14:34,057
Now, when she calls to her
she will go.

692
01:14:34,059 --> 01:14:35,491
When we banish the spirit,

693
01:14:35,493 --> 01:14:36,893
her trance will be broken.

694
01:14:36,895 --> 01:14:39,032
Until then,
we have to keep them close.

695
01:14:44,970 --> 01:14:47,070
What?
What are you thinking?

696
01:14:47,072 --> 01:14:49,475
What?
What do we do?

697
01:15:07,559 --> 01:15:08,926
Do we have to?

698
01:15:08,928 --> 01:15:10,026
Yes.

699
01:15:10,028 --> 01:15:12,098
Just until sunrise.

700
01:15:13,532 --> 01:15:14,968
Okay.

701
01:15:18,203 --> 01:15:20,937
Okay, you gotta sit down. Sam.

702
01:15:20,939 --> 01:15:22,241
Sweetie.

703
01:15:28,147 --> 01:15:29,946
You are so brave.

704
01:15:29,948 --> 01:15:31,649
Your daddy would be
so proud of you.

705
01:15:31,651 --> 01:15:34,520
The way you look after
Sam and me.

706
01:15:35,987 --> 01:15:38,688
I need you to know
that it's okay to be scared.

707
01:15:38,690 --> 01:15:40,557
Everybody is, sometimes.

708
01:15:40,559 --> 01:15:41,959
I am.

709
01:15:41,961 --> 01:15:43,096
Daddy was.

710
01:15:43,696 --> 01:15:45,061
Rafael?

711
01:15:45,063 --> 01:15:46,129
No.

712
01:15:46,131 --> 01:15:47,166
He's lying.

713
01:15:48,667 --> 01:15:50,202
I love you, Mom.

714
01:15:51,336 --> 01:15:53,205
I love you too, baby.

715
01:15:59,178 --> 01:16:01,180
I love you both so much.

716
01:16:09,654 --> 01:16:12,524
It's okay, Mom. Do it.

717
01:16:37,515 --> 01:16:39,219
Where did you get that?

718
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:43,654
It's hers.

719
01:16:43,656 --> 01:16:44,722
Hers?

720
01:16:44,724 --> 01:16:46,259
It was around her neck.

721
01:16:51,596 --> 01:16:54,298
Keep it close.

722
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:56,603
We might be able to
use it against her.

723
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:21,118
Mom! Mom!

724
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,122
Chris!

725
01:18:22,688 --> 01:18:24,620
Chris!
Mom!

726
01:18:24,622 --> 01:18:25,625
Mom!

727
01:18:29,627 --> 01:18:30,697
Patricia.

728
01:18:31,863 --> 01:18:33,065
Patricia.

729
01:18:33,532 --> 01:18:34,731
Patricia, please.

730
01:18:34,733 --> 01:18:35,766
You took my babies from me!

731
01:18:35,768 --> 01:18:38,168
Don't do this.
She'll give them back to me.

732
01:18:38,170 --> 01:18:39,436
Patricia,
please don't do this!

733
01:18:39,438 --> 01:18:40,503
Patricia, please.

734
01:18:40,505 --> 01:18:42,138
Please put the gun down.

735
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:43,774
Okay? We can talk about this.

736
01:18:43,776 --> 01:18:45,142
You and I can
just talk about this.

737
01:18:45,144 --> 01:18:46,442
Okay? Patricia, please.

738
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:50,446
Please...

739
01:18:50,448 --> 01:18:51,750
Please bring them back to me.

740
01:18:52,184 --> 01:18:53,283
No.

741
01:18:53,285 --> 01:18:55,421
Give me back my boys!

742
01:18:58,623 --> 01:19:00,257
No!

743
01:19:02,862 --> 01:19:04,297
Mom!

744
01:19:05,464 --> 01:19:06,800
Run!

745
01:19:08,134 --> 01:19:09,199
Mom!

746
01:19:20,813 --> 01:19:22,248
Come on.

747
01:19:27,519 --> 01:19:28,819
It's locked.
Mine too.

748
01:19:28,821 --> 01:19:30,753
Let me check this one.

749
01:19:30,755 --> 01:19:32,556
Chris, they're all locked.

750
01:19:32,558 --> 01:19:33,725
What do we do?

751
01:19:46,938 --> 01:19:48,371
Hurry, Chris!

752
01:19:48,373 --> 01:19:49,541
Please. Oh, God.

753
01:19:50,843 --> 01:19:52,276
Come on! She's coming!

754
01:19:52,278 --> 01:19:53,776
She's coming. She's coming!
I know!

755
01:19:53,778 --> 01:19:54,878
Faster!
I got it!

756
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:55,882
Pull it!

757
01:19:57,715 --> 01:19:59,685
Go, go, go!

758
01:20:01,287 --> 01:20:02,322
Come on. Hurry.

759
01:20:03,288 --> 01:20:04,290
Grab the rope.

760
01:20:08,359 --> 01:20:09,595
She's coming.

761
01:20:15,901 --> 01:20:17,370
Help!

762
01:20:19,572 --> 01:20:20,704
Grab the light.

763
01:20:20,706 --> 01:20:21,808
Here it is.

764
01:20:52,737 --> 01:20:54,637
No.
This way.

765
01:20:56,608 --> 01:20:57,910
Follow me.
Okay, I'm coming.

766
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:00,313
No!

767
01:21:03,948 --> 01:21:05,649
Oh, no.

768
01:21:05,651 --> 01:21:07,554
No.

769
01:21:33,746 --> 01:21:35,348
Get behind me.

770
01:21:36,948 --> 01:21:38,582
Help!

771
01:21:38,584 --> 01:21:40,549
They're not your kids!

772
01:21:40,551 --> 01:21:41,718
No!

773
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:43,820
Let them go!

774
01:21:43,822 --> 01:21:44,824
No!

775
01:22:47,553 --> 01:22:49,756
Let them go!

776
01:22:57,929 --> 01:22:58,930
Go.

777
01:23:01,966 --> 01:23:04,368
Chris! Sam!

778
01:23:28,126 --> 01:23:29,293
Kids!

779
01:23:29,295 --> 01:23:32,065
Behold the cross of the Lord
and begone, wicked spirit!

780
01:23:36,934 --> 01:23:38,067
Mom!

781
01:23:38,069 --> 01:23:39,339
Mom.

782
01:23:46,144 --> 01:23:47,412
Mis hijos!

783
01:23:51,483 --> 01:23:52,652
Anna!

784
01:24:43,969 --> 01:24:45,438
Ta-da!

785
01:24:55,581 --> 01:24:56,815
Come here.

786
01:25:01,787 --> 01:25:02,955
It's okay.

787
01:25:04,956 --> 01:25:06,558
You're okay now.

788
01:25:22,174 --> 01:25:24,039
Thank you.

789
01:25:24,041 --> 01:25:26,511
I don't know
how I could ever repay you.

790
01:25:40,959 --> 01:25:43,226
You two were very brave.

791
01:25:43,228 --> 01:25:44,897
Even I was scared for a while.

792
01:25:46,564 --> 01:25:47,732
Really?

793
01:25:48,099 --> 01:25:49,100
No.

794
01:25:49,734 --> 01:25:51,101
Not really.

795
01:26:05,884 --> 01:26:07,487
Race you inside.

796
01:26:29,979 --> 01:26:34,979
