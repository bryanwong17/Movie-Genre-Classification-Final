<i>Long ago, a mythic</i>
<i>battle between good and evil</i>

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,673
<i>played out in ancient China.</i>

3
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,194
<i>The country was torn by civil war,</i>

4
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,352
<i>with many kingdoms</i>
<i>struggling for land and power.</i>

5
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:57,431
<i>But one king had a ruthless ambition</i>
<i>to make himself emperor by the sword.</i>

6
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,188
Leave me.

7
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,316
Prepare for war!

8
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,192
<i>The other rulers hired assassins</i>
<i>to kill the King</i>

9

10
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,272
Stop! I am not harmed.

11
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,869
We attack tonight!

12
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,431
<i>Kingdom by kingdom,</i>
<i>his army swept away everything in its path,</i>

13
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,195
<i>and anyone who resisted met a terrible fate.</i>

14
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,918
<i>The country was his.</i>

15
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,037
<i>He was now Emperor of All Under Heaven.</i>

16
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,191
<i>He enslaved his conquered enemies</i>
<i>and forced them to build his Great Wall.</i>

17
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,034
<i>When they were dead or useless,</i>
<i>he had them buried beneath it.</i>

18
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,119
<i>The Emperor's mystics taught him</i>
<i>mastery over the five elements,</i>

19
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,988
<i>fire, water, earth, wood and metal.</i>

20
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,310
<i>His power seemed without limit.</i>

21
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,476
<i>He was master of millions,</i>

22
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,189
<i>but like the lowliest peasant,</i>
<i>he could not stop growing old.</i>

23
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,273
I have too much to do for one lifetime.

24
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,274
<i>He needed to defeat</i>
<i>his last enemy, death itself.</i>

25
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,432
<i>One day, news came of a powerful witch</i>

26
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,910
<i>who was rumoured to know</i>
<i>the secret to eternal life.</i>

27
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,028
<i>He ordered General Ming, his oldest friend</i>
<i>and trusted ally, to find her.</i>

28
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,150
<i>The witch was named Zi Yuan,</i>

29
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,277
<i>and she was nothing</i>
<i>like the General expected.</i>

30
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,514
Your Majesty...

31
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,989
Rise up.

32
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,556
I do not possess the secret of
immortality, my Lord...

33
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,473
...but I know where to find it.

34
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,869
General...

35
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,038
No man is to touch her.

36
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,750
She is mine.

37
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,229
<i>On the western border</i>
<i>stood the Monastery of Turfan.</i>

38
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,154
<i>There was housed the greatest library</i>
<i>in the ancient world,</i>

39
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,279
<i>and Zi Yuan was sure</i>
<i>the secret to eternal life was here.</i>

40
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,031
This is a key.

<i>of the ancient world.</i>

43
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,033
<i>The Emperor's answer was here</i>
<i>along with other magic beyond imagining.</i>

44
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,597
You have served me well.

45
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,192
I will grant you anything you desire.

46
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,115
I want to spend my life with General Ming.

47
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,793
Of course.

48
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,349
Read.

<i>She cast the spell in Sanskrit,</i>

50

<i>an ancient language</i>
<i>that the Emperor did not understand.</i>

51
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,189
I feel your spell working.

52
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:18,158
I am now immortal.

53
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,233
Come, I want to show you something.

54
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,755
Become my queen and I will let him live.

Do what he says! Save yourself!

56
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,835
You will never keep your word.

57
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,389
You are right.

58
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,751
Now, join General Ming in hell.

59
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,034
What did you do to me?

60
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,036
I cursed you and your army.

61
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,519
Surround the Palace!

62
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,993
The Emperor is in trouble!

63
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,190
<i>The curse must never be lifted,</i>

64
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,592
<i>or the Emperor will rise again</i>
<i>to enslave all of mankind.</i>

65
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,310
<i>On that dark day,</i>
<i>there will be nothing and no one to save us.</i>

66
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,118
You can run, but you can't hide.

67
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,629
One o'clock.

68
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,358
OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND

69
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,910
Ten o'clock, one o'clock. Ten o'clock, one...

70
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,798
And this is something for grown men to do?

71
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,914
Come on.

72
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,833
Bite on this.

73
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,756
Evy, I'm home!

74
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,752
Mrs O'Connell is at her book reading, sir.
She'll be home for dinner.

75
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,435
Oh, right. Well, that's great,
'cause we're having fish.

76
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,238
You didn't think I'd catch anything,
did you?

77
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,754
I had the utmost confidence, sir.

78
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,356
There's a hook in your neck, sir.
Shall I fetch the wire cutters?

79
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,989

87
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,515
Mrs O'Connell, we're all dying to know,

88
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,956
is the Scarlet O'Keefe character
really based on you?

89
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,677
Honestly, I can say
she's a completely different person.

90
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,671
- Any more questions?
-  Mrs O'Connell...

91
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,117
Mrs O'Connell, is your life today
as exciting as it was before the war?

92
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,836
I wish my life were that exciting now.

93
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,273
Will there be another book
in the series?

94
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,828
Do you believe in happy endings?

95
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,791
Isn't this blissful?

96
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,632
Dinner at home.

97
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,196
- Every night.
- Every night.

98
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,629
- Here's to retirement.
- May we stay this happy forever.

99
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,514
Still no letter from Alex.
I've sent him three in the last month.

100
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,715
Yeah, well, what do you expect?

101
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,869
The only time we ever hear from that kid

102
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,076
is when he's getting kicked out of college
or he needs more money.

103
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,072
I'm sure he's just buried in his studies.

104
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,199
- So, how did your book reading go?
- Oh, fine. Thank you.

105
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,918
Until they asked me, "When will there
be another Mummy adventure?"

106
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,434
Yeah, but you did promise the publisher
a third book.

107
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,555
I know.

108
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,792
But I spend my nights staring
at a blank page, completely blocked.

109
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,829
We could skip dinner, and I could

110
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,994
attempt to inspire you upstairs.

111
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,751
Oh, that's so sweet of you, darling.

112
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,277
But I'm going to sit at that typewriter
until something exciting comes out.

113
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,832
Thank you.

114
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,438

119
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,389
Noodle soup.

Good. Wilson's back.

You're a couple days late, Professor.

123
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,033
I was beginning to think
you'd run into bandits.

124
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,031
Oh, my dear fellow,
thank you for the concern.

125
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,758
- Are you thirsty?
- Oh, yes, please.

126
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,796
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

127
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,876
You know,
when I saw you standing up there,

128
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,030
I thought I was looking at your father.

129
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,792
You really are Rick O'Connell's son.

130
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,510
Yeah, well, hopefully after today,
he'll be known as Alex O'Connell's father.

131
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,194
What a powerful face!

132
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,068
When I told my colleagues at the museum
that you had discovered the Colossus,

133
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,675
they were thrilled.

134
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,876
- Yes, however...
- I know.

135
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,951
When am I gonna get in that tomb?

136
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,996
Don't let the buggers get you down.

137
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,389
It was you that discovered
the Bembridge journal,

138
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,869
and with it, you'll discover the Emperor.

139
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,555
- I have complete faith in you, Alex.
- Thank you, Professor.

140
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,872
Thanks for believing in me.

141
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,912

<i>Malignant Mummy.</i>

148

Prepare to die!

149
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,873
Take that!

150
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,188
Rick!

151
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,837
Darling, where are you?

152
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,190
I'm ready to be inspired.

153
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,514
Do you remember the time
the mummy had me tied down?

154
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,388
And you came to save me and you cut...

155
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,553
No! You tore open the ropes
is what you did,

156
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,359
just as he was about to plunge his...

157
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,239
Oh, rats.

158
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,199
Watch out!

159
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,269
- Emperor didn't want any houseguests.
- Yeah.

160
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,469
Stay together.

161
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,717
Sir Colin Bembridge.

162
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,879
Oh, gee...

163
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,955
He went searching for this tomb
70 years ago.

164
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,917
They left him like this as a warning.

165
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,673
Unfortunately, this is not the dead man
that's gonna make us famous.

166
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,432
Let's keep moving.

167
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,073
Look at it, Alex.

168
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,593
Look at it!

169
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,159
Chu Wah!

170
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,512
- Chu Wah.
- No, no, don't, don't, don't.

171
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,194
Alex, Alex, they're dead! Come on.

172
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,272
This kind of danger goes with the territory.
You know that better than anyone.

173
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,588
Alex!

174
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,233
- Yes?
- Okay.

175
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,673
- Yes?
- Yeah.

176
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,677
All right, good chap. Okay. Good chap.
Oh, Jesus.

177
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,916
All the warriors are facing in to this point,

178
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,197
- as if awaiting an order from the Emperor.
- Well, then, where is he?

179
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,671
Listen, you don't think some bloody grave
robber's beaten us to the prize, do you?

180
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,398
No, he's still here.

181
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,552
You see, this is a feng shui compass.

182
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,874
Okay. Now. This...

183
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,791
Okay, this is true north,

184
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,953
but the feng shui compass
is set in the opposite direction.

185
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,031
- All right, we need to realign it.
- All right.

186
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,111
- All right, here we go.
- All right.

187
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,076
Alex! Alex, speak to me!

188
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,232
Are you all right?

189
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,749
- Alex!
- I'm fine.

190
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,308
Tell me, have we found the Emperor?

191
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,194
Alex!

192
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,874
What is it?

193
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,793
It's only the greatest find since King Tut!

194
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,274
"If he is awakened,
all mortals should despair."

195
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,237
It's definitely him!

196
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,715
Even had his concubines buried alive
with him.

197
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,119
Selfish bastard.

198
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,712
Hey, Professor Wilson,
you want to come down and take a look?

199
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,837
Or are you so overwhelmed you can't talk?

200
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,119
Wilson!

201
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,317
Let's go, Professor.
We've got a lot of work to do.

202
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,276
All right.

203
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,758
First of all, I'd just like to say

204
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,957
that the Foreign Office appreciates
all that you did during the war.

205
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,192
But I've been sent to offer you
one last assignment.

206
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,078
I'm afraid we've retired
from the espionage game, haven't we, dear?

207
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,230
Yeah, we've... We don't do that any more.
We're finished.

208
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,550
- Not at all.
- Completely done.

209
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,597
But just out of curiosity,
what is the mission anyway?

210
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,877
We need you to courier this to Shanghai.

211
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,431
- Nice piece of ice.
- It's the Eye of Shangri-La.

212
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,876
If you believe the legend,
it points the way to the Pool of Eternal Life.

213
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,030
It was smuggled out of China in 1940.

214
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,759
Now, the government would like
to return it to the Shanghai Museum

215
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,116
as a sign of good faith
to the Chinese people.

216
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,954
And with your expertise in the field,
we naturally thought of you.

217
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,838
Oh, we'd be so flattered.

218
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,515
But Rick and I, we made a promise
to each other after the war

219
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,558
that we would settle down.

220
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,359
- That's right, yeah, we did, didn't we? We...
- I see.

221
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,238
Well, I must admit I am a little disappointed.

222
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,596
Postwar China is very dangerous.

223
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:52,390
There are a lot of factions that would love
to get their hands on the Eye of Shangri-La.

224
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,950
In lesser hands,
the Eye could be lost forever.

225
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,312
We couldn't let that happen, could we?

226
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,709
No, that could be bad for the world.

227
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,870
- The world... Terrible.
- Yeah.

228
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,433
You know, she has a brother
who lives in Shanghai.

229
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,272
- Jonathan!
- Yes.

230
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,157
He owns a nightclub, if I'm not mistaken.

231
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,639
We have been meaning to visit. We could...

232
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,948
- We should...
...drop in and surprise him.

233
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,632
- Say hello.
- Why not?

234
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,871
Does this mean
we can count on you one last time?

235
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,149
Yes.

236
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,352
SHANGHAI, CHINA

237
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,317
CHINESE NEW YEAR, 1947

238
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,229
There we are.

239
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,876
Here's to you, Princess.

240
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,077
And Imhotep.
May the bugger actually stay dead.

241
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,633
Ding-dong.

242
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,795
Hi, can you buy a drink for me?

243
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,438
Excuse me. Alex! Alex! You're back again.

244
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,919
Come here, Alex. Let me get you a drink.

245
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,389
Smooth special for the pup, huh?
The explorer.

246
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,799
Make that two.

247
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,314
Sorry, Uncle Jon, but I got a better offer.

248
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,949
No, no, Alex. No, look.
Listen, how can I... Come here.

249
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,758
To put it in archaeological terms,

250
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,956
that's a tomb
in which many pharaohs have lain.

251
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,838
Now, listen, listen,
just think about me for a moment, all right?

252
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,549
Your discovery will go public in a few days,
and your parents are sure to find out.

253
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,074
They're not gonna be happy
you've dropped out of school. And...

254
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,835
Will you relax, Uncle Jon? Okay? I'm here.
They're a long way away.

255
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,639
- Alex...
- Excuse me, okay?

256
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,915
I have some excavation to do.

257
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,039
Jonathan!

258
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,157
You're in China! Evy. Rick.

259
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,515
What are you... It's so...
I didn't even...

260
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,672
Brother, how lovely to see you.

261
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,432
I had no idea he was here!

262
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,919
- Who was here?
- Who?

263
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,791
This happens every time!

264
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,750
Every man in the bar!

265
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,875
- Dad?
- Alex!

266
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,552
I don't know what to do with you!
- He's just a boy!

267
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,837
- I can't leave the room for 10 minutes!
- I didn't... Go away! Go to hell!

268
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,876
- I'm sick of it!
- Let's go get lover-boy!

269
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,837
I'm gonna kill you, kid!

270
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,070
Not so fast, that's my kid.

271
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,197
- Mad Dog Maguire?
- Ricochet O'Connell.

272
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,069
- Hey, hey.
- What are you doing here?

273
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,913
- Alex! Sweetheart! Are you all right?
- Just a little family get-together, folks.

274
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,276
Come on,
let's get back to having a good time. Music!

275
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,749
How long has it been?

276
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,559
Egypt, '23. French Foreign Legion.

277
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,757
This guy could land a plane
on anything, you...

278
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,354
- Why are you here?
- Ricochet, he had his hands all over me girl.

279
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,635
Now, son or no son,
I gotta give him a beating!

280
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,950
- Get out of the way, Dad.
- Sit down.

281
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,679
Now as much as I'd really like you
to teach him a valuable lesson...

282
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,352
His mother would be upset! Very upset.

283
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,919
You have a lot of explaining to do,
young man.

284
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,149
I got a wife now, and a kid.

285
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,310
Things are a little bit different,
I'm sure you understand.

286
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,038
- Yeah.
- Let me make it up to you.

287
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,316
We're just surprised to see you here.
That's all.

288
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,753
Who's gonna pay
for all this damage?

289
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,068
All right?

290
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,149
I'm not here five minutes,

291
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,037
and I'm already pulling your fanny
out of the fire.

292
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,109
You're going back to college.

293
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,237
How'd you think this was gonna work, Dad?
You two show up, tell me what to do?

294
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,598
No. But we should sit down
and discuss this like a family.

295
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,353
No offence, Mom,
but we haven't been a family in a long time.

296
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,396
Hey, don't you turn your back on me. Alex!

297
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,710
Alex, just... Alex, come here.

298
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,073
Can you...

299
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,436
Don't look at me like that.

300
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,355
- It's all your fault!
- My fault?

301
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,078
You're the one
that's always smothering him.

302
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,594
You couldn't leave him alone
for five minutes without wiping his nose.

303
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,275
Perhaps I was overcompensating for the fact
that you never took an interest in his life.

304
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,920
His life was my top priority.

305
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,468
How many times did I save that kid
from breaking his neck?

306
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,710
A little warmth and encouragement
would have been nice.

307
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,394
I'm his father. It's implied.

308
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,115
We've spent our entire lives
searching for priceless artefacts,

309
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,713
and the one thing
that's most precious to us,

310
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,789
we've lost.

311
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,230
We can't let Alex become some stranger
in pictures on our mantle.

312
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,632
- We can't let that happen.
- No, we can't.

313
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,756
How are we gonna fix this?

314
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,396
We need to do it together.

315
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,838
PARAMILITARY OUTPOST
WESTERN CHINA

316
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,073
The O'Connells are in Shanghai.

317
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,029
Do they have the Eye of Shangri-La?

318
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,395
Our spy says they do.

319
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,869
Good.

320
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,195
Assemble the troops!

321
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,269
Yes sir.

322
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,589
Soldiers!

323
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,436
Soon all our training and sacrifice...

324
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,514
will bear great fruit.

325
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,637
It is my dream to raise our Emperor
from his tomb.

326
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,312
Only He can bring order out of this chaos.

327
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,309
Soldiers...

328
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,029
tonight our great battle begins!

329
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,116
You know, this might have been faster
if we took a rickshaw.

330
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,430
It's Chinese New Year.

331
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,509
Don't you just love this country?

332
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,831
They have so many extra little holidays,
and drinking is mandatory.

333
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,388
I can't believe
we get to see your first big discovery.

334
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,469
It's so exciting.

335
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,949
Well, after last night,
I'm surprised you want to see it at all.

336
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,874
Listen,
I'll pick you up in about an hour.

337
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,188
You're not coming?

338
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,477
No, no,
I've seen enough mummies to last a lifetime.

339
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,719
There he is.

340
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,596
Oh, my darling, very impressive.

341
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,158
When do you get to open the sarcophagus?

342
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,196
Well,
after the official red tape has been cut.

343
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,431
Do the words "rest in peace"
mean anything to you two?

344
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:53,069
So, Mom, why don't you stick around
for the next few days,

345
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,354
and we can open it together?

346
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,793
I would like that very much, thanks.

347
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,075
Alex, why don't you go
and tell Professor Wilson

348
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,151
that we're here. You know...

349
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,559
No problem. Great.

350
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,677
Just don't wake the big guy up
while I'm gone.

351
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,559
Hey, Alex.

352
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:17,631
You know, this is all really, really big stuff.

353
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,831
Whatever you say, Dad.

354
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,594
What?

355
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:05,395
You just have a certain glow about you
this evening I haven't seen in a long time.

356
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,638
I guess mummies bring out the best in me.

357
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,190
Take a wrong turn at Cairo?
Sorry to interrupt.

358
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,637
- Roger.
- Professor Roger Wilson.

359
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,994
Rick.

360
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,470
You know, when Alex told me
that you had gone legit,

361
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,516
I just couldn't believe my ears.

362
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,149
Well, now I just pillage tombs
in the name of preservation. Evelyn.

363
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,199
- Congratulations on your latest discovery.
- Alex deserves all the credit.

364
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,271
He's one hell of a kid.
He's like the son I never had.

365
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,634
And he's the only one we've got,

366
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,676
so the next time you send him
on one of your field trips,

367
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,988
you give us the heads-up first.

368
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,355
Yes, yes, of course.

369
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,716
And now, I believe you have
something that belongs to us.

370
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,313
What's that?

371
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,958
Oh, you mean this?

372
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,913
I'm sorry...

373
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,232
There, go ahead.

374
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,038
All yours, Rog.

375
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,428
I knew I could rely on you two.

376
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,913
I'm afraid your work is not done yet,
Mr and Mrs O'Connell.

377
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,754
I'd like to introduce you to a friend of mine.
General Yang.

378
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,989
Roger!

379
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,592
Well, he is the man who financed Alex's dig.
We're in this together.

380
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,351
Cheek by jowl. General.

381
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,713
Search him.

382
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,519
No. The Eye belongs to the Chinese people.
You can't do this.

383
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,912
So, Rog, you snake, how much did...

384
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,673
Is it Yin and Yang? ...pay you?

385
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,194
Enough to pull strings at the Foreign Office,

386
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,512
make sure that it was you two
who delivered the Eye. Turn around.

387
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,434
The Eye contains the elixir
from the Pool of Eternal Life.

388
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,113
I need you to open it, Mrs O'Connell.

389
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,469
No.

390
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,430
You're going to use it to wake the Emperor,
aren't you?

391
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,513
And his Terracotta Army.
At least, that's the general idea.

392
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,990
Raising an army of mummies is insane.
Listen, Yang...

393
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,232
Easy! Go easy.

394
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,032
Time to open the sarcophagus. Move!

395
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,597
Read the inscription! Now!

396
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,954
Ancient Chinese isn't my forte.

397
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,430
Here's some encouragement. Wilson!

398
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,549
I'll do it!

399
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,189
No, Evy, don't do it!
They're just gonna kill me, anyway.

400
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,679
The inscription says
that only a drop of blood

401
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,832
from a person of pure heart
can open the Eye.

402
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,711
Your husband was right.

403
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,959
No!

404
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,837
Only the pure of heart would sacrifice
themselves for the one they love.

405
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,599
Open it.

406
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,158
You never called after our last date.

407
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,470
I don't have time for games, Alex.

408
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,791
You know my name, but I don't know yours.

409
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,029
It's Lin.

410
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,510
You want to explain to me
why you tried to kill me?

411
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,669
We could do that.

412
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,478
Or we could save your parents.

413
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,840
Wilson, you son of a bitch!

414
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,231
- Get on with it, O'Connell.
- All right.

415
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:55,753
Once this touches him,
the Emperor will rise to rule again.

416
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,789
Finish him off.

417
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,035
Alex, please! Don't. That's...

418
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,750
Don't, don't. Don't, please.

419
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,400
No, don't, Alex, it's me. Please.

420
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,435
It's not him. This is a eunuch! It's a decoy!

421
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,316
Where the hell's the Emperor?

422
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,754
Stay!

423
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,432
Here we go again.

424
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,037
I live to serve you, my Lord.

425
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,633
I can help you become immortal.

426
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,439
If you are lying, you will burn.

427
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:15,433
Wait! Wait! You wait for me!
I'm coming with you! Wait, wait...

428
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,599
Watch out!

429
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,434
We got to put this mummy down fast!
The longer we wait, the stronger they get!

430
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,750
Open the gate! Open the gate!

431
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,475
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. Sorry, pal.
There's a mummy on the loose.

432
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,788
- You wanna drive?
- Why not?

433
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,598
God, I love a woman who can drive a truck.

434
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,638
Hey, pal, I'm really sorry,
but you know what? Happy New Year!

435
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,188
Hit it, honey!

436
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,958
No! Move over!

437
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,792
What? No!

438
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,154
No!

439
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,234
No!

440
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,154
- What?
- Jonathan, get in the back!

441
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,509
Sorry about the Rolls!

442
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,909
You guys are like mummy magnets!

443
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,988
- We have to turn you around!
- Okay.

444
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,993
Excuse me.

445
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,954
- Hey, we could use this!
- Give me that!

446
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,476
- Oh, yeah, that's a better idea.
- Size counts!

447
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,358
Stop mucking about! They're getting away!

448
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,912
Just drive!

449
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,676
Aim for the Emperor!
- Aim for the Emperor?

450
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,320
- Light it up, Jonathan!
- I'm trying!

451
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,469
Fire!

452
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,713
Did we get him?

453
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,836
- Fire!
- What, again?

454
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,751
- Your ass is on fire!
- My ass?

455
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,637
- Hold still!
- Rick, my ass is on fire!

456
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,119
- Well, spank my...
- I'm putting it out!

457
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,872
- Put me out, Rick!
- Just hold still!

458
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,155
Spank my ass! Spank my ass!

459
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,117
All right, here I come!

460
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,678
Give me your hand!

461
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,629
Come on!

462
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,553
Watch out!

463
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,509
Evy, where are you going?

464
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,636
- Taking a short cut!
- Evy!

465
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,676
- I told you it was a short cut!
- Right!

466
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,557
Now he's chasing us!

467
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,074
Hurry!

468
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,760
Give me your hand.
Here, you're gonna need these.

469
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,637
- Don't wait up for me.
- Where are you going?

470
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,789
Out!

471
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,240
- Where's Rick?
- Where do you think?

472
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,519
Damn it!

473
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,913
You're mine!

474
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,350
- Give me your hand and get on this horse!
- Get back, Dad!

475
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,195
Alexander Rupert O'Connell, you get
on the back of this horse this instant!

476
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,193
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Oh, God!

477
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,275
Evy!

478
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,833
We've got to go back and help Rick!

479
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,673
Rick! Forget Rick!
Here they come!

480
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,472
I'll go after the Emperor.

481
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,199
Trust me. I've got a little more experience
with mummies.

482
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,636
And I have the only weapon
that can kill him.

483
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,029
Okay. I'll cover you. Let's go!

484
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,155
Lin!

485
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,754
- I thought you were dead!
- He missed.

486
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,993
Look out!

487
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:33,717
- Thanks, Rick. Could you get the cab?
- Does it look like I have a wallet?

488
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,599
You know, I would have killed the Emperor
if you two hadn't blown my cover.

489
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,874
I had everything under control.

490
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,110
Oh, yeah, that's exactly
what we were thinking.

491
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,952
Yeah, well, good going,
you raised another mummy.

492
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,917
And this bugger's got superpowers.

493
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,117
He's got control over fire, water,
metal and who knows what else.

494
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,235
And you dug him up anyway.

495
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,992
Yeah, well, you're not gonna
pin this one on me, okay, Dad?

496
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,230
- Am I?
- Oh, stop it, you two.

497
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,596
No one's to blame here.
Wilson manipulated all of us.

498
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,749
Yeah, that's true.

499
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,831
I apologise for my parents.

500
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,639
But I thought we worked
really well together.

501
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,792
Except we failed.

502
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,071
I'm sorry,
we haven't been properly introduced.

503
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,628
- Who are you exactly?
- My name is Lin.

504
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,951
My family has watched
over the Emperor's tomb for centuries.

505
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,192
The Emperor cannot be killed unless
he is stabbed through the heart with this.

506
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,874
My mother put a curse on it long ago.

507
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,189
Mmm-hmm.

508
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,634
Well, a quick family meeting, Alex.

509
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,799
- Sit.
- Down.

510
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,671
What do you really know about this girl?

511
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:57,311
Well, not much, but after her help tonight,
I'm willing to go on a little faith.

512
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,197
- Faith.
- Time is running out.

513
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,669
You don't really believe in the concept
of personal space, do you?

514
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,116
If the Emperor reaches Shangri-La
and drinks from the Pool of Eternal Life,

515
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,953
he will raise his army
and no one will be safe.

516
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,474
Much as I'd like to stay
this boyishly handsome forever,

517
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,959
Shangri-La is a crock.

518
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,917
Yeah, but that's what you used to say
about mummies, too, Jon.

519
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,036
- You did pretty well off it.
- Good point.

520
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:20,352
The Gateway to Shangri-La lies in
a mountain pass high in the Himalayas.

521
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,510
Beyond it is a golden tower.

522
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:26,149
Once the diamond is placed at the top,
it will point the way to Shangri-La.

523
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,196
Yang still has the diamond,

524
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,158
and that's where
he and the Emperor will go.

525
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,669
She's right.

526
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,718
All the legends of the Eye
mention the Gateway.

527
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,870
I like her, Alex. She knows what's what.

528
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:43,239
Now, just say that we were to believe you,
could you guide us there?

529
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,596
Yes. I have been there once.
I remember the way.

530
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,675
Himalayas. We're going to need a plane.

531
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,433
Well, I know just the Mad Dog for the job.

532
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,478
Well, any self-respecting pilot
would land on the valley floor,

533
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,232
but I don't have any self-respect,

534
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,470
so I'll put you down
halfway up the mountain.

535
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,232
That should give us a good advantage.

536
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,311
Of course,
I can't guarantee any of us will live.

537
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,549
Great!

538
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,869
I'd tell you to fasten your seatbelts,
but I was too cheap to buy any!

539
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,835
- Why am I laughing?
- Here we go!

540
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,877
Mad Dog, Mad Dog!
Ease up, ease up, ease up!

541
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,639
Oh, God!

542
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,752
Maguire!

543
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,873
Come on, man!

544
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,514
Mad Dog!

545
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,072
Brake! No, no! Nobody move.

546
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,799
Nobody move, nobody move!

547
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,830
What is that God-awful smell?

548
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,712
The yak yakked.

549
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,190
Welcome to the modern world, my Lord.

550
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,551
Why did you raise me?

551
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,999
I love this land.
Only you can lead us back to greatness.

552
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,115
What is in it for you?

553
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,313
I want to serve as your general.

554
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,355
The last general I trusted...

555
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,313
betrayed me.

556
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,519
I will not make that mistake.

557
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:56,037
I cannot escape this curse
until I am immortal...

558
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,233
General.

559
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,791
I understand, my Lord.

560
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,789
We need to find the Pool of Eternal Life.

561
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,349
This will point the way.

562
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,592
<i>Can't you see it's Mr McGuire</i>

563
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,432
<i>come to court your sister Kate</i>

564
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:38,433
<i>You know very well he owns the farm</i>
<i>a wee bit out...</i>

565
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,317
<i>Delta-Tango-Alpha</i>
<i>to Ricochet. Come in, Ricochet.</i>

566
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,629
Delta-Tango-Alpha, this is Ricochet.
Go ahead, Mad Dog.

567
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,075
Yeah, you know that Yang fellow
you told me to keep me eye out for?

568
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,309
<i>He's just shown up.</i>

569
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,550
Ricochet out. Thanks, Mad Dog.

570
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,232
That's us, people! Let's go!

571
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,072
- Jonathan, wake up!
- What...

572
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,953
Hold the line!

573
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,435
Good, we're a little more than halfway.

574
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,910
We're gonna...
We're gonna camp up there for the night.

575
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:42,233
Lin says if we leave at first light,
we'll reach the Gateway by noon.

576
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:47,508
Did she happen to mention how she knows
so much about the Gateway?

577
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,273
No, not really. Kind of mysterious.

578
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,679
She's certainly managed to enchant you.

579
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,320
Come on, Alex. You obviously like her.

580
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,630
Mom, the thin mountain air,
clearly messing with your head.

581
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,556
Whatever secret she's hiding,

582
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,796
I just don't want to see you get hurt.

583
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,190
I appreciate that, but, you know,

584
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:18,159
I've had my fair share of experience
with the opposite sex.

585
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,355
Really?

586
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,713
How many experiences
are we talking about?

587
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:29,954
Well, you shouldn't ask questions you don't
want to know the answer to, okay, Mom?

588
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,109
Right.

589
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,997
Hey, Mom.

590
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,390
I'm sorry I blamed you guys
for raising the Emperor.

591
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,712
What's so funny?

592
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,998
My mother is under the impression
there's something between us.

593
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,991
I hope nothing romantic.

594
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:07,316
Yeah, well, I told her there
was no chance of that.

595
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,675
We're complete opposites,
you and me, right?

596
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:14,595
You guard tombs. I raid them.
You like ancient knives. I'm into guns.

597
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,635
Those are some
pretty insurmountable odds.

598
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,870
- Absolutely.
- Well, good.

599
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:24,759
Now that we've cleared that up,
we can focus on taking down the Emperor.

600
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,398
I agree totally.

601
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,514
Besides, you're not my type.

602
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:38,319
Of course not. You don't like a woman
who can knock you on your backside.

603
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,829
The expression is "kick my ass."

604
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,189
And for the record, you didn't.

605
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,917
Yeah, it's not easy being me, you know.

606
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,638
Then again, I don't suppose
it's easy being you,

607
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,790
is it, Geraldine, old girl?

608
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,996
If I'd met a girl like you, Geraldine...

609
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,878
You know, hard-working,
you don't say much,

610
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,156
you're a little bit hairy, but I don't mind that.

611
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,950
There it is! We found it!

612
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,556
The Gateway of Shangri-La!

613
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:38,548
Go, girl! Go! You're free!

614
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,712
Go, Geraldine! Live free!

615
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,074
What did you do now? Rob an armoury?

616
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,475
Have you ever seen a Walther P38?

617
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,710
Looks pretty anaemic
compared to the Peacekeeper.

618
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:03,031
Well, it's not about size, Dad.
It's about stamina.

619
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,919
You want power?

620
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:13,155
I give you the Thompson submachine gun.
Fifty rounds a drum.

621
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:16,277
- Twenty-five a mag.
- Tommy's good, Dad,

622
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,998
but the cocking mechanism always jams.

623
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:22,278
Here. Check out the Russian PPS
Personal Assault Weapon.

624
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,998
Now, this is the future right here.

625
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:27,311
You know, it's experience that wins the day.
It's not all about firepower.

626
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,277
Boys! If I may...

627
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,157
Do we have a plan for the Emperor?

628
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,117
Yeah. We're gonna hit him
high, hard and fast

629
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,872
and smash him like a Ming vase.

630
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,952
- And if that doesn't work?
- We go to plan B.

631
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:41,077
Plan B! You go upstairs,
you blow up that gold tower thing.

632
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,196
- You light it up. We blow the guy sky high!
- Me?

633
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,269
- You! What?
- Dad?

634
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,396
So if the explosion doesn't kill us,
the avalanche will.

635
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,913
- You got a better idea?
- Yeah. I do.

636
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,797
I say we ambush him
with long-range rifles and silencers.

637
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:50,915
Long-range, that's a better idea.

638
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,035
Yeah, we can get in close, Dad.

639
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,189
- Much better idea.
- And then we can finish him off

640
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,838
- with Lin's dagger.
- Look, I'm sorry,

641
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,480
I just don't put much faith
in your girlfriend's magic dagger.

642
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,676
- Okay, Dad, she is not my girlfriend.
- You say that now,

643
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,751
- but I still don't trust her.
- Well, I do.

644
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,434
- So you should trust my judgement, okay?
- Look, kid,

645
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,112
I've put down more mummies
in my time than you.

646
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,553
You put down one mummy, Dad.

647
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,712
Yeah. Same mummy twice!

648
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,679
Hand me the green wire,
will you, please?

649
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,511
Are you sure you know what you are doing?

650
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,670
Of course. I've done this a hundred times.

651
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:26,196
If the Emperor places the Eye up there,
all will be lost.

652
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,152
Clear a path to the Golden Tower.

653
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,558
Prove yourself to me.

654
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,878
Let's give a warm O'Connell welcome!

655
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,115
Fire!

656
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,908
Bazooka!

657
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,199
Fall back!

658
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,475
Alex! Follow me!

659
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,872
We gotta take out those bazookas!

660
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:55,989
Go!

661
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,039
Fall back!

662
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,551
Move! Move! Move! Move!

663
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,115
Time to go to plan B! Blow up the tower!

664
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,997
Hey, I'm actually a little bit concerned
about plan B!

665
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,433
Couldn't we go straight to plan C?

666
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:23,034
Just make it go bang! I'll cover you!

667
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,388
Come on.

668
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,350
All right, let's go, go, go!
Come on, come on!

669
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,192
Come on. Oh, be good.

670
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,679
Set up a crossfire!

671
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,514
Move it!

672
01:00:00,656 --> 01:00:02,294
My last round!

673
01:00:25,016 --> 01:00:29,009
- Abominable snowmen?
- The Tibetans call them yeti!

674
01:00:32,976 --> 01:00:34,329
Please! I need your help!

675
01:00:34,576 --> 01:00:36,532
These soldiers are evil!

676
01:00:38,616 --> 01:00:40,288
She speaks Yeti?

677
01:00:56,216 --> 01:00:57,808
Shoot! Kill them!

678
01:01:05,336 --> 01:01:08,009
Why do I always have to save the day?

679
01:01:08,616 --> 01:01:09,890
I hate it when the kid's right!

680
01:01:13,976 --> 01:01:15,568
Get the other guy!

681
01:01:16,496 --> 01:01:17,645
Thanks!

682
01:01:41,976 --> 01:01:43,204
Trouble!

683
01:02:21,136 --> 01:02:23,604
You can die slow or you can die fast.

684
01:02:44,776 --> 01:02:47,051
Yes! Yes! Yes!

685
01:02:48,336 --> 01:02:50,725
Yeah! I did it!

686
01:02:51,376 --> 01:02:55,528
Oh, Mother, I did it!
Time for a retreat, I think.

687
01:03:00,536 --> 01:03:05,326
I'm on your team! I'm a team player!
"One for all and all for me" kind of thing!

688
01:03:06,256 --> 01:03:09,646
The dynamite, all this dynamite!
We should get out of here!

689
01:03:24,816 --> 01:03:26,249
Back off! Back off!

690
01:03:26,576 --> 01:03:28,089
Run!

691
01:03:54,736 --> 01:03:58,206
I hate mummies!
They never play fair!

692
01:04:05,936 --> 01:04:08,211
Dad! Dad, what are you doing?

693
01:04:15,576 --> 01:04:19,012
Over here! Over here! Come on! Over here!

694
01:04:19,776 --> 01:04:21,095
Oh, no!

695
01:04:26,496 --> 01:04:27,531
Rick!

696
01:04:54,816 --> 01:04:56,693
Shangri-La.

697
01:05:05,056 --> 01:05:06,694
That's a diamond.

698
01:05:09,096 --> 01:05:10,575
I could use a diamond like that.

699
01:05:32,376 --> 01:05:33,604
Dad!

700
01:05:40,256 --> 01:05:42,690
Okay, hold it. Hold on there, Dad.

701
01:05:42,776 --> 01:05:45,768
All right, please, please, please
put pressure on it, okay, Dad?

702
01:05:45,856 --> 01:05:49,053
It's all right, it's all right.
We've been in tougher scrapes than this.

703
01:05:55,336 --> 01:05:56,894
Avalanche!

704
01:06:28,136 --> 01:06:30,206
- Help! Help me!
- Lin!

705
01:06:35,096 --> 01:06:36,529
Please! Help me!

706
01:07:16,536 --> 01:07:17,855
Yes!

707
01:07:19,136 --> 01:07:21,570
I've got it! And I'm still alive!

708
01:07:25,296 --> 01:07:27,730
Help me, please.
Somebody help me!

709
01:07:28,456 --> 01:07:31,175
- We're over here! Over here!
- Alex?

710
01:07:31,256 --> 01:07:33,724
- Mom, Mom, we're down here!
- Alex?

711
01:07:34,056 --> 01:07:35,455
We're over here!

712
01:07:47,336 --> 01:07:48,564
Oh, God.

713
01:07:49,936 --> 01:07:53,645
We've got to take him to Shangri-La now!
It's our only chance.

714
01:08:12,416 --> 01:08:13,735
We made it!

715
01:08:30,896 --> 01:08:32,249
The Pool.

716
01:08:42,896 --> 01:08:44,011
Mother.

717
01:08:45,456 --> 01:08:46,445
My sweet daughter.

718
01:08:54,976 --> 01:08:56,011
I beg you...

719
01:08:57,696 --> 01:08:59,493
My father is dying.

720
01:08:59,936 --> 01:09:01,164
They are my friends.

721
01:09:02,136 --> 01:09:03,455
Oh, please.

722
01:09:38,296 --> 01:09:39,615
Thank you.

723
01:09:40,976 --> 01:09:43,888
He must rest. We'll take him to my chamber.

724
01:10:01,136 --> 01:10:04,526
Where are you going, General?
Our destiny awaits.

725
01:10:09,496 --> 01:10:14,012
Well, it's not everyone that gets
their brother-in-law back from the dead.

726
01:10:14,616 --> 01:10:17,813
Yeah, give me my four score years
and ten any day.

727
01:10:22,616 --> 01:10:24,413
Is this Shangri-La?

728
01:10:33,976 --> 01:10:36,695
I could live here. Lots of opportunity.

729
01:10:38,616 --> 01:10:40,015
A casino.

730
01:10:44,736 --> 01:10:47,933
I was wrong to involve you in my revenge.

731
01:10:48,456 --> 01:10:49,889
No, mother.

732
01:10:50,936 --> 01:10:53,006
I would do anything for you.

733
01:11:01,936 --> 01:11:04,211
He's resting well. Thank you.

734
01:11:05,896 --> 01:11:08,205
How'd you get involved in all this?

735
01:11:08,296 --> 01:11:13,131
The Emperor murdered the only man
I ever loved, Lin's father.

736
01:11:14,576 --> 01:11:17,295
I would have died, too, by his hand,

737
01:11:17,376 --> 01:11:21,130
if the yeti had not found me
and brought me to this pool.

738
01:11:21,216 --> 01:11:24,174
Hang on a second.
How did this all happen?

739
01:11:24,256 --> 01:11:26,133
This was before Christ.

740
01:11:28,976 --> 01:11:31,649
How long were you guarding his tomb?

741
01:11:31,736 --> 01:11:33,328
Over 2,000 years.

742
01:11:39,256 --> 01:11:41,451
The Emperor must never be
allowed to reach the Pool,

743
01:11:41,536 --> 01:11:44,334
or he will have the power to raise his army.

744
01:11:44,416 --> 01:11:45,974
And once he becomes immortal,

745
01:11:46,056 --> 01:11:49,935
he can transform himself into
the most hideous creatures ever seen.

746
01:11:50,016 --> 01:11:52,849
I will take the first watch at the entrance.

747
01:11:59,296 --> 01:12:02,686
You know, I have no problem
dating an older woman.

748
01:12:05,456 --> 01:12:07,686
I'm afraid we can't be together.

749
01:12:08,576 --> 01:12:11,044
Wait. What? Why?

750
01:12:12,696 --> 01:12:15,130
Because I'm going to live forever.

751
01:12:15,856 --> 01:12:18,086
I don't want to watch you die.

752
01:12:18,976 --> 01:12:20,773
So what? That's it?

753
01:12:21,696 --> 01:12:24,608
You're just gonna sit
on the sidelines for eternity?

754
01:12:24,696 --> 01:12:27,654
My mother has mourned
my father for centuries.

755
01:12:28,216 --> 01:12:30,810
I don't know if my heart can bear it.

756
01:12:35,296 --> 01:12:38,333
People can live an entire lifetime
in one look.

757
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:42,845
I watch my parents do it every day.

758
01:12:45,816 --> 01:12:46,726
Alex?

759
01:12:48,256 --> 01:12:50,724
Your father's awake. Get up here!

760
01:13:03,056 --> 01:13:04,250
Hello.

761
01:13:07,016 --> 01:13:10,053
If this is heaven, it looks pretty good so far.

762
01:13:17,936 --> 01:13:20,404
Nice to see some things never change.

763
01:13:37,776 --> 01:13:40,165
Go easy on him. He feels terrible.

764
01:13:45,616 --> 01:13:48,005
When I saw you lying there, Dad...

765
01:13:48,336 --> 01:13:51,089
I've never been so scared in my life.

766
01:13:52,616 --> 01:13:54,766
Well, that makes two of us.

767
01:13:55,776 --> 01:13:58,609
I mean, you know,
you're not supposed to die, you know?

768
01:13:58,696 --> 01:14:00,652
You're Ricochet O'Connell, right?

769
01:14:00,736 --> 01:14:03,853
You get beat up, you get tossed around,

770
01:14:03,936 --> 01:14:06,450
but, well, you're always standing there
in the end.

771
01:14:06,536 --> 01:14:09,608
I never really thought of
the world without you.

772
01:14:13,136 --> 01:14:14,535
Alex,

773
01:14:16,416 --> 01:14:18,088
the truth is,

774
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,128
I'm just trying to...

775
01:14:24,136 --> 01:14:26,013
I'm just...

776
01:14:26,096 --> 01:14:27,245
I'm trying to be a good husband.

777
01:14:27,336 --> 01:14:28,655
I'm trying to be a good parent.

778
01:14:28,736 --> 01:14:32,172
And the truth is,
I've been dropping the ball lately, and...

779
01:14:32,256 --> 01:14:35,089
No, you know, I haven't been
the world's greatest son, you know?

780
01:14:35,176 --> 01:14:39,055
No, no, that's 'cause you get it
from her side of the family.

781
01:14:39,136 --> 01:14:40,455
Come here.

782
01:14:43,976 --> 01:14:45,250
My boys.

783
01:14:49,656 --> 01:14:52,375
You look tired, you should rest.

784
01:14:53,336 --> 01:14:54,451
I'll stay.

785
01:14:55,576 --> 01:14:57,646
Fate is about to deal its final hand.

786
01:14:57,976 --> 01:15:00,126
If we are to defeat the Emperor...

787
01:15:00,456 --> 01:15:03,926
I must ask for one more sacrifice.

788
01:15:04,336 --> 01:15:05,530
Anything, mother.

789
01:15:07,376 --> 01:15:09,367
Your immortality.

790
01:15:20,856 --> 01:15:23,370
Oh, no! His powers have been fully restored!

791
01:15:23,456 --> 01:15:24,730
Time to go.

792
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:49,651
General Ming's daughter.

793
01:15:50,456 --> 01:15:52,686
Your child will be mine.

794
01:16:01,136 --> 01:16:03,047
He is immortal.

795
01:16:30,576 --> 01:16:33,693
Hey! You three-headed shape-shifting
son of a bitch!

796
01:16:43,976 --> 01:16:44,965
Lin!

797
01:16:55,496 --> 01:16:56,690
Alex!

798
01:17:00,176 --> 01:17:01,211
Alex!

799
01:17:10,016 --> 01:17:12,132
He's taking her back to his tomb
to raise his army!

800
01:17:12,216 --> 01:17:15,208
- Is there a faster way down from here?
- The yeti. They'll help.

801
01:17:15,296 --> 01:17:17,287
But he's already in the air. It'll be too late!

802
01:17:17,376 --> 01:17:21,369
Mad Dog can outfly a three-headed lizard
any day of the week! Let's go.

803
01:17:26,536 --> 01:17:28,367
Portside! Nine o'clock!

804
01:17:35,296 --> 01:17:37,856
Rick? Should I quit drinking?

805
01:17:43,496 --> 01:17:44,485
<i>Jonathan to Rick.</i>

806
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:46,487
<i>You'd better get a move on if</i>
<i>you're gonna beat him to the tomb!</i>

807
01:17:46,576 --> 01:17:49,170
Yeah, yeah, just get back here as fast
as you can with the reinforcements.

808
01:17:49,256 --> 01:17:50,928
No sightseeing!

809
01:17:53,376 --> 01:17:55,048
Here, Dad.

810
01:17:55,136 --> 01:17:56,125
- Is that for me?
- Yeah.

811
01:17:56,216 --> 01:17:57,331
Nice.

812
01:17:58,096 --> 01:18:01,930
The Terracotta Army is not indestructible
until it crosses the Great Wall.

813
01:18:02,016 --> 01:18:05,247
That's comforting. How exactly are we
supposed to fend them off?

814
01:18:05,336 --> 01:18:06,530
When the Emperor built the Wall,

815
01:18:06,616 --> 01:18:07,935
he buried his enemies underneath it

816
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:10,325
and cursed their souls
to hold it up for eternity.

817
01:18:10,416 --> 01:18:15,126
Most of them were conquered soldiers.
I will call them to battle once again.

818
01:18:15,216 --> 01:18:20,495
Unlock an altar, raise an army.
That sounds like a plan. Let's go.

819
01:18:46,336 --> 01:18:47,451
Grab her.

820
01:18:48,136 --> 01:18:49,774
Guard her with your life.

821
01:18:52,736 --> 01:18:53,885
Alex?

822
01:18:56,096 --> 01:18:58,564
- Where'd he go?
- Where do you think?

823
01:19:15,616 --> 01:19:17,174
AWAKE!

824
01:20:49,456 --> 01:20:51,492
Today you awake to a world...

825
01:20:52,216 --> 01:20:54,491
in the grip of chaos and corruption.

826
01:20:54,576 --> 01:20:56,567
Open the gates of the past

827
01:20:56,656 --> 01:20:59,090
and free the souls
of the wrongfully damned.

828
01:20:59,776 --> 01:21:01,573
I will restore order...

829
01:21:02,256 --> 01:21:04,451
I will retake what is mine.

830
01:21:05,136 --> 01:21:07,650
I will crush any idea of freedom.

831
01:21:07,776 --> 01:21:10,768
In the name of the ancestors
and the righteous,

832
01:21:10,856 --> 01:21:14,087
I sacrifice my immortality
and that of my daughter

833
01:21:14,176 --> 01:21:15,973
so that you may rise this day!

834
01:21:16,096 --> 01:21:17,893
I will slaughter without mercy.

835
01:21:18,216 --> 01:21:20,605
I will conquer without compassion.

836
01:21:20,936 --> 01:21:23,166
I will now lead you past the Great Wall.

837
01:21:23,536 --> 01:21:26,972
Once you cross, you will be indestructible.

838
01:21:27,896 --> 01:21:32,845
Bring down the wrath of the oppressed
on this Emperor and all who follow him!

839
01:21:33,336 --> 01:21:35,372
I raised you for one purpose...

840
01:21:35,656 --> 01:21:38,295
to enforce my will on the entire world!

841
01:21:38,936 --> 01:21:40,335
Long live the Emperor!

842
01:21:42,816 --> 01:21:46,047
I call upon the hundreds and the thousands

843
01:21:46,136 --> 01:21:50,812
that you may rise up and seize this moment
to take your victory,

844
01:21:50,896 --> 01:21:54,525
to take your justice
and to take your revenge!

845
01:22:12,776 --> 01:22:14,255
Zi Yuan.

846
01:22:20,376 --> 01:22:21,889
It's General Ming!

847
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:23,894
Follow General Ming!

848
01:22:28,016 --> 01:22:31,008
Prepare for battle!

849
01:22:39,896 --> 01:22:42,694
These are...
They're good undead guys, right?

850
01:22:43,256 --> 01:22:46,168
Oh, no, no, no!

851
01:22:46,256 --> 01:22:48,451
Zi Yuan! Zi Yuan! Zi Yuan sent us!

852
01:22:48,536 --> 01:22:52,609
- Darling, I don't think he speaks English.
- We're with Zi Yuan!

853
01:22:52,696 --> 01:22:53,924
Zi Yuan?

854
01:22:54,456 --> 01:22:55,650
Right.

855
01:22:57,256 --> 01:22:58,484
Let's go.

856
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:00,730
To battle!

857
01:23:20,456 --> 01:23:24,415
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

858
01:23:27,136 --> 01:23:28,649
Archers form up!

859
01:23:32,696 --> 01:23:33,924
Incoming!

860
01:23:46,656 --> 01:23:50,615
- Hey! That's my favourite blue shirt.
- I've always hated that shirt.

861
01:24:06,216 --> 01:24:07,774
Death to General Ming!

862
01:24:11,616 --> 01:24:12,935
Charge!

863
01:24:22,736 --> 01:24:24,772
Welcome to the 20th century!

864
01:24:40,936 --> 01:24:43,291
We can't let them cross the wall!

865
01:26:06,456 --> 01:26:07,809
You are no longer immortal.

866
01:26:47,136 --> 01:26:49,775
Honey! Fall back to higher ground!

867
01:26:56,176 --> 01:26:58,406
I really hate mummies!

868
01:26:58,496 --> 01:27:00,726
It seems the feeling's mutual!

869
01:27:04,336 --> 01:27:06,372
Shut up, clay boy! Fore!

870
01:27:06,976 --> 01:27:08,091
Run!

871
01:27:20,496 --> 01:27:22,009
- Catch!
- Got it!

872
01:27:23,976 --> 01:27:28,174
Next time I say, "We've been in tougher
scrapes than this," I mean this!

873
01:27:52,776 --> 01:27:55,973
Die, you mummy bastards! Die!

874
01:27:56,056 --> 01:27:58,968
There is no call for bad language!

875
01:28:01,136 --> 01:28:04,253
Jonathan certainly knows
how to make an entrance!

876
01:28:29,776 --> 01:28:31,494
Any regrets, darling?

877
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:35,413
None. Not ever.

878
01:28:44,456 --> 01:28:47,254
- You okay?
- Yeah, sure, no problem.

879
01:28:47,336 --> 01:28:49,725
We had it completely under control.

880
01:28:52,456 --> 01:28:55,050
This guy ever run out of tricks?

881
01:28:59,256 --> 01:29:00,530
No!

882
01:29:07,456 --> 01:29:08,889
Mother! No!

883
01:29:11,616 --> 01:29:12,844
Mother!

884
01:29:17,576 --> 01:29:19,771
Mother! Mother!

885
01:29:29,656 --> 01:29:31,567
Pierce through his heart.

886
01:29:34,296 --> 01:29:38,608
You must live and fight on.

887
01:29:57,216 --> 01:29:59,684
She said through the heart.

888
01:29:59,776 --> 01:30:02,210
Through the heart. Let's go.

889
01:30:15,536 --> 01:30:16,571
Get in!

890
01:30:17,416 --> 01:30:20,010
The O'Connells are going to
stop the Emperor!

891
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:33,485
So, Dad, what's the plan?

892
01:30:33,576 --> 01:30:35,009
Divide and conquer!

893
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:38,054
No offence,
but isn't that a little short on detail?

894
01:30:38,736 --> 01:30:41,125
- Twelve o'clock low!
- Hang on!

895
01:30:49,056 --> 01:30:50,409
Remember our deal!

896
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:53,010
When this is over,
my men get to drink for free!

897
01:30:53,096 --> 01:30:55,894
You can have the whole damn bar
for all I care!

898
01:30:55,976 --> 01:30:58,570
I'm getting the hell out of China.

899
01:31:29,096 --> 01:31:31,451
I dug you up...

900
01:31:32,336 --> 01:31:34,691
and I'm gonna put you down.

901
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:07,375
Alex? Alex!

902
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:05,931
Let go!

903
01:33:06,016 --> 01:33:07,051
Never!

904
01:33:10,816 --> 01:33:13,649
Enough tricks! Where's your honour?

905
01:33:16,656 --> 01:33:18,294
Fight like a man!

906
01:33:55,456 --> 01:33:57,048
Divide

907
01:33:58,576 --> 01:33:59,975
and conquer.

908
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:47,455
Now you can rule in hell.

909
01:35:12,736 --> 01:35:14,408
The Emperor is dead.

910
01:35:14,696 --> 01:35:16,288
The Emperor is dead!

911
01:36:01,296 --> 01:36:05,255
- Evening, girls. You're looking well.
- Good evening, Mr Maguire.

912
01:36:06,096 --> 01:36:09,725
- It's a fine night to be me.
- You dance great for an old lady.

913
01:36:10,256 --> 01:36:12,690
Someone told me to stop living
on the sidelines.

914
01:36:12,776 --> 01:36:15,688
- Well, he sounds like a smart guy.
- He is.

915
01:36:27,216 --> 01:36:30,572
So I guess Dash and Scarlet
have their next adventure?

916
01:36:30,656 --> 01:36:33,409
Why write about it when you can live it?

917
01:36:34,496 --> 01:36:38,535
There's something incredibly romantic
about vanquishing the undead.

918
01:36:39,336 --> 01:36:41,804
Even more romantic doing it with you.

919
01:36:42,576 --> 01:36:45,295
- Kiss me.
- Don't have to ask me twice.

920
01:36:54,056 --> 01:36:55,648
- Can I get your bag, sir?
- No, no, no.

921
01:36:55,736 --> 01:36:57,647
Don't touch it, don't touch it.

922
01:36:57,736 --> 01:36:58,725
Where are you off to, Mr Carnahan?

923
01:36:58,816 --> 01:37:01,091
Someplace where they don't have mummies.

924
01:37:01,176 --> 01:37:03,895
- Step on it! I've got a plane to catch.
- Yes, sir.

925
01:37:03,976 --> 01:37:07,491
Yeah. <i>Ciao, ciao,</i> Shanghai.

926
01:37:07,576 --> 01:37:09,007
Peru,
here I come.

927
01:37:12,536 --> 01:37:16,814
Soon after, mummies were found in Peru.

928
01:47:01,856 --> 01:47:02,845
