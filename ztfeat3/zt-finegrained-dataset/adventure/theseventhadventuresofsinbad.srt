1
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:25,700
The Indian Ocean
640 km east of Madagascar.

2
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,700
Hold highest knot!  Steady settings!
1-9-0.

3
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,500
All head to the deck!

4
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,500
All head to the deck!

5
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,500
Throw hook to the pole!
Set it through!

6
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,640
Fire!

7
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,200
Ladies and gentlemen,

8
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,470
As we know the world simply can't wait
finding new sources of energy!

9
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,200
This is why Kamaran is proud to be moving
in the pulled direction!

10
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,800
Kamaran is a shipping company.
Isn't oil is expecting to be out of the will house?

11
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,500
- For 12 generations of my family
are distinguished itself as a shipping lane..

12
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,300
As my father compass's mine!

13
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,800
At this time I'd like to introduce to you
a new CEO, Mr. Magnus.

14
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,690
You're sinking money in energy extraction.
But what about spill prevention?

15
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,470
Clean up bio-remediation?

16
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,860
Kamaran has invested heavily...

17
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,110
...in clean up technology, including bio-remediation.

18
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,720
I think your time and our company's records...

19
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:14,980
...speak for itself!
I think your time and our company's records...

20
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,650
...speak for itself!

21
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:16,720
- Mr Sinbad, is it true the old dating
super model Samantha Farris?
...speak for itself!

22
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,000
- Mr Sinbad, is it true the old dating
super model Samantha Farris?

23
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,530
Finally something in mine will help!

24
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,870
If you will, ladies and gentlemen,
I'll give you the Pythias.

25
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,640
A prototype geological survey craft...

26
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,880
It operates in the depth of about 2 miles,

27
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,000
and helps to sum the new design
in sub-surface mineral deposit sands.

28
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,120
Now?

29
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,000
A much better is one on one.

30
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,400
Not piece of hear!

31
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,780
Indian Ocean,
400 miles east of Madagascar.

32
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,090
But...
the signal went out 10 hours ago!

33
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,880
OK!
Anyone who can tell me...

34
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,830
how we lost the world largest oil tanker...

35
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,830
 wins this price?!

36
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,210
What's the matter?

37
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,900
Our best information puts this
somewhere in the Tramalin ellipse

38
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,200
It's ... abnormality!

39
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,000
It's ... the sailor's nightmare alike!

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,050
- The Bermuda triangle?

41
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:23,200
Disappearance ships navigation area
shrink with the light condition.

42
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,190
Basically every unexplainable
nautical phenomenon out there!

43
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,700
You lost me an explicable!

44
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
Mr. Sinbad,

45
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,100
the pirate just admitted 10 millions dollars.

46
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,580
That's not all, Sir!
They have a bomb!

47
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,440
They have a bomb?

48
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,260
You tell Captain Atash
not engage with them.

49
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,660
We're going to handle this one diplomatically.

50
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,360
- What do you have in mind?
- My ship's on it, Simon.

51
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,000
Can't rule the sea
if you're afraid of water!

52
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,360
Look, Adrian!  I understand that
 you might take it personally.

53
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,890
But you can't decide
what your rationality is!

54
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,590
You're absolutely right!

55
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,290
Thank you, Pat.
You too, Linc.

56
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,890
I'll see both on the air field.

57
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,500
This is 1-3-5!

58
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,420
Running to the occupied in 30 minutes.

59
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,720
Tell whatever you got, Pat!

60
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,750
Ship finds in state of nominal.

61
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,280
Every drop in our control!

62
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,960
Just like the icy of buck cut! Dường như mọi thứ vẫn ở yên,

63
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,310
just fine in every matter!

64
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,210
So what's your plan?

65
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,960
And if that doesn't work?

66
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,400
Move him!

67
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,210
Decode!
Go unlock the guys in system!

68
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
Where are they?

69
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,060
Move him in, ops!

70
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,330
Sir, Madagascar coast guard issued a very storm warning.

71
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,680
Recommend returned a rout!

72
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,700
How far?

73
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,900
20 miles, over flying!
Right on the trace of the vehicle.

74
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,610
Stay in course!

75
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,530
Sir, I am sorry!
We have to abort. </ I>

76
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,600
Move him!

77
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,800
Ship's belonged me.

78
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,960
Put that down!
Put that down!

79
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,210
Put it down!

80
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,880
Put that thing down immediately!

81
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,750
Mayday!  Mayday!
Hell was it up!

82
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,680
Helicopter 426!...
We're going to sink!

83
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,200
Hold on!

84
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,460
Help!

85
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,380
Help!

86
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,700
Crab!

87
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,580
- Adrian!
- Crab!

88
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,230
- Big crab!
- Gemma.
- Adrian!

89
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,120
Gemma.

90
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,800
Did you see that?

91
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,300
- I have some water to take!
- No, a crab that stole my money!

92
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,090
Adrian, you have hallucinated.

93
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,360
Come on, let's take some water.

94
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,850
We've been here for a few hours.

95
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,580
What do you mean "we"?

96
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:44,550
I'm to kill you! playing with our lives!.
You're responsible.

97
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,200
You!

98
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,900
You!

99
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,240
- Here!
- Here?

100
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,840
Lincoln?

101
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,560
We found a few by the crashed helicopter.

102
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,310
We don't want to die soon!

103
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,280
Rescue three of us!.

104
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,020
What about my ship?

105
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,950
It's unclear!.

106
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,550
 Do we mine enough of the Diter hearing package,

107
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,070
But no one goes from the tanker!

108
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,080
Do we know where we are?

109
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,870
The GPS is currently to tracking our coordinate,
but ...

110
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,840
there's nothing!
The middle of the Indian Ocean.

111
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,720
It doesn't seem that this island's here!

112
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,980
Let him go!

113
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,980
- He killed my crewmen,
and attacked my ship.

114
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,980
- The ship with that Captain?

115
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,020
Search plan should be on right now!

116
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,580
We should move to higher ground.

117
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,000
Better chance to signaling one.

118
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,940
Here are up, they don't know where to look!

119
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,700
In the chart of this water, ...

120
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,470
there's no island.

121
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,430
Maybe he knows something.

122
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,770
- Water!
- Not a plenty chance!

123
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:42,940
Captain!

124
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,580
This is the curse.

125
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,870
This island is evil.

126
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,570
We will die here.
All of us.

127
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:21,810
Can't be right!

128
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,670
Seems no survivor!

129
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,920
Mr. Magnus informs the press
accordingly to West oil spilling history.

130
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,870
The good news is:   The blocks of our
bunches of rims are OK.

131
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,880
It's still in holding on to 90% of the cargo.

132
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,060
That's a 130 millions of crude...

133
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,060
... that we can not afford to loose!

134
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,050
We're going to have to save them.

135
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,440
It's too deep for conventional equipment.

136
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:06,190
I want every one of our ships
and every available hands

137
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,570
on that spot!
ASAP!

138
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,860
Mr. Magnus, you don't understand.
That simply isn't the time.

139
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,450
Powers are once lost forever!

140
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,430
But the bullheads will erupt out.

141
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:23,360
- 130 millions gallons!|
The ocean will never be the same again!

142
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,830
How much time do we have?

143
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,670
48 hours max!

144
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,850
Now it seems even stress holders in course of OK.

145
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,800
That's not a sign of function.

146
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,800
The tank's convincible!

147
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,350
I just need to get to it in time.

148
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,430
In time?
Adrian, Acaby is a lost course.

149
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,410
We have to get rid worry about that!

150
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,500
We're getting out of this island.

151
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,620
I'll not allow my
family thing be destroyed!

152
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:48,900
Soundly nice!

153
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,500
- Such a real concern?

154
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,650
- That's my real concern!

155
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,780
In 48 hours, we have a lot to worry about!

156
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,090
What is it?

157
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,800
Phantom.

158
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,260
Ghost of the tree.

159
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,760
Where ...  you from?

160
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,010
We crashed!...

161
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,100
the helicopter.

162
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,720
I am Loa.

163
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,270
Come!

164
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,220
You...

165
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,970
alone...

166
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,770
What is this?

167
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,230
Prophet.

168
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,230
- Unlok eshu.

169
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,370
End.

170
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,910
End of what?

171
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:16,970
Men.

172
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,350
Unless ...

173
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,980
The Seventh.

174
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,780
He ..

175
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,540
The one who save us.

176
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,420
You!

177
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,800
Me?

178
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:14,400
- Look!  I am not ... you think I am.
You must believe.

179
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,630
As I've said,
I am unable to comment

180
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:44,420
on the accuracy of those you see.

181
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,480
Sea ...
Sea rising!

182
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,530
These are is sinking!

183
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,080
Get back!

184
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,030
<i>Geologists are trying to make sense
bizarre  sign makes the phenomenon today...

185
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,740
<i>as dozen of earthquakes occur simultaneously
around the globe.

186
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,700
<i>The tremon was much below
the coastal areas...

187
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,700
 of the most severed along
Indian Ocean sea ports.<i>

188
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:50,300
Mr. Degraves, check the assessment!

189
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,700
Not good!

190
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,290
- This is a blessed!
- I say it again.

191
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:03,080
The seas are cursed!

192
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,620
Low land for a thousand kilometers.

193
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,900
- Shark! ...

194
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,900
- We move the jerk gallop!

195
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,860
Now, do you believe?

196
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,340
The paintings in the cave ...
Where do they come from?

197
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,800
They have always been.
Nor being captive!

198
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,980
Seventh prophercy has begun.

199
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,280
Look!

200
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,820
In the name of God, everyone!
Stay against the wall!

201
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,870
Stay down!
Stay down!

202
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,110
Atack!

203
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,570
He's turning back!
Go!  Go!

204
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,590
Com on! Let's go.

205
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,350
It's not working!
It's too deep.

206
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:02,900
For the last data package reported ...
my position can't get full.

207
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,060
It's starting to fail.

208
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,740
Failure is not an option!

209
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,490
Come on, everybody!
Let's keep moving.

210
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,700
- Here!

211
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,270
Thank you ...

212
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,360
... for your kindness.

213
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:48,110
Your English ... comes better

214
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,080
Come back slowly.

215
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,540
When you're a child?

216
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,000
Yes!
But...

217
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,180
- Many years ago, so I ...
- Say "rusty"!

218
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,150
Yes ... Rusty!

219
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:14,300
In the cave,
you mentioned Unlok eshu.

220
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,930
What does it mean?

221
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:21,520
Unlok eshu ...
no word ...

222
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,690
Like a god,
God of the Sea.

223
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,900
You people ...
poison the ocean ...

224
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,740
poison the world.

225
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,490
Why?

226
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,620
It's complicated.

227
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,290
A terrible anger is coming.

228
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,070
It's there in the prophecy

229
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,890
And you are a center.

230
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:12,010
- It's like judgment stays out there!
- Unbelievable!

231
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,540
By an extra scan of the sea bottom
finely finished win-ward, look!

232
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,950
It's an impact crater.
Big one.

233
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,370
From 10 thousand years ago,
by milky like.

234
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,630
And Akaba, is at the bottom of it.

235
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,260
No!  No! ... No!
This is not hapening.

236
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:40,490
Mr Degraves, grasp your things!
We'll leave.

237
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,650
The Akaba, ... no longer
our responsibility.

238
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:49,090
What are you taling about?
- At 4:00 PM this afternoon,

239
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,710
with my attorney's help,
I have taken this company order.

240
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,700
You won't pull the talking up.
When Mrs, Sinbad find out ...

241
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,120
Current rescue mission had been terminated.

242
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:06,170
Now, ... you coming or not?

243
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,280
No!

244
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,050
What?

245
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,270
I've heard something.

246
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,540
What are you doing?

247
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,880
Hey, come back here!

248
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,980
Rope!

249
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,060
Let's go!

250
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,590
Signal none again!

251
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,180
Papaya, where did you find it?

252
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,640
We need to keep moving.

253
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,680
These stones are where to keep seeing them.

254
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,000
They're everywhere!

255
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,730
The pellet text type!

256
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,750
Large rocks,
created by meteoroid impacts,...

257
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,710
They turnable to calcium.

258
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:26,850
They're usually black, like ascidia.
But these ...

259
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,070
Let's go.

260
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:39,040
That is not a papaya.

261
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,630
What is it?

262
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,920
Death fruit.

263
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:51,140
Now, if anyone can get us
out of this island, then you?

264
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,430
I am still here.

265
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:55,810
- We need to build a draft.
- There is no escape by sea.

266
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,770
These islands are not in fare well.

267
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,310
How did you get here?

268
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,320
I came with my father...

269
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,280
...when I was a child.

270
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,780
He was a very known oceanographer.

271
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,500
Believed there was a Utopia.

272
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,380
We went away in a ballon, find it.

273
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:25,130
But we fell into the sea.

274
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:31,340
And I never saw him again.

275
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:35,470
- Your father was brave.
- My father was mad.

276
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,390
Loa.

277
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:44,520
It's not my destiny to die in this island.

278
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,420
We've been chosen.

279
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,050
For what?

280
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:51,670
Laboring...
and death.

281
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:01,100
- No, when I am still breathing.
- Don't, not looking into the demon's eyes

282
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,030
We wait for darkness.

283
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:44,070
Sinbad.

284
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,230
Take a rest!

285
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:41,710
I am sorry for your friend.

286
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:45,840
She'd better not on the helicopter.

287
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:49,430
Destiny is not written by mankind.

288
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,430
She dependent on me.

289
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:55,690
And I let her down.

290
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:59,060
The nature is dependence.

291
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:02,190
Everything is on everything.

292
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:05,740
Every soul for the earth.

293
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,520
You not see your place in the pattern?

294
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:22,630
Go to the village!

295
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,420
What village?

296
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,510
Be ready for assistance.
Come!

297
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:12,680
- Sea craft survivors.
- No women or children.

298
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:16,580
can't see things to arrive!

299
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:19,560
Ready the Utopia.

300
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:24,980
We just are in solidarity,
on theirs or Father,

301
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,780
to know his concourse.

302
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:30,200
And today,

303
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:32,830
we find those alive,...

304
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:37,000
The progressive from instrusion by outsiders.

305
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:43,210
We must know the glory of this concert.

306
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,090
and what wills for them!

307
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,630
who dare threaten our hearty.

308
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:55,010
upon this un-stoppering soil.

309
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:02,300
Take the prisoners away.
Their sentences awaits to dawn!

310
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,860
- He's my father.
- What?

311
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:13,870
He's my father.

312
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,260
Who are these people?

313
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:42,230
Lincoln?

314
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:50,240
- After we come ... dealt in the fired,... lank!

315
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:51,950
The stones...

316
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:53,950
It's me, Adrian.

317
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,530
- Mr. Sinbad?
- Yes.

318
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:03,330
Have ever heard a way off the island?

319
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:06,670
Oh, yes!  It's the way on.

320
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:11,800
I heard the guards saying:
Demon in the fire,...

321
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:14,050
The stones...

322
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,760
The stones ...

323
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:19,850
Why wouldn't you believe me?

324
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,310
Lincoln!

325
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:37,740
I believe you.

326
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:54,200
<i>Dozen of major earthquakes... </i>

327
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,400
<i> ...from all of nations today
are gone through. </i>

328
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:00,390
<i>Middle East, Africa, Central Asia
and America, </i>

329
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:02,890
<i>All reported bad damages and casualties... </i>

330
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:06,940
<i>It was religion supporting
the beginning of the apocalypse.</i>

331
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:10,400
<i>While the scientific community
has refused such claim,</i>

332
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,570
<i>they remain unable to saving lives in....</i>

333
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,490
The elevator are broken,

334
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,320
Stairway is blocked.

335
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:28,830
Brother decree, now the prisoners
be ready for the contest.

336
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:35,380
Only one can be warranted
the privilege of joining us...

337
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:39,260
as brother.
And so, these three...

338
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,440
... will engage in all fenced combat.

339
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:44,140
to their death.

340
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:49,310
Bring forth the pirate!

341
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:55,400
Who wants challenge him?

342
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,240
Don't do it, Captain!

343
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:11,960
I never saw such a highly challenge.

344
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:31,060
You pick, toward!

345
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,640
The challenge we hold up for!

346
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:19,150
Finish him!
Kill!  Kill!  ...

347
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:33,630
I apology!

348
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:36,170
You did fight like a gentleman!

349
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:39,030
You fight like a pregnant dog.

350
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:44,970
No!

351
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:53,650
No!

352
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:00,350
Hey!

353
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,780
Get ready for this work after all!

354
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,580
If there was a radio, would you go?

355
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,150
Or stay here in your Utopia?

356
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:17,250
Fight or die!

357
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:20,920
I don't think you realize settle man
just snaps anything fits his interested mind by his own.

358
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:25,900
Otherwise he wouldn't kill the chief prisoner
who could get you off this island.

359
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:30,850
I have the stones.

360
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:37,440
Demon in fire?

361
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,110
- Don't listen to him.
- I have the stones.

362
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:48,080
Friends!
You're all to see!

363
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:50,810
and following a false prophet.

364
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:55,080
Join me!
And I make you one promise...

365
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:57,400
... to lead you off this island.

366
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:01,400
Brothers, you forget yourself.

367
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,090
And is start doing
forsake your father.

368
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,220
- I have the stones!

369
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:09,680
- Let me lead you!
- Enough!

370
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:32,550
No, no, no!

371
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:36,190
- I will bring you back there.
- My work is done.

372
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,060
I will die with honor.

373
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:44,020
Go!
Go!

374
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,300
Dady?

375
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,140
Daddy?

376
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:18,930
Loa.

377
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,360
- I thought you're gone.
- I am here, Daddy!

378
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:32,670
I've been very ill.

379
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:36,130
I would never take you with me.

380
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:44,060
- Loa.
- Stones ...

381
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:48,750
Stones from the vacano ...
They're not of the earth.

382
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:53,080
They're the only way off this island.

383
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:06,230
The faithful rise again.

384
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,360
No!

385
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:13,620
- Go, go!.
- No! ...

386
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:52,150
Gemma's math has taken down
to this couple of hours.

387
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:57,330
- I'm sure open to believe your father!
- My father tells the truth.

388
00:58:58,610 --> 00:58:59,870
I know him!

389
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:01,250
So the whole village.

390
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,600
- He came back to me.
I saw it!

391
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:08,130
- He's sick, Loa!

392
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,450
Look!

393
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,840
Then blow dynamite!

394
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,590
- No!
- And don't argue!

395
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,950
- Don't make me kill you!
- Don't tell me what to do!

396
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:06,020
- OK?
- OK!

397
01:00:08,590 --> 01:00:10,190
Need anything else?

398
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:25,570
Loa! Loa!

399
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,740
Loa!
Pull me up!

400
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:00,530
Loa!

401
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,320
Loa, blow it!

402
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:12,950
Loa!

403
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,050
- How did you?
- Fire escape.

404
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:43,800
Daddy?

405
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,140
Daddy?

406
01:04:56,490 --> 01:04:57,850
My daughter.

407
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:07,320
Stones ...

408
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,460
- Sphinx ...
- I'm getting you with me.

409
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:28,920
Loa, forgive me!

410
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:35,850
I forgive, father.

411
01:06:55,850 --> 01:06:59,460
The win's taking us sea,
over the Indian Ocean.

412
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:02,980
If we're lucky,
we'll cross shipping lanes.

413
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,500
If not?

414
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:48,520
Loa!

415
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:50,860
Loa, a ship!
It's a ship!

416
01:08:05,370 --> 01:08:06,670
Sindbad.

417
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:46,290
Loa.

418
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,210
Loa!

419
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:52,530
Loa.

420
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:05,470
Loa!

421
01:09:18,610 --> 01:09:24,820
<i>The sky will spread by an off order.
The evidence are open, and cycling around the globe.</i>

422
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:27,620
<i>Everywhere on this earth
the signs are huge!</i>

423
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,080
<i>The signs of the coming of the end,
 </i>

424
01:09:30,180 --> 01:09:35,330
<i>...the earth ...</i>

425
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:40,550
- Loa.
<i>The non believers will be punished. </i>

426
01:09:46,170 --> 01:09:48,200
- Where is she?
- There's no one here!

427
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:50,620
Where is she?

428
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:52,620
Woudn't it matter?
We're going to die anyway!

429
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:55,100
- Where is she?
Hey!  Hey!

430
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:58,440
Loa! Loa!

431
01:09:59,350 --> 01:10:01,370
<i>The evil will be punished. </i>

432
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:05,400
<i>The end is polar.
It is the total destruction!</i>

433
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,400
<i>The believers will be honored ...</i>

434
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:34,670
<i>How many on over....</i>

435
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:36,020
There's someone in the water.

436
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:48,160
I think I've lost you.

437
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:51,540
It's all my fault.

438
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:56,040
What can I do?

439
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,250
- What can I do?

440
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,750
The paintings are about the earth.

441
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:07,600
- There'd been six.

442
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:11,040
Tanker!

443
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,310
- It's the tanker.

444
01:11:33,770 --> 01:11:37,790
You know, Alex,
you're good people, loyal.

445
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:41,520
We get out of this,

446
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,420
I am personally going to make sure

447
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:45,760
that you'll be well taken care.

448
01:11:46,430 --> 01:11:47,970
Here, have a drink!

449
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:51,270
For a while!

450
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:12,840
I leave for 5 years to live at this place!

451
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:29,050
We're calling it the Tromlin's crater.

452
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:34,500
It is 4 miles deep. The Akaba power
can't be more than 5 to 6%.

453
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,590
When the first bullhead erupts out,

454
01:12:36,590 --> 01:12:38,590
the rest will go down like domino.

455
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:40,480
What do these lines explain?

456
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:44,320
These are fields of mineral depostis
picked up by multi-beam ultrasound.

457
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,030
Buried...
100 meters beneath the sea bottom.

458
01:12:47,390 --> 01:12:50,600
Geomorphology suggests they
came as the meteoritic from the crater;

459
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,500
but ...

460
01:12:51,730 --> 01:12:55,460
the signature ... 
I've never seen anything like that.

461
01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:03,540
I drive C-130 dive down deep,
empty a place for cargo.

462
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:05,840
What craft, though?

463
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:07,880
The Pytheas.

464
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:10,340
I'm raising the tanker.

465
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:13,050
How remove of some floatings on line?

466
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:15,390
How's it even been tested at the kind of depth?

467
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:16,700
- I'm aware of the risk.

468
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:20,900
But don't you respect, Sir.
You're not even trained in that operation?

469
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:23,070
That's why you're going to
talk to me to it up here.

470
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:25,680
Our com. network is decimated.

471
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,360
- Improvise.

472
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:30,570
Even if I could, the tanker
is nearly milion tons of deadth weight!

473
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:35,120
How can you come to the expect to
lift it through 4 miles of water, Sir?

474
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:37,100
It's a suicide mission!

475
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:39,100
Not I'm asking for any volunteer!

476
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:41,580
But you'll need one.

477
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:44,630
Because the Pytheas requires two operators.

478
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:51,220
<i>Our brakes on line. </ I>

479
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:53,600
<i>Our trans submission nominal. </ I>

480
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:53,900
<i>Our tearing cross is checked! </ I>

481
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:58,730
<i>Escalate the hydrolic propeller allowed.
Take a lay in arm, go! </ I>

482
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,500
Vital screen in costa board.

483
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,330
Stand by first swimming lesson!

484
01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:06,110
- Where's Simon, Is he there?
- I am here.

485
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:08,150
I know what you did, Simon.

486
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:11,740
Under any circumstance,
you'll be fired!

487
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:13,030
You're lucky!
I need you right now.

488
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:18,420
Better know expensive clean up!  I don't care if
you can or can't or let me know! Do you Understand?

489
01:14:21,230 --> 01:14:22,900
- Degraves, you're ready?
- Controls - ready, Sir.

490
01:14:23,810 --> 01:14:25,410
Activating automated navigation!

491
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:29,500
Decoupling setters - 3, 2, 1!

492
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,800
Merge!

493
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:37,440
- The craft is in your hand, Captain!

494
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:39,300
- Captain,

495
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:41,580
You have a seat to his left.

496

<i>Depth 1000 feet. </ I>

497

<i>Power cells are at 92%.
Not bad, Captain! </ I>

498
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:55,070
- Seem a natural!

499
01:14:58,440 --> 01:14:59,580
Degraves.

01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:02,580
Detecting an oil leak
on turbine transfer comes to seal No 7.

501
01:15:03,850 --> 01:15:06,480
Eliminating what you buttoned
to have on your hold, hold now!

502
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,080
I you see, Loa!

503
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,790
Only a mile down and already quick!

504
01:15:13,690 --> 01:15:16,430
Sir, I want you to keep an eye on depth at all times.

505
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:19,580
A seal record cracked at 20 thousand feet. 
Stay not!

506
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:21,840
Stay not! ... I repeat,
Stay not any deeper!

507
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,520
Twelve thousands.
5 kilometers </ i>

508
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,150
Can't see them here, Captain!

509
01:16:02,150 --> 01:16:04,150
Can't see them up here, Loa!

510
01:16:06,990 --> 01:16:08,230
Loa?

511
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:14,280
- We'll try to stablize it.
- I can't. We stay out of control!

512
01:16:15,610 --> 01:16:17,070
- So try the turbines.

513
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,200
- What the hell is that?

514
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:27,750
- I don't think I want to know.
- Take it easy, we'll try the full contact!

515
01:16:29,190 --> 01:16:31,800
The power is down to 61%. It's running too hot. .

516
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:34,360
I'm going to see if
I can abbreviate the vital supporting.

517
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:37,630
- Control the Pytheas.
- Degraves.

518

- Degraves.
- Where is my plug-in server?

519
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,810
What did I miss?

520
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:48,200
Com. link just pukes.

521
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,050
Tecko data was down.

522
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:51,690
Too deep for radio.

523
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:53,400
Meaning what?

524
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:03,080
OK!

525
01:17:06,410 --> 01:17:07,500
We'll do it on our own!

526
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:22,970
Oh, God!

527
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:24,680
[Auxiliary power:  0%]

528

This is just start!

532
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:56,380
Unlok eshu.

533
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,070
The first bullhead!

534
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,180
Beweging sensor!

535
01:18:33,550 --> 01:18:34,720
It can't be right!

536
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:36,720
Failed fucking piece,
several miles to go!

537

Three...
Two...
One.

538
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:20,550
Hang on!

539
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:29,770
Now, the arms!

540
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:26,450
Why didn't he kill us?

541
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:29,620
He's mysterious!

542
01:20:33,330 --> 01:20:34,830
Switch our seats.

543
01:20:49,870 --> 01:20:51,680
- Sindbad, No! ...
- Wait!

544

This is my ship.

550
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:45,420
- Sinbad!
- I know, I start to drill.

551

I'm to use all the power

Come?

- The tanker?
