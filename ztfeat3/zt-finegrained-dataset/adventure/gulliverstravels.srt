1
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,085
"Give me your
Press badge! "

2
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:10,170
"No way.
You're not my dad! "

3
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,215
"Then I shall take it
by force! "

4
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:14,675
"Oh...
he's my brother!"

5
00:02:14,675 --> 00:02:16,760
"So shall make out
with her. "

6
00:03:06,393 --> 00:03:08,103
<i> So your name is Dan </ i></i>

7
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:11,940
Yes Dan Quinn.
Like on the resume.

8
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,944
Dan Quinn, born in 1990.
Didn't think that was possible.

9
00:03:15,944 --> 00:03:20,866
Yes, 1990.
People are born every year.

10
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:23,535
What do you hope to get out
from being in the Mailroom, Dan?

11
00:03:23,535 --> 00:03:27,289
I guess I hope to get out
of 'being' in the Mailroom.

12
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:30,668
You got 'Saz'.
I like it.

13
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:33,837
Guess what?
You're hired.

14
00:03:33,837 --> 00:03:36,715
I'm Lemuel Gulliver.
Welcome to the team!

15
00:03:36,715 --> 00:03:41,095
I was hired yesterday
by the HR.

16
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:44,431
What?
-"Doggie wants a bone".

17
00:03:45,474 --> 00:03:49,687
Floor 30. This is the Editor's floor.
-We're at the epicenter, my friend.

18
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,189
Feel it! Feel it!
-Ok.

19
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:53,982
Oh, we've got a little
something for you.

20
00:03:53,982 --> 00:03:56,443
Oh, damn it! Sorry about that!
Listen, I will try clean that. Sorry!

21
00:03:56,443 --> 00:03:59,029
Sorry about that.
'Bye.

22
00:03:59,029 --> 00:04:00,989
Just wait a minute.
-Huh?

23
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:02,700
One second.

24
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:06,453
It's your mail, sir.

25
00:04:06,453 --> 00:04:09,456
Hey, you're Herald Jones, right?
-Yes.

26
00:04:09,456 --> 00:04:12,626
I love your piece on
"the failures and dreams
of the markets".

27
00:04:12,626 --> 00:04:15,671
Thanks very much.
Look forward to seeing
you around.

28
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:20,551
And you've been
an inspiration to all
the readers.

29
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:23,595
Dan, what are you doing?
You CAN'T talk to those guys!

30
00:04:23,595 --> 00:04:25,055
Why not?
-Because, okay...

31
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:28,225
...this is your first day.
We're the Mailroom guys.

32
00:04:28,225 --> 00:04:30,227
Mailroom guys are meant
to be seen and not heard.

33
00:04:30,227 --> 00:04:31,979
And ideally,
not even seen!

34
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,023
We are not at their level.
We are little people.

35
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,316
You know what it is?
I think you're just scared
talk to them.

36
00:04:36,358 --> 00:04:39,820
I'm not! Listen,
I'm just respectful of
their workspace.

37
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,781
I talk with these people
all the time...

38
00:04:48,912 --> 00:04:51,915
Thanks, I'll let you
know once I made a decision,
Nigel.

39
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:53,417
Thanks you.
-Thank you.

40
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:55,794
Good day, fellas!
-Good day mate!

41
00:04:55,794 --> 00:04:58,005
Gulliver!
Got any mail for me?

42
00:04:58,005 --> 00:05:01,342
Yeah .. No. Maybe.
Let me check.

43
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,761
Hi, I'm Dan...
from the Mailroom.
-Darcy.

44
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,889
I will do whatever it takes
to "not" be from the Mailroom.

45
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,933
Doesn't really need to
bother her right now,
she's busy.

46
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:12,853
You're not really bothering me.
I love every reason to procrastinate.

47
00:05:12,853 --> 00:05:15,606
Yes, me too.
You're not bugging me.

48
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,733
Right, oh, wow...

49
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:20,277
I'll see you guys later.
-Ok, good to see you!

50
00:05:20,277 --> 00:05:22,863
Let's go!

51
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,243
So, how long did you have
that debilitating crush on the
'travel letter'?

52
00:05:28,243 --> 00:05:30,537
Crush on Darcy?
No way, dude.

53
00:05:30,537 --> 00:05:32,206
Ok, first of all,
you're a terrible liar.

54
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,416
Second of all,
Why didn't you just
ask her out?

55
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,460
Oh, you don't think that
I'm gonna ask her out?
-No.

56
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,379
Dude, I'm gonna ask her out
"whenever" or "wherever"...

57
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,130
... no problem, It just
take me 5 seconds.

58
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,091
"Will you go out with me?"
"Yes"... done!

59
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,093
I'm not going out with
Darcy Silverman.

60
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,095
We're "boyfriend, girlfriend"
"You know Gulliver and Darcy?"

61
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,097
"Yes, they're the cutest
couple ever!"
-Ok, so...

62
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,432
...really do it!

63
00:05:50,432 --> 00:05:52,184
The next time I see her,
I will!

64
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:53,519
Hold on!

65
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,896
"Hi, again.
"Oh, hi, Darcy!

66
00:05:55,896 --> 00:05:59,233
I just remembered...
I get claustrophobia
in elevators.

67
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:08,909
How is your day going?
-Really good.

68
00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:10,327
It's going really good.

69
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:15,624
What are you doing this weekend?
-So much... that I've just got to do a...

70
00:06:15,624 --> 00:06:18,627
...bunch of stuff. -Cool.
-Yeah, it's cool!

71
00:06:23,507 --> 00:06:25,926
Have a good one!
-You too!

72
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,892
Wait! I forgot something.
-Yeah, me too.

73
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,907
Gul.

74
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:51,994
Yeah?
-Yeaaah!

75
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,996
You chickened out,
didn't you?

76
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:58,000
Listen... I just... you know....
I didn't chicken out.

77
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,544
You're being respectful
of her workspace.
-Exactly.

78
00:07:00,544 --> 00:07:05,090
Dude, speaking of which,
after work, do you want to go
for a couple of brews...

79
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,260
...shoot some pools,
maybe a little man date,
huh?

80
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,472
I don't think so. Especially
if it's called a 'man date',
sir...

81
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,265
I got you!
You want a 'rain cheque'.

82
00:07:13,265 --> 00:07:17,311
You want to wake up all 'bright-eyed'
and 'bushy-tailed' for the boss.

83
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:21,148
You are not my boss anymore.
-What're you talkin' about?

84
00:07:21,148 --> 00:07:23,817
I just got promoted.

85
00:07:23,817 --> 00:07:26,320
It's impossible!
You just got here.

86
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,616
Yeah, they promoted me
to the 'head' of the Mailroom.

87
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,869
So, I'm your boss now.

88
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:39,625
Look, Gulliver,
the reason you didn't
ask her out...

89
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,462
...and you never will,
is the same reason you're
not going to leave the Mailroom.

90
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:46,256
You've been here like
ten years, man.

91
00:07:47,257 --> 00:07:49,343
You know, you ...

92
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,178
You peaked.

93
00:07:51,178 --> 00:07:55,557
When you talk the big game,
and that could be fun
...sometimes.

94
00:07:55,557 --> 00:07:57,726
And you're pretty funny
around the office...

95
00:07:57,726 --> 00:08:00,562
...but that's all you are.
just 'talk'.

96
00:08:00,562 --> 00:08:05,275
So, you might as well face it.
You're never really going to get any
bigger than this.

97
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:13,117
These talks is...
the worst part of being a boss.

98
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:17,538
Anyway, be in tomorrow at 7am.
We're gonna sort of change
things up and...

99
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:21,333
...let's start with playing the guitar
during working hours.

100
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:35,264
Good night, Darcy!
See ya!

101
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,281
Gulliver?

102
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,827
Hi.
Hi.

103
00:08:56,827 --> 00:09:00,497
Can I help you?
-Yeah, I. ..

104
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:05,461
Well, I wanted to see
if ...

105
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,379
you wanted to...

106
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:13,093
You seem a little nervous.
Are you alright?

107
00:09:13,093 --> 00:09:17,431
I'm fine. I'm just...
I've got so much going on...

108
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,641
I wanted to pick this up,
and then I was on my way.

109
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:22,936
You want to apply for a
'travel writing summit'?

110
00:09:24,521 --> 00:09:26,482
Yup, exactly.

111
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,318
I had no idea you wrote,
or travel.

112
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:32,112
I do, I travel a lot.
I go to New Zealand...

113
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:36,575
...been to Mexico,
"me-hee-kaw" as they called it,
the locals.

114
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:38,911
Africa, the Congo...

115
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:43,207
...which I know is in Africa
because I 'travel' and 'write'.

116
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,834
So, this is kind of like
what I want to do.

117
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:49,838
Why don't you bring in a
writing sample tomorrow morning
and I'll see what I can do.

118
00:09:49,838 --> 00:09:52,007
Perfect.

119
00:09:52,007 --> 00:09:54,009
Okay.

120
00:09:55,135 --> 00:09:56,679
Hey, Gulliver!

121
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,139
Nice job
putting yourself up for it.

122
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:03,102
Yeah, cool. Okay, bye-bye.
-Bye-bye!

123
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,282
Gulliver's Travels

124
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,037
Jesus! I meant to ask
her out...

125
00:10:22,037 --> 00:10:24,665
Now she's expecting a writing sample?
What was I thinking?!!!

126
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:28,335
<i>I saw some things
in different lands </ i></i>

127
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:37,553
I got to write this thing!

128
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:41,473
No, I've got nothing.

129
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:49,440
Oaxaca, MEXICO

130
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:16,342
Wow! I'm so impressed, Gulliver.
I had no idea that you're such
a good writer.

131
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,344
Well, I tried to
keep it a secret...

132
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,347
I don't like to brag
about my more literarian side.

133
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,558
These samples are terrific,
and you exhibit such variety.

134
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,269
I mean, this one about Oaxaca
feels really classic.

135
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,813
Like it's straight out
of 'Frommer's'...

136
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:32,775
...where a description of Barcelona
is all sassy!

137
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,778
It's like I'm reading
'Time Out'!

138
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:40,616
I think I've the perfect fluff piece
to start you off with!

139
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:44,161
There's a guy down in Bermuda
who claims he has the secret
to the Bermuda Triangle.

140
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,372
He's either crazy or
he's trying to build...

141
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,625
But I figure it could be
a fun way in...

142
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,211
...to explore Bermuda
and the small islands
around it, you know.

143
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,213
You have boat experience,
don't you?

144
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:58,801
I'm... I'm a...
I'm a 'boat' man.

145
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,804
Okay, good,
'cos...

146
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,806
I've to be honest with you...
It's hard for me to find
someone to do this.

147
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,975
You have to be at sea
for 3 weeks, completely
off the grid.

148
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:08,394
That's okay with you,
right?

149
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,604
Good, 'cos I thought I was going
to have to do it and...

150
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,564
...I do get 'super' sea sick.

151
00:12:12,564 --> 00:12:14,858
Crazy!.
-Yeah.

152
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:17,152
What do you say?
Not a big story...

153
00:12:17,152 --> 00:12:19,947
...but it's a start.

154
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,035
Okay, so the
Bermuda Triangle, huh?.

155
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:28,914
And everything I need to know is in here?
-It is. Your contact has been arranged.

156
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,834
And there's a boat
waiting for you.

157
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,585
Yeah!

158
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,439
Oh, hey!
That's me!

159
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,442
<i> Precious cargo!.
No! No! Hoo... Ok! </ i></i>

160
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,570
That was close.

161
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,948
All the chickens get off
the road, man!.

162
00:13:04,908 --> 00:13:08,746
I don't know about this, Hank.
I mean, are you sure this is safe?

163
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,706
All this
Bermuda Triangle talk...

164
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,583
...is just to sell
T-shirts to tourists.

165
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:16,837
It's a good story
to pick up some girls.

166
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,756
This is your boat.

167
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:22,134
"KnotferSail"
They really went 'Pun-tastic'
on that boat.

168
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:26,555
Well, the Dock Master's
really into pun, man. He believes it
keeps the pirates away.

169
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,183
"Ship Happens."

170
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,727
This is 'you'.
And that's your 'destination'.

171
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,772
Just follow that 'dot'
and you'll find yourself
in the 'Triangle'.

172
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,315
In the Bermuda Triangle?
-Yeah!

173
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,985
And then to come home, you said,
I turn this knob and follow
the 'dot' back home?

174
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,279
Yes!
-Easy!

175
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,614
Done!
-Done!

176
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,407
All right.
-I got it.

177
00:13:47,534 --> 00:13:49,620
Fine, fine!

178
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,997
Well ..

179
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,582
It's not moving.

180
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,710
Okay.
Where is the clutch?

181
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:05,052
<i> And as you go out,
to the ocean water... </ i></i>

182
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:09,139
<i> ...towards the Bermuda Triangle,
there're reflections everywhere. </ i></i>

183
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,266
I should have brought
sunglasses.

184
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:14,478
I'm as hungry
as a horse.

185
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:17,022
I could eat a thousand
cheeseburgers.

186
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,484
Okay, 'quitting' time.

187
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,240
Yeah!

188
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,160
How to build
your own robot.

189
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,204
That's going to happen!

190
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,146
Darcy.

191
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,066
Cheeseburger.

192
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,611
Darcy.

193
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,823
<i> Cheeseburger. </ i></i>

194
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,360
Safety! Okay.

195
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,613
Rubber ducky. No!
Floaties!

196
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,573
For the legs,
for the arms...

197
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,867
...for the head!

198
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,869
I am safe!

199
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,002
911! Gotcha!
Oh, no!

200
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,497
I'm paralyzed
from the neck down.

201
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,207
What is that
crawling on me?

202
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:44,753
No, no, not fire ants!
Please don't be... fire ants.

203
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:50,092
I am General Edward Edwardian,
Commander of Lilliput.

204
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:53,012
<i> All hail, Liliput!
All hail Liliput! </ I></i>

205
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:57,808
"You are herewith charged
with aiding our sworn enemy,
the Blefuscu!"

206
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:02,021
"You are our prisoner
and shall be presented
to our Royal Highness...

207
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,898
...King Theodore!
What say you, Beast?!!

208
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:31,925
You are not real!
Where am I?
Where am I?

209
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,011
I'm dreaming.
I'm going to close my eyes...

210
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,388
...and then I'm going to open them
and I'll be home in bed.

211
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,933
Okay! Okay!.

212
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,061
My spear.

213
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,608
Bring the Beast down!

214
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,486
Alright, boys!
Release the hookers!

215
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,030
Pull! Pull!

216
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,284
Pull!
-That's not cool!

217
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,663
Hey! That's my pants.
That's not funny!

218
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,670
Unlucky!

219
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,100
Pull!

220
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:26,063
Pull!

221
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,233
Lift!

222
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,654
Rest!

223
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:20,868
This Giant is hereby declared to
be brought to His Majesty, King Theodore!

224
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:26,206
<i>All hail King Theodore!
All hail King Theodore! </ i></i>

225
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,672
I wanted a bracelet...

226
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,759
...not a great,
big hairy Beast!

227
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:42,973
Oh, dear...
are these strings
really necessary?

228
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:46,268
They are...
My innocent, naive,
little 'Bunny tail'.

229
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,772
To prevent the giant Beast
from running rampant and
killing us all!

230
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,191
What is this thing?
-A Blefuscian spy.

231
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,361
I am not a 'Blefuscian'.
I don't even know what that is.

232
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,905
Someone please,
just tell me where I am?

233
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,908
You're in Lilliput!
-Liliput?

234
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:04,286
The grandest and greatest
land in all the world!

235
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,914
<i>All hail Lilliput!
All hail Lilliput!</ i></i>

236
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,415
This is insane!

237
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,335
This is insane!
Okay, enough!

238
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,754
Come out with
the funny cameras!

239
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,400
<i>Mealtime, Beast! </ i></i>

240
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,490
Hay?
I can't eat hay!

241
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,201
Eat up!
You've a busy day ahead
of you, Beast!

242
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,577
Enough with
the 'Beast' thing!

243
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,913
I may be a giant
but I have feelings!!!

244
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,335
I think that you will find
that the hay is...

245
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:57,715
...a bit more digestible if
mixed with some sewer water.

246
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,677
I am sorry my countrymen
called you a 'Beast'.

247
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,388
I do not think of you as a 'Beast'.
As a matter of fact...

248
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:09,226
...before you arrived, I was
the tallest man in the Lilliput.

249
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:13,022
So, I know how you feel.
-Thanks, man.

250
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,654
I can't reach you for a
handshake. I am Gulliver.

251
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,406
Horatio.

252
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,118
You guys are so tiny.

253
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,454
Are you the only prisoner
in the whole dungeon?

254
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:33,625
Yes, I've been placed in
this prison by the great and glorious
general Edward Edwardian...

255
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:37,004
...for sending an illicit
letter to his betrothed...

256
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,589
...Princess Mary.

257
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:42,468
That's it? He put you in prison
for hitting on his lady?

258
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,927
Dude, that is harsh!

259
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:47,639
No, no, no, you must understand
that I am of a lowly station.

260
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,559
To legally court
a woman of her stature...

261
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,644
...one must commit a
valued action...

262
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,397
...which is virtually impossible
as a commoner.

263
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,734
Come on, don't be so hard on yourself.
You seem like a cool guy.

264
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,402
You can do something valiant!

265
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,905
Gen. Edward has led
countless crusades...

266
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:05,240
and is known far and wide
for his bravery.

267
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,368
I'm no Gen. Edward.

268
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:08,744
Well ..

269
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:12,623
No offense, but this Edward guy,
seems like kind of a lame-ass.

270
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,458
A lame what?

271
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:19,380
It's my impression that 'lame-ass'...

272
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,174
...is a negative expression
from whence you came.

273
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,678
If this is the case,
you should be thrown
into stocks!

274
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,054
No, no!

275
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:30,683
"Lame-ass" means,
'great, brave...

276
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:34,311
...courageous, heart of
a lion' man.

277
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:38,524
Is this the honorable truth?
Yes, this is the honorable truth.

278
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:41,860
Then, I'm not just
a 'lame-ass'.

279
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,237
No.

280
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:45,656
I'm a big 'lame-ass'!
-The biggest!

281
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:49,159
I, General Edward Edwardian,
I'm the biggest 'lame-ass'
in all of the land!

282
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,036
Heart of the lion!

283
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,373
So, listen...
now you know that
we're cool...

284
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,751
What do say if you
loosen up these
shackles a bit?

285
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:03,799
No. It's time for your life
of hard labor to begin.

286
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,676
<i> Left </ i></i>

Their Defense System
is operational.

292
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,989
We must move in
stealthily.

<i> Left </ i></i>

294
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:38,667
Did I tell you to stop
fanning, peasant?!!
-Sorry.

295
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,925
They would be too busy with the fire
to protect their Princess.

296
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:57,311
Fire!
Fire is 2 bells. There was 3.

297
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:58,687
It is an attack!

298
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:02,649
There were more than 2 bells and
a pause, then a third bell.

299
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,276
So, there is an attack
and a fire?

300
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,570
The Blefuscians!
-The Princess!

301
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,614
To the Castle, Beast!

302
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:11,575
Left, right!

303
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,369
Faster, Beast!

304
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,961
Oh, no! The Blefuscians!

305
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:26,298
Do not kidnap me!
Please do not kidnap me!

306
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,841
Why is she standing there?

307
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:31,929
First, she's going to get
kidnapped and...
-You speak not of the Princess!

308
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:33,597
Down!

309
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,643
I shall save you,
my Princess!

310
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,645
'My Princess'.

311
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,067
Dude, I can help!

312
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,194
We do not need your help,
Beast.

313
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,821
You just stay here!

314
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,907
Nobody save
the Princess!

315
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,575
He'll never get
to her in time!

316
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,536
Please, you must
save the Princess!

317
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:58,497
Yeah, but you heard that
angry little dingleberry,
he said I shouldn't!

318
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,124
I beg of you!

319
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:10,175
It's too late.
-You're kidnapped!

320
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,678
I am kidnapped!
-Not on my watch!

321
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:24,648
Hop on, Princess.
Let's get you out of here.

322
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:30,696
Fear not, darling!
I am here to save you!

323
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:33,157
Where did she go?

324
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:36,410
Oh... She has been
kidnapped.

325
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,999
Here you go, Princess.
-Thank you so much!

326
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:44,877
Are you okay?
-Yes.

327
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,588
Thank God.

328
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:54,261
The Blefuscians have retreated.
-We ought to have a victory feast!

329
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,472
Terrific!

330
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:59,933
The fire has raised out of control.
-My father is trapped!

331
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:03,270
You guys got to invest
in a more efficient warning system!

332
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:06,231
Your Highness!

333
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,111
Out of the way!
I've gotta put out the fire!

334
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,155
Out of the way...
Coming through!

335
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,201
The Beast!

336
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:22,414
Yeoow! I've gotta say
that was hot!!!

337
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,500
Princess, no!

338
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,170
Princess... no... you mustn't!
-Father! He's burning!

339
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,589
You have served me
with great honor!

340
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,677
We need access to a great
deal of water!
-Do something!

341
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,474
I do not want to do this.

342
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:43,894
You have a plan?!
-I have a plan but you're
not going to like it.

343
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,316
Don't look.

344
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,785
Seize Beast!

345
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,745
It's working!

346
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,956
Yes it is working!

347
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,290
Out of the way!

348
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:09,169
How dare you evacuate yourself
on our great and glorious...

349
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,135
Oh no... Oh no.
Sorry about that smell.

350
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:19,972
I have been drinking sewer water.
-This is ground for execution!

351
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:23,684
I know that was pretty gross.
Let me pull up my trousers.

352
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:27,104
Father! Father!

353
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,649
You look glorious!

354
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,945
Thank you my dear.

355
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:48,500
Our Savior, the Beast!

356
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,963
Beast! Beast! Beast!
Beast! Beast! Beast!

357
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:55,382
Hey, guys...
It was nothing, really.

358
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:59,053
I saw a fire, I had some water
and released flood on 'I-O-2'
(Instant-On Input-Output).

359
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:02,431
Is that translated?

360
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:05,601
You got the joke here?
'Flood on I-O-2'?

361
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,604
Ok, Thanks to you guys.

362
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:19,573
The King requests the honor
of your company at the banquet
this evening...

363
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:23,577
Do you accept?
-Yeah, on one condition.

364
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:27,206
You free my friend Horatio,
and allow me to bring him
as my 'Plus One'.

365
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:31,543
He was jailed for 'unlawful'
courting. He must return...

366
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,588
That's my condish!

367
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,840
One moment,
if you will.

368
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,471
Why are you doing
this for me?

369
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:45,474
Because you are my buddy.
I'm not going to this thing
without you.

370
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:48,060
I'm not going to know
anybody there.
You have to come!

371
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,895
Shhh...
Play it cool.

372
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,190
The King requests the honor
of your...

373
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,403
...and Horatio's company
at the Royal banquet
this evening.

374
00:28:57,403 --> 00:29:00,948
Do you accept?
-Yes indeed.

375
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:03,409
I can make it.
-Oh, God...

376
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:09,206
My God!
I'm forever indebted to you.

377
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:12,584
It's not necessary.
Instead, let's just do this.

378
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:17,047
What is that?
-You pound it...
with your fist.

379
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:19,425
Come on,
don't let me hangin'.

380
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:24,680
Yeah!
Now, let's go P-A-R-T-Y...
Yeaaaah!

381
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:39,236
Will not somebody ...
I'll eat everything.

382
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:58,172
So, since you are not from Blefuscia,
where are you from?

383
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:01,175
Beast?

384
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:04,011
Once again, totally cool
to be just called Gulliver.

385
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:08,807
Some people believe that
you've come from the island
that we dare not go.

386
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,477
Is there any truth
to this rumor?

387
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:14,646
No. Where is
"The island that we
dare not go"?

388
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:19,443
There, beyond the fog bank.

389
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:23,030
Nuh, I didn't come from the fog bank.
I'm from the island of Manhattan.

390
00:30:23,072 --> 00:30:26,700
Between the islands of
Staten and Long.

391
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,537
This island of Manhattan?
What sort of 'Kingdom' is it?

392
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:34,124
I'm not from a 'Kingdom'.
I'm actually from a democracy.

393
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:37,628
You see, we elect
a president
every 4 years.

394
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:40,964
You're so honorable
and courageous.

395
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:44,802
Were you the President?
-Of course he was, Mother!

396
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:48,222
Look at him.
He's the most powerful
gentleman in all the land.

397
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:50,099
So sorry mother
embarrassed you.

398
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:54,186
No, no, it's a common mistake
to not think I was President.

399
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,355
Are you a victorious President?

400
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,565
Oh, yeah, pretty victorious

401
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,819
Noble as well?
Yeah, I was eh...

402
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:03,195
... Super noble.

403
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:08,117
I was actually known
as 'President the Awesome'.

404
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:10,536
'President the Awesome'.

405
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:14,373
Pretty unlikely title.

406
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:18,127
When do you return home,
noble and awesome Gulliver?

407
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:20,838
Pretty soon,
I suppose, yes?

408
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:23,340
I should imagine they're
falling apart without you.

409
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,551
Their 'greatest' hero.

410
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:29,888
Well, without my boat...
looks like I'm stuck here.

411
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,391
Don't worry, my army
will find your boat.

412
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:34,852
At the meantime, I'm sure
we could find you a
suitable accommodation.

413
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:36,478
You mean...
some hay to sleep on?

414
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,147
Anything.
-Anything?

415
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:41,066
We have the finest builders
in all the land. We can build you
anything.

416
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:44,945
Seriously,
We are ridiculously
good builders.

417
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:47,489
And we are your servants,
Awesome Gulliver.

418
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:50,159
I don't want to
take advantage,
but...

419
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:03,756
<i>Day 7 of my stay here
in Lliliput. </ i></i>

420
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:06,550
<i>At first, me and the
little guys get off on
the wrong foot </ i></i>

421
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:10,137
<i> but it turns out that
they are a pretty solid
group of dudes. </ i></i>

422
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:13,223
<i> They are building me a
temporary place to live. </ i></i>

423
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:16,685
<i> They threw me an
awesome party just to
release in myself. </ i></i>

424
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:20,147
<i> And the King sent out
a search party to
find my boat. </ i></i>

425
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:24,193
<i> At the meantime,
I'm 'worthing' it. </ i></i>

426
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:33,911
Hmmm, That is a good
cup of joe.

427
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:36,538
Good morning.
Good morning, Gulliver.

428
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:39,833
Top of the morning
to you, fellas.

429
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:56,350
Gulliver
Your media room is ready.

430
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:00,938
Obi-Wan did I tell you
what happened to your father?

431
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:04,525
You told me enough.
You told me you killed him!

432
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:08,195
No, Gulliver!
I am your father!

433
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:10,406
No way.

434
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:14,159
This is an impossibility!
-Yet somehow it seems
completely inevitable.

435
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,162
Gulliver, you truly have lived
a thousand lives.

436
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:21,375
King Theodore, it's time to perform
our bi-weekly military exercise!

437
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:26,463
Just one moment.
We're watching the stories
of Gulliver's life.

438
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:29,216
Sir, we've not missed
a military exercise
over 300 years.

439
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:32,761
Dude!
-Get out of the way!
We can not see the screen.

440
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:38,267
The Titanic is sinking!

441
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:41,020
But it was made
to be unsinkable.

442
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:46,567
"I love you, Gulliver.
-No, no, don't do that."

443
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:50,321
"You're going to make lots
of babies and die on a warm bed
at a very old age."

444
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:58,912
"God."

445
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,998
"I'm the king of the world!"

446
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:11,592
Wait.

447
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:14,011
I'm sorry.

448
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:17,056
You mean to say that
you actually died in the
ship wreck?

449
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:18,974
Yes. I died.
-That's what you're telling us?

450
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,268
You actually died?
-Yeah, but I was resuscitated.

451
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:24,021
It's preposterous!
-But then, I survived!

452
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:25,773
That's ridiculous!

453
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:29,068
Well, you have to see the scene...
-Well, okay now. It's silly!

454
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:32,154
Silly, silly stories!

455
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:36,116
Let me get this straight.

456
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:38,869
After you were brought
back to life as an avatar.

457
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:41,622
That's when you met your Princess
Darcy Silverman, Manhattan.

458
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:44,375
Yeah, I can't wait to get
back to her.

459
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:47,419
I noticed you had a little
eye-contact with the Princess.

460
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,421
How's it going?
-Good, yeah, I think if things
go well...

461
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:53,550
...within 2 to 4 years
she may then speak to me.

462
00:34:54,385 --> 00:34:57,513
Wow... wo... wo...
Hold your horses.
-Thank God.

463
00:34:57,513 --> 00:35:01,558
You can't woo a lady
by hoping that 'then'
she'll speak to you.

464
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:05,854
To land a Princess, you got to
employ some 'grey day cortash'.

465
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,731
Could you teach me?

466
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:10,943
This... this 'Cortage'
that you speak.

467
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,907
Yeah, I can teach you
some of my moves.

468
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:20,285
Yes! Thank you.
-If you beat me back home!

469
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:23,122
On your mark, get set, go!
-I'm not ready to race you!

470
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:37,720
Princess! Oh, Princess!

471
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,222
Wherefore art thou, Princess?

472
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:43,350
Hello, who calls?

473
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,810
It's I, Horatio!

474
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:49,773
Why are you so far away?
I don't want to invoke the ire
of thy father.

475
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,191
But I must be honest.

476
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:53,569
"And tell ye ...
-And tell ye ...

477
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,739
Tell me what, Horatio?

478
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:02,036
"You don't have to be rich
to be my girl."

479
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:04,330
"Say it!"

480
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:08,042
You don't have to be rich
to be my girl.

481
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:13,630
"You don't have to be cool
to rule my world."

482
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:16,717
Horatio, these 'passion' words
can get us into trouble.

483
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:19,511
"There is no particular sign that
I'm more compatible with."

484
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,513
There is no particular sign...

485
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,390
...that I'm more compatible with.

486
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:26,852
"I just want your extra time
and your....

487
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,314
...kiss."

488
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,234
...kiss.

489
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:36,987
Oh, what beauty emanates
from your lips!

490
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:38,864
"I think I'm gonna
dance now."

491
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,702
I think I better
dance now!

492
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:47,831
D-dance now!
Feel it.

493
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:53,128
Put the mustard on, baby.
Yes, feel, move the hips.

494
00:36:57,383 --> 00:36:59,802
I don't think it is
working.

495
00:36:59,802 --> 00:37:01,929
You are not
dancing good.

496
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:03,639
Shake.

497
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:08,769
I've never been wooed
with such unique passion.

498
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:11,647
It's working.

499
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:16,527
Did I tell you? Yes!

500
00:37:16,527 --> 00:37:20,030
I hear someone coming.
'Til tomorrow.

501
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,784
It worked!

502
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:28,330
Let's go!

503
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:31,875
To whom were you speaking,
my Darling?

504
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:37,464
No one.
Me ... I...

505
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:39,591
...was speaking to me, myself.

506
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,677
What are you doing
In my chambers?

507
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:43,470
I have come to court you.

508
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,682
As I always do
at this time of the day.

509
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:51,395
Or have you already forgotten who is
your one true, eternal love?

510
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:54,273
No, of course, I remember.

511
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:57,693
Remember what?

512
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:02,448
That... that you are my
one, true eternal love.

513
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:06,118
It's just that I was talking
with the Giant and lost
track of time.

514
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:07,995
I trust not this Beast.

515
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:10,998
He seems trustworthy to me.
He is very nice.

516
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:14,043
You've done sewing?
-Sewing, yes...

517
00:38:14,043 --> 00:38:18,047
...embroidery. It's my
Grandmother's doily.

518
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:21,717
I captured a hawk today.
-Did you?

519
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:26,597
He laid on the field, I came behind
him and catch him with my bare hand.

520
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:31,143
This is impressive also.

521
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:36,899
Oh... fun!

522
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:40,819
Fun courtship,
you and I have.

523
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:44,573
It is over, now.
Must go!

524
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:47,993
Those villagers
shan't pillage themselves.

525
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:03,509
We must alert General
Edwards of this at once!

526
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:06,470
We found it.

527
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:12,059
I hear you
Ring-A-Ling-A-Ding-Dong.

528
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:14,645
How is it going?
-Hello, Beast.

529
00:39:14,645 --> 00:39:17,690
I come bearing the most
terrific news!

530
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:21,485
Yeah, really?
-We have discovered
your ship!

531
00:39:21,485 --> 00:39:25,990
The "KnotferSail".
Clever name!

532
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:29,785
You did it.
You found my boat!

533
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:32,371
I'm actually going home.

534
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:34,498
Hey, you guys can
fix this thing, right?

535
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:37,167
Of course you can,
you incredibly awesome builders!

536
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:39,044
Yes!

537
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:45,092
Darcy is about to read
the best article ever.

538
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:47,803
Talking 'Pulitzer', huh?

539
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:51,432
Slide to unlock.

540
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:55,060
What're you guys doing?

541
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,814
It's that my phone?
Yeah, it's A-lookin'.

542
00:39:58,814 --> 00:40:02,651
No signal but I have
12 messages,
Mr. Popularity.

543
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:05,279
<i> Hey, Gulliver it's me.
It's Darcy.</ i></i>

544
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:08,407
<i> You know I just realized
why I felt your writing came
straight out of Frommer's... </ i></i>

545
00:40:08,407 --> 00:40:11,702
<i> because it does!
Call me as soon as
you get this. </ I></i>

546
00:40:11,702 --> 00:40:13,329
Sergeant,
what is he doing?

547
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:15,748
He's checking his 'voicemail',
General Edward.

548
00:40:15,748 --> 00:40:17,916
Very good.
What is 'voicemail'?

549
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:21,712
<i> Hey, Lemuel, it's Darcy.
I've totally forgiven you. </ I></i>

550
00:40:21,712 --> 00:40:25,632
<i> Wait, no I haven't!
'Coz now I have get seasick
on a boat... </ i></i>

551
00:40:25,674 --> 00:40:27,509
<i> ...to cover your butt.
Thanks for this. </ I></i>

552
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:31,096
<i> And If you can't tell,
then thanks for sarcastic. </ i></i>

553
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:32,681
<i>Darcy again. </ i></i>

554
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:36,268
<i> I can't believe you
lied to me.
I trusted you. </ I></i>

555
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:42,024
<i> Wherever you're hiding.
Stay there. I never want to hear
from you again!</ I></i>

556
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:49,698
Mr. Beast, I've instructed
our builders to work
day and night...

557
00:40:49,698 --> 00:40:53,369
...to ensure that you are
sea-worthy by week's end.

558
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:57,456
Isn't that the most
fantastic news you've ever
received in your life?

559
00:40:57,456 --> 00:40:59,041
Great...

560
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:02,503
I can't tell you
how happy I am...

561
00:41:02,503 --> 00:41:04,213
...for you.

562
00:41:12,346 --> 00:41:15,766
Why do you look so forlorn,
noble protector?

563
00:41:15,766 --> 00:41:18,602
Me? Forlorn, no way.

564
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:21,105
You do look quite
forlorn.

565
00:41:21,105 --> 00:41:24,358
Just for the record, what does
'forlorn' means again? Is it like sad?

566
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:27,403
Basically, just a bit
more dramatic sounding.

567
00:41:27,403 --> 00:41:31,281
Oh, well, in that case, I guess
I'm a little 'forlorn'.

568
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:33,993
Oh, Gulliver, you miss
your Princess.

569
00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:37,037
Well...

570
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:39,790
The truth is we are not
super close.

571
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,125
Oh, Gulliver ...

572
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:44,586
She's kind of mad at me
right now.

573
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:47,214
I am forlorn as well.

574
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:51,010
I don't know what to do.

575
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:53,387
I think I'm in love
with Horatio.

576
00:41:53,387 --> 00:41:56,724
But that's great.
Don't be forlorn about that.

577
00:41:56,724 --> 00:41:59,435
Most people spend their
whole lives looking for that
and they don't find it.

578
00:41:59,435 --> 00:42:00,769
Go for it!

579
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:03,814
Follow your heart!
-But my heart is promised
to General Edward.

580
00:42:03,814 --> 00:42:06,692
And I can not break
that vow. He will lose honor...

581
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:09,486
...and respect, and he'll
die of heartbreak.

582
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:12,614
Okay, look, he's just
being melodramatic.

583
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:15,075
Is he?
-Yeah.

584
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:19,371
Gulliver, I will miss you so much.
-I'm going to miss you too.

585
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:23,459
Maybe I should stay.

586
00:42:23,459 --> 00:42:26,587
Don't you miss your subjects?
And the White House?

587
00:42:26,587 --> 00:42:28,464
And the Millennium Falcon?

588
00:42:28,464 --> 00:42:33,969
Yeah, but vice president can
run things without me for a while.

589
00:42:35,012 --> 00:42:38,307
You think the king would mind
If I stuck around for a bit?

590
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:43,646
Of course not, Gulliver.
You've made everyone
here so happy.

591
00:42:43,646 --> 00:42:46,106
I can't imagine anyone
in Lilliput not wanting you
to stay...

592
00:42:46,106 --> 00:42:48,192
...as long as possible.

593
00:42:48,192 --> 00:42:51,278
<i> Noble and valiant King Theodore </ i></i>

594
00:42:51,278 --> 00:42:54,782
I trusteth not this Beast Gulliver
who liveth in our midst.

595
00:42:54,782 --> 00:42:57,660
He can now leaveth,
but he chooses to stay.

596
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:01,664
And furthermore, I do not
believeth who he saith
he isth.

597
00:43:01,664 --> 00:43:04,166
I mosteth humbly
disagreeth.

598
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:07,878
And whyeth must we always
go on with these 'Fs'?

599
00:43:07,878 --> 00:43:10,214
Because we speak
officiallyeth?

600
00:43:10,214 --> 00:43:13,342
Forget it, from now on,
even when speaking officially...

601
00:43:13,342 --> 00:43:15,094
...we must get rid of these 'Fs'.

602
00:43:15,094 --> 00:43:17,930
Official speaking is an
illustrious Lilliputian tradition!

603
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:22,601
Woh....'Inside-castle-voice'
please.

604
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:24,395
Forgive meeth.

605
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:28,232
Forgive me.

606
00:43:28,899 --> 00:43:32,236
You know I think this job's
beginning to stress you out.

607
00:43:32,236 --> 00:43:34,738
Maybe a little 'Time-off'
will be the thing.

608
00:43:35,948 --> 00:43:38,492
Who else could
run your army?

609
00:43:38,492 --> 00:43:41,704
<i>Our new General,
Gulliver! </ I></i>

610
00:43:41,704 --> 00:43:44,164
I won't let you down, King.

611
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:48,711
And I look forward to
working with you,
Vice-General Edward.

612
00:43:52,506 --> 00:43:54,466
Vice General?

613
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:56,969
Vice.
I've never been a "Vice"
of anything.

614
00:43:56,969 --> 00:44:00,889
I can't be expected to take orders
from that gigantic fool!

615
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:03,809
I rather take orders from
a woman. You are relieved.

616
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:05,936
Thank you
Vice-General Edward.

617
00:44:09,898 --> 00:44:13,068
Alright, Gulliver,
protect against this!

618
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:25,456
They have turned off
their defence system.
Alert the king!

619
00:44:25,456 --> 00:44:27,249
And prepare the Armada.

620
00:44:40,846 --> 00:44:44,516
Oh, no. Our defence system
has failed.

621
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:47,645
We shall never reach
our ships on time.

622
00:44:47,645 --> 00:44:50,856
<i> Careful now.
Mind yourselves. </ I></i>

623
00:44:50,856 --> 00:44:52,900
<i> Oh what a mess. </ i></i>

624
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,860
They are defenseless.

625
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:57,488
Ceasefire
and ready the troops!

626
00:44:57,529 --> 00:45:00,449
Gulliver!
The Blefuscians attacked.

627
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:03,994
Are you sure?
-Yes!

628
00:45:03,994 --> 00:45:07,164
Please! We need you.
You are our General.

629
00:45:14,421 --> 00:45:15,964
Good Lord!

630
00:45:15,964 --> 00:45:19,677
It's the entire Blefuscian Armada!
-I know.

631
00:45:27,518 --> 00:45:31,188
Finally!
Our General has arrived.

632
00:45:31,188 --> 00:45:33,315
What's going on?
I heard the bells.

633
00:45:33,315 --> 00:45:36,402
As our 'mighty' General,
you must lead the army...

634
00:45:36,402 --> 00:45:41,073
...to save Lilliput and vanquish
the entire Blefuscian Armada.

635
00:45:43,409 --> 00:45:46,245
You want me to
vanquish all of them?

636
00:45:46,245 --> 00:45:50,207
Yes, please.
Everyone last one of them.

637
00:45:50,249 --> 00:45:53,460
Yeah, fine.
-Thank you, fair Gulliver!

638
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,171
Okay. Here we go.

639
00:45:57,715 --> 00:45:59,758
Time to vanquish.

640
00:46:05,097 --> 00:46:06,974
It's cold.

641
00:46:13,314 --> 00:46:17,026
No problem.
You're going down.

642
00:46:30,956 --> 00:46:34,710
Why have we stop?
-It's him!

643
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:46,472
Hey, dudes.

644
00:46:46,472 --> 00:46:48,515
I am Gulliver.
I come in peace.

645
00:46:48,515 --> 00:46:51,268
Listen, They want me
to vanquish you guys.

646
00:46:51,268 --> 00:46:54,063
I don't want to vanquish anybody
and you don't want to be vanquished.

647
00:46:54,063 --> 00:46:56,273
Let's just pretend,
okay?

648
00:46:56,273 --> 00:46:58,776
I'll go crazy,
you act all scared,
and...

649
00:46:58,776 --> 00:47:02,279
Just follow my lead, alright?
Sell it!

650
00:47:07,576 --> 00:47:12,039
Turn the ships!
Sound the alarm!

651
00:47:17,252 --> 00:47:20,798
This truly is
the battle of the ages!
-It truly is!

652
00:47:25,844 --> 00:47:30,265
I'll just tell them you're
too swift or whatever ...
How come you all turned around?

653
00:47:30,265 --> 00:47:32,017
Fire!

654
00:47:34,895 --> 00:47:38,315
Oh no!
That looks painful!

655
00:47:58,293 --> 00:48:00,170
I am invincible.

656
00:48:01,213 --> 00:48:03,716
Yes! Go on, Gulliver!

657
00:48:27,865 --> 00:48:31,744
Well done!
Excellent!

658
00:48:33,078 --> 00:48:36,081
Well done,
you big fat pig.

659
00:48:43,088 --> 00:48:44,965
Pound it.

660
00:48:44,965 --> 00:48:47,343
Well done, Gulliver!

661
00:49:05,277 --> 00:49:07,488
This is glorious!

662
00:49:07,488 --> 00:49:09,615
Goal!

663
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:12,910
Alright!

664
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:17,956
Yeah! Guys, this is what
I'm talking about!

665
00:49:17,956 --> 00:49:21,502
Look at that! The Billboards
and the lights.

666
00:49:21,502 --> 00:49:24,129
Home sweet home.
What can I say?

667
00:49:24,129 --> 00:49:28,175
Okay, can you guys send over
a division to my left shoulder, please?

668
00:49:28,175 --> 00:49:30,052
North 2 clicks.

669
00:49:30,052 --> 00:49:31,845
One click.

670
00:49:31,845 --> 00:49:35,182
Oh, yeah!
That's the spot!

671
00:49:37,351 --> 00:49:40,270
A little off the top.
Don't go crazy.

672
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:43,941
And don't shave off my sideburns.
I need those monkey chaffs.

673
00:50:19,518 --> 00:50:23,230
Can I double the bet with you because
I was playing and singing.

674
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:27,026
You did good though.
Let's try again from the top!

675
00:50:27,026 --> 00:50:30,654
One second, please. Pause game.
-Pause game.

676
00:50:30,654 --> 00:50:32,072
I was just thinking.

677
00:50:32,072 --> 00:50:34,825
You are the General of Lilliput now.
Shouldn't you be training the army?

678
00:50:34,825 --> 00:50:36,869
What if Blefuscian should
attack again?

679
00:50:36,869 --> 00:50:40,080
Oh, man, no one's going to attack.
Not while I'm around.

680
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,832
I'm one-man wrecking crew.

681
00:50:41,832 --> 00:50:43,208
If you want to worry
about something...

682
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:46,337
You should worry about how you haven't
made a move on the Princess yet.

683
00:50:46,337 --> 00:50:49,173
You're in danger of falling
in the 'Friendship Lagoon'.

684
00:50:49,173 --> 00:50:51,675
What?
Yeah, 'Friendship Lagoon'.

685
00:50:51,675 --> 00:50:55,346
It blows. You'll gonna be like:
"Oh yeah, We're friends,
that's great, I'm cool with that."

686
00:50:55,346 --> 00:50:59,099
And you won't be cool with that!
And it kills you inside!

687
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:02,019
No, never.

688
00:51:02,019 --> 00:51:05,230
Yeah, man!
You got to 'man-up' and
be direct.

689
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:09,026
Next time you see her
Just tell her: "What's up?".

690
00:51:09,026 --> 00:51:13,072
"Hey, what's up sexy? I hope it's not
too forward but I find you incredibly sexy. "

691
00:51:13,072 --> 00:51:15,240
"I never told you before,
but I'm really into you."

692
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,410
"But I'm also into a lot of things.
So don't get too excited."

693
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:22,039
"There're a lot of things going on.
I like you to be one of them."

694
00:51:22,039 --> 00:51:25,626
See the way I mixed it up?
I want you, but not that much.

695
00:51:25,626 --> 00:51:28,504
You try it!
Okay, show which face?

696
00:51:28,504 --> 00:51:31,423
Dude, you know,
if the face comes to you
but make it look natural.

697
00:51:31,423 --> 00:51:36,887
Don't make it a forced face.
I just have, you know, one of those
faces that just happen naturally.

698
00:51:38,305 --> 00:51:41,016
My hands are sweating.
-Go!

699
00:51:43,727 --> 00:51:47,523
Well, hello,
fine maiden with the wide...

700
00:51:47,523 --> 00:51:49,400
...child-bearing hips.

701
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:53,320
Yikes, you don't want to talk about
"wide child-bearing hips."

702
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:59,201
It's a good instinct. You're getting there.
But this time more smooth and sexy.

703
00:51:59,201 --> 00:52:01,286
No "big hips"?
--No "big hips".

704
00:52:01,328 --> 00:52:02,871
I've got it.

705
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:09,003
Well, hello there, slim.

706
00:52:09,837 --> 00:52:12,589
I ought to call you Portamus

707
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:16,051
because you've
got no hip.

708
00:52:22,349 --> 00:52:24,476
Do we have to be
here for this?

709
00:52:24,476 --> 00:52:26,687
Take five.
Save game.

710
00:52:26,687 --> 00:52:29,732
Forget about the hips.
Here's what you've got to do.

711
00:52:36,196 --> 00:52:38,657
What are you doing
In my chambers?

712
00:52:38,657 --> 00:52:42,453
I have come to court you.
as I always do at this time
of the day.

713
00:52:42,453 --> 00:52:46,498
This is not the time of day
for courting. You cannot
just barge in.

714
00:52:46,498 --> 00:52:48,459
I can court you
when I wish to court you.

715
00:52:48,459 --> 00:52:52,004
I'm not in the mood to be courted.
I have a headache.

716
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:55,758
It's your womanly duty.

717
00:52:55,758 --> 00:52:58,510
Section 4.2 of the
Official Courting Doctrine.

718
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:00,721
Edward!

719
00:53:00,721 --> 00:53:05,100
I'm unsure about
things between us.

720
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:08,854
It be not you.
It be me but I'm
very unsure.

721
00:53:08,854 --> 00:53:11,023
That maketh no sense.

722
00:53:11,023 --> 00:53:14,568
We ought to be married.
You are to be my bride.

723
00:53:14,568 --> 00:53:17,988
We are not in love.
We're not in love.

724
00:53:17,988 --> 00:53:20,574
Who do you love about me?
Name one thing.

725
00:53:23,077 --> 00:53:25,621
Inappropriate, Edward.

726
00:53:30,542 --> 00:53:32,002
Reach for it.
-One second!

727
00:53:32,002 --> 00:53:33,879
Okay. Take your time.

728
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:38,050
I find you...

729
00:53:38,759 --> 00:53:43,722
absolutely...
satisfactory.

730
00:53:43,722 --> 00:53:48,143
Edward, that's not enough
to say that someone is average,
or adequate or moderate.

731
00:53:48,143 --> 00:53:50,688
I want to be loved
for who I am!

732
00:53:50,688 --> 00:53:53,315
There's an awful lot
going on up here.

733
00:53:53,315 --> 00:53:55,025
Is there?
-Now you're being cruel.

734
00:53:55,025 --> 00:53:58,862
And frankly, melodramatic.
And acting like a complete baby!

735
00:53:58,862 --> 00:54:01,824
You are acting like a little Princess!
-I am a Princess!

736
00:54:01,824 --> 00:54:05,369
Maybe I should
act like a Princess.

737
00:54:05,369 --> 00:54:08,789
Gulliver was so right about you!
-Why don't we all just listen
to the Beast!

738
00:54:08,789 --> 00:54:11,166
Don't call him that!
-He's a big ugly Beast

739
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:13,419
And you should know better!
-Get out!

740
00:54:14,044 --> 00:54:16,630
You can't break our engagement!
It's a fate worse than death.

741
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:18,424
Get out!

742
00:54:21,927 --> 00:54:25,431
You'll be sorry you ever crossed
General Edward!

743
00:54:33,939 --> 00:54:36,817
<i>Get your Gulliver T-shirt! </ i></i>

744
00:54:36,817 --> 00:54:40,029
<i> You sir!
Get your Gulliver T-shirt! </ i></i>

745
00:55:25,783 --> 00:55:27,576
What do you want?

746
00:55:30,329 --> 00:55:33,540
This Beast has transformed Lilliput...

747
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:37,419
...into his own sordid and
rotten little kingdom!

748
00:55:37,419 --> 00:55:41,507
And he will do the same to your land
if we do not stop him.

749
00:55:41,507 --> 00:55:46,553
To save Lilliput,
I must first destroy it.

750
00:55:46,553 --> 00:55:51,392
How do you suggest we complete
such a dangerous task?

751
00:56:08,283 --> 00:56:11,662
<i> Alright! Welcome to the first
ever Lilipaloosa! </ I></i>

752
00:56:11,662 --> 00:56:14,665
Let's get this party started
with a little gem I wrote!

753
00:56:16,166 --> 00:56:17,668
Right?

754
00:56:17,668 --> 00:56:19,545
So what are you
up to tomorrow?
-Tomorrow?

755
00:56:19,545 --> 00:56:23,424
Yes.
-I'm just hanging,
you know.

756
00:56:25,217 --> 00:56:29,179
Would you care to attend
the Ball of the Moonlight with me?

757
00:56:29,221 --> 00:56:31,765
Oh, the Ball!
The Ball's tomorrow!

758
00:56:31,765 --> 00:56:33,976
Right. Maybe.

759
00:56:37,104 --> 00:56:39,315
Why are you acting
like this?

760
00:56:39,315 --> 00:56:42,318
Acting like what?
-Why are you being
so strange?

761
00:56:43,193 --> 00:56:48,782
I am a gentleman merchant about town,
and I have got to keep my options open.

762
00:56:48,782 --> 00:56:50,242
Do you?

763
00:56:50,242 --> 00:56:52,661
That's what I've been told.
-Well, I'm not an 'option'.

764
00:56:52,661 --> 00:56:57,291
I'm a lady.
-I know you are. And I love ladies.

765
00:56:58,792 --> 00:57:00,544
I'm sorry...

766
00:57:06,425 --> 00:57:07,843
Five bells.

767
00:57:07,843 --> 00:57:12,556
What does five bells mean?
-There've never been 5 bells!

768
00:57:12,556 --> 00:57:14,391
Don't worry about it.

769
00:57:14,391 --> 00:57:18,896
'Coz this guy throws down no matter
how many bells they're ringin'.

770
00:57:24,652 --> 00:57:28,864
Don't freak, little peeps.
This one's on me.

771
00:57:37,289 --> 00:57:40,918
You gotta be kidding me.
This is 5 bells?

772
00:57:44,838 --> 00:57:46,215
Ha... it's cute!

773
00:57:46,215 --> 00:57:50,177
Edward, you traitor! How dare
you forsake your lilliputian
brothers?

774
00:57:50,177 --> 00:57:52,262
I only forsoken
for I was forsoken!

775
00:57:52,262 --> 00:57:55,015
'Forsoking' ends now.

776
00:57:55,015 --> 00:57:58,018
I challenge you to a duel!

777
00:57:59,228 --> 00:58:00,980
Cool. Whatever.

778
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:04,149
Do you accept?
-Oh... Yeah!

779
00:58:04,149 --> 00:58:06,944
Yeah, I accept your duel.

780
00:58:06,944 --> 00:58:09,655
Good.
-Make a move.

781
00:58:36,724 --> 00:58:39,226
Wow! You are hard.

782
00:58:44,606 --> 00:58:49,486
Okay, just stretching up.
It is a good thing to do
before the duel.

783
00:58:57,328 --> 00:59:00,414
You brought this
on yourself, Beast.

784
00:59:00,414 --> 00:59:01,957
Do you surrender,
Beast?

785
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:04,543
Sure, yeah,
whatever!

786
00:59:04,543 --> 00:59:07,171
No, no, no...Say it properly,
Say it, you surrender!

787
00:59:09,006 --> 00:59:11,842
Say it! Say it!
Say!

788
00:59:11,842 --> 00:59:14,219
I surrender!

789
00:59:14,219 --> 00:59:15,888
I surrender!

790
00:59:15,888 --> 00:59:17,306
You win.
Release my butt.

791
00:59:17,306 --> 00:59:20,643
You can not surrender.
You are our most glorious
protector!

792
00:59:20,643 --> 00:59:22,227
You are 'President
The Awesome'!

793
00:59:22,227 --> 00:59:25,189
You and Captain Sparrow defeated
The Joker and Magneto.

794
00:59:25,189 --> 00:59:28,484
And you and Jack Bauer had
only 24 hours to do it.

795
00:59:28,484 --> 00:59:30,611
I didn't do any
of that stuff.

796
00:59:30,611 --> 00:59:32,946
I'm just the guy
from the mailroom.

797
00:59:32,946 --> 00:59:35,866
But you gave us your word!
-I'm sorry.

798
00:59:37,326 --> 00:59:39,161
I lied.

799
00:59:39,828 --> 00:59:41,288
I knew it!

800
00:59:42,456 --> 00:59:46,168
I hereby banish this Beast
to the island where we
dare not go!

801
00:59:46,168 --> 00:59:48,962
Never to return
to Lilliput again!

802
00:59:49,838 --> 00:59:51,799
Take your positions!

803
00:59:57,888 --> 00:59:59,807
Please Gulliver!

804
01:00:13,737 --> 01:00:17,074
Hey, is this 'Island that
we dare not go' really
as bad as they say?

805
01:00:17,074 --> 01:00:19,118
It's delightful!

806
01:00:56,071 --> 01:01:00,284
Okay, no little people anywhere.
It's a good sign.

807
01:01:00,284 --> 01:01:04,163
Hello! Is anybody here?!

808
01:01:13,505 --> 01:01:15,424
No way!

809
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:25,434
Raise the flag!

810
01:01:39,114 --> 01:01:42,368
Can I not walk alone
in my own garden?

811
01:01:42,368 --> 01:01:43,869
Go away!

812
01:01:57,508 --> 01:01:59,343
Princess.

813
01:02:01,762 --> 01:02:05,265
I've secured a boat.
We can leave tonight.

814
01:02:05,265 --> 01:02:06,850
No, Horatio.

815
01:02:08,102 --> 01:02:09,937
But Edward's going to
force you to marry him.

816
01:02:09,937 --> 01:02:11,939
I don't have any choice.

817
01:02:11,939 --> 01:02:13,524
Please, please...

818
01:02:13,524 --> 01:02:15,025
Yes, of course you have a choice.

819
01:02:15,025 --> 01:02:17,861
You made that choice for me.
-You don't understand.

820
01:02:18,988 --> 01:02:22,658
Gulliver told me...
-Everything Gulliver said
was a lie.

821
01:02:22,658 --> 01:02:24,535
Including you.

822
01:02:41,385 --> 01:02:44,596
Oh, I'm paralysed from the waist down.
What's that crawling on me?

823
01:02:44,596 --> 01:02:48,267
Not fire ants. Oh please
don't be fire ants.

824
01:02:48,267 --> 01:02:52,438
Am General Edward Edwardian.
Commander of the new Blefuscia.

825
01:02:52,438 --> 01:02:53,981
All hail Blefuscia!

826
01:02:53,981 --> 01:02:57,234
<i>All hail Blefuscia!
-I must warn Gulliver!</i>

827
01:02:57,234 --> 01:03:00,738
State your name,
She-Beast.

828
01:03:00,738 --> 01:03:04,533
Darcy Silverman.
-Of Manhattan?

829
01:03:04,533 --> 01:03:06,785
Ahhhhhh...!

830
01:04:06,512 --> 01:04:08,931
<i> Noooo......! </ i></i>

831
01:04:32,746 --> 01:04:34,415
I'm not doing this.

832
01:04:35,416 --> 01:04:39,253
You got me in the diapers and dress.
I'm not doing tea-time with you.

833
01:04:39,253 --> 01:04:41,171
Go find another doll!

834
01:04:47,052 --> 01:04:49,638
Tea-time...
time for tea!

835
01:04:51,432 --> 01:04:53,350
Okay, we're kissing.
Ohhh....

836
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:56,437
Gentle-r!
Just hold hands, will you?

837
01:05:07,573 --> 01:05:10,659
What's up?
What kind of toy are you?

838
01:05:11,368 --> 01:05:13,412
Top Gun, G.I Joe?

839
01:05:13,412 --> 01:05:15,080
Cool detail.

840
01:06:08,676 --> 01:06:11,929
<i> Gulliver! Gulliver! </ i></i>

841
01:06:13,514 --> 01:06:15,182
Down here!

842
01:06:15,182 --> 01:06:16,809
What are you doing here?

843
01:06:16,809 --> 01:06:19,353
Gulliver, you must
return to Lilliput at once!

844
01:06:19,353 --> 01:06:22,898
Forget it, man, it's a No-Go.
-No! you don't understand! Edward ...

845
01:06:22,898 --> 01:06:24,274
Doesn't matter.

846
01:06:24,274 --> 01:06:26,735
I may be a hundred feet tall, but
I'm not half the size of...

847
01:06:26,735 --> 01:06:29,655
...one of you little guys.
-You've got to listen to me,
this is important!

848
01:06:29,697 --> 01:06:31,740
No. This is where I belong.

849
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:34,785
As a giant girl's
babydoll.

850
01:06:34,785 --> 01:06:37,746
Hey! Stop feeling sorry
for yourself and listen!

851
01:06:38,831 --> 01:06:41,000
Blefucian has taken
over Lilliput and Edward,...

852
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,335
...has captured
Darcy Silverman
of Manhattan.

853
01:06:43,335 --> 01:06:44,712
What?

854
01:06:44,712 --> 01:06:48,132
She's... Darcy's here?
-Yeah!

855
01:06:48,132 --> 01:06:52,386
Oh no! She said she was going
to do the assignment herself.

856
01:06:52,386 --> 01:06:56,181
She's here because of me.
-It's all because of you.

857
01:06:57,224 --> 01:06:59,601
How could you lie to us?

858
01:06:59,601 --> 01:07:03,355
I was afraid to tell
you guys the truth.

859
01:07:03,355 --> 01:07:08,444
Because it was just so great
being a Big shot for the
first time in my life.

860
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:11,947
I didn't want it to end.

861
01:07:11,947 --> 01:07:15,868
Snap out of it, man.
You think of yourself as this
small little thing.

862
01:07:15,868 --> 01:07:17,536
But that's not how
I see you.

863
01:07:17,536 --> 01:07:20,539
Think about what've done already.
You saved the Princess,...

864
01:07:20,539 --> 01:07:24,668
You single-handedly defeated
the entire Blefuscian Armada.
Didn't you?

865
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:27,421
Come on,
I'm your best friend.

866
01:07:27,421 --> 01:07:30,424
I wouldn't lie to you.
You can do this.

867
01:07:30,424 --> 01:07:34,219
So take off that dress
and let's get out of here!

868
01:07:34,219 --> 01:07:36,722
Am I really your
best friend?

869
01:07:36,722 --> 01:07:40,809
You're kind of my only friend.
-It's great, man. You too for me.

870
01:07:40,809 --> 01:07:43,896
Let's go save Lilliput.
-Yeah, let's go do this.

871
01:07:45,022 --> 01:07:47,024
Take me with you!

872
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:52,112
One second. There we go.
-I gotcha.

873
01:07:54,281 --> 01:07:56,241
Okay, officer...

874
01:07:56,241 --> 01:08:00,412
I'm just going to borrow this
parachute, if it's okay with you.

875
01:08:00,412 --> 01:08:02,331
You don't need it anymore.

876
01:08:13,384 --> 01:08:15,386
This is insane!

877
01:08:36,532 --> 01:08:40,244
Oh, I'll let you.
-Thanks, Horatio.
-Good luck!

878
01:08:40,244 --> 01:08:41,954
I got this.

879
01:08:43,372 --> 01:08:46,667
Darcy! Darce!

880
01:08:48,085 --> 01:08:51,296
Gulliver!
-Hey! I'm coming over there.

881
01:08:54,883 --> 01:08:57,428
Are you okay?
I can't believe you're here.

882
01:08:57,428 --> 01:08:59,763
I mean, of all the places,
right?

883
01:09:02,558 --> 01:09:04,601
What's up?
-What's up? What's up?

884
01:09:04,601 --> 01:09:08,022
What isn't up? Can you talk
about the inverted whirlpool.

885
01:09:08,022 --> 01:09:09,398
Crazy...

886
01:09:09,398 --> 01:09:11,567
And why does everybody
calling me a "Princess"?

887
01:09:11,567 --> 01:09:13,902
They don't.
I think you misheard.

888
01:09:13,902 --> 01:09:16,447
I see you've returned
for your "Princess".

889
01:09:16,447 --> 01:09:20,284
Now, you heard it right there.
He just called me your "Princess"?

890
01:09:20,284 --> 01:09:24,455
That's because everybody is
a Princess here. I forgot to tell you,
It's just this sort of a thing.

891
01:09:24,455 --> 01:09:27,082
If you wish to speak to
your one true love
more privately...

892
01:09:27,082 --> 01:09:29,251
...we should cover
our ears.

893
01:09:29,251 --> 01:09:31,754
"One true love"?

894
01:09:31,795 --> 01:09:34,381
I told them
I was your "one true love"?

895
01:09:37,176 --> 01:09:40,888
Is it now a good or bad time
to tell you about...

896
01:09:40,888 --> 01:09:45,184
...the crush I've had on you
for the last 5 years?

897
01:09:45,184 --> 01:09:46,894
Really?

898
01:09:47,853 --> 01:09:50,689
Yeah. I totally have
a crush on you.

899
01:09:50,689 --> 01:09:53,817
That's why you're always wheel in
the mail cart around and none
of the mail is for me?

900
01:09:53,817 --> 01:09:57,529
Yeah. Hmm...Yeah.

901
01:10:00,324 --> 01:10:04,912
I told everyboby that you're
my 'girlfriend'. It's really embarrassing.

902
01:10:04,912 --> 01:10:07,081
I think it's kinda sweet.

903
01:10:08,499 --> 01:10:12,920
Gulliver, we've gotta focus.
We've got a book to the podium.
We're gonna get the hell out of here.

904
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:15,381
We are surrounded by
little people?
-Darcy, listen to me.

905
01:10:15,381 --> 01:10:18,467
I would love to book with you,
over to the boat right now.
but I can't.

906
01:10:19,218 --> 01:10:22,846
These little people have grown
very large in my heart.

907
01:10:22,846 --> 01:10:25,808
They depended on me
and I let them down.

908
01:10:25,808 --> 01:10:28,060
I have to do this first.

909
01:10:34,775 --> 01:10:36,443
King...

910
01:10:36,443 --> 01:10:40,030
If it's alright with you,
I would like to be your
glorious protector again.

911
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:44,201
I don't know. How are we to believe
anything you say, Gulliver?

912
01:10:44,201 --> 01:10:46,954
Because my word
is my bond...

913
01:10:46,954 --> 01:10:48,956
...this time, for real.

914
01:10:48,956 --> 01:10:52,126
I promise.
-Gulliver.

915
01:10:55,838 --> 01:10:58,299
You work in the mailroom
-Not today...

916
01:10:58,299 --> 01:10:59,883
I don't!

917
01:11:40,549 --> 01:11:42,426
Hey, Edward!

918
01:11:43,385 --> 01:11:47,890
If I win, Lilliput returns
to her former glory.

919
01:11:47,890 --> 01:11:50,267
And if you lose.

920
01:11:50,267 --> 01:11:53,646
This is what becomes of Lilliput!

921
01:12:10,954 --> 01:12:12,998
Oh, I've made a
slight improvement.

922
01:12:18,087 --> 01:12:20,089
Shocking, isn't it?!

923
01:12:26,512 --> 01:12:28,973
Hey, hey that's not fair.
He's cheating!

924
01:12:28,973 --> 01:12:31,141
I've got to do
something!

925
01:12:35,646 --> 01:12:39,650
Now, do what you do best, Beast,
and run off!

926
01:12:39,650 --> 01:12:43,112
No way.
Not today.

927
01:12:45,406 --> 01:12:50,160
I've always liked you, Gulliver.
I've always thought we had
a real 'spark'.

928
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:53,288
Hang on, Gulliver!
I'm on my way!

929
01:13:21,859 --> 01:13:24,236
Gulliver, no!

930
01:13:24,236 --> 01:13:27,364
I'll sizzle ya bit by bit!

931
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:52,473
It is hot!

932
01:14:02,983 --> 01:14:06,403
Go, Gulliver!
-Yes, Gulliver, go!

933
01:14:11,492 --> 01:14:13,994
Take it!

934
01:14:32,596 --> 01:14:34,556
Now that's a Wedgie!

935
01:14:34,556 --> 01:14:37,101
Yeah, Gulliver!

936
01:14:41,605 --> 01:14:43,399
Did you see that?!

937
01:14:43,399 --> 01:14:45,609
I want you to get back
to the second grade.

938
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,751
I'm so, so sorry.

939
01:15:02,751 --> 01:15:06,255
I hope you can forgive me
for the way I behaved.

940
01:15:07,089 --> 01:15:09,383
You are not an "option".

941
01:15:10,801 --> 01:15:13,846
You're the most beautiful lady
of all the land.

942
01:15:14,596 --> 01:15:19,560
And you're also super cool.
And a stone-cold fox.

943
01:15:25,190 --> 01:15:29,194
Horatio!
Do you realize what
you've done?

944
01:15:30,821 --> 01:15:34,491
You have committed a
'Knight of Valiance'.

945
01:15:34,491 --> 01:15:37,369
I hereby give you
my permission.

946
01:15:47,963 --> 01:15:49,965
Yeah!

947
01:15:51,842 --> 01:15:54,595
Nobody move.
Halt! Stop!

948
01:15:54,595 --> 01:15:58,432
I've kidnapped the Princess.
You've been kidnapped, congratulations.

949
01:15:58,432 --> 01:16:00,768
Enough with the
kidnappings!

950
01:16:04,438 --> 01:16:07,191
<i>Boosh!
Yes!</i>

951
01:16:09,568 --> 01:16:13,697
Listen! I played your eyes all that stuff
because I thought you'll never want to go out
with the dude in the mailroom.

952
01:16:13,697 --> 01:16:16,450
I'm sorry.
That will never happen again.

953
01:16:22,456 --> 01:16:25,751
So...

954
01:16:27,378 --> 01:16:32,049
Prepare for war!
-No! You prepare for war.

955
01:16:32,049 --> 01:16:34,802
I have to do one more
thing real quick.

956
01:16:34,802 --> 01:16:37,930
Kings! Kings!
C'mon guys!

957
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:43,811
What's it with you and the...
executions... and the gallows...
and the stocks... and the war?!

958
01:16:43,811 --> 01:16:45,604
Seriously, war?

959
01:16:45,604 --> 01:16:48,857
Why do war?
What is it good for?

960
01:16:48,857 --> 01:16:50,901
Absolutely not...

961
01:16:51,986 --> 01:16:54,113
<i> ...War! </ i></i>

962
01:16:55,322 --> 01:16:57,616
<i> What is good for?</ i></i>

963
01:16:57,616 --> 01:16:59,159
Absolutely not...

964
01:16:59,159 --> 01:17:01,829
<i> Say it again now...
War! </ i></i>

965
01:17:02,538 --> 01:17:06,125
<i>Good God, y'all...
What is it good for?</ i></i>

966
01:17:06,125 --> 01:17:08,794
For absolutely nil!

967
01:17:08,794 --> 01:17:13,674
<i> War is the enemy
to all mankind </ i></i>

968
01:17:13,674 --> 01:17:17,344
<i> The problems of the world,
blows my mind </ i></i>

969
01:17:17,344 --> 01:17:22,057
<i> Life is much too short and precious
to spend fighting war these days </ i></i>

970
01:17:22,057 --> 01:17:26,353
<i> The Lord gives me life,
He can always take it away! </ i></i>

971
01:17:27,855 --> 01:17:31,608
<i> Good God, y'all!
What is it good for? </ i></i>

972
01:17:31,608 --> 01:17:33,193
<i> Absolutely nothing </ i></i>

973
01:17:33,193 --> 01:17:35,487
<i> Say it again!
War! </ i></i>

974
01:17:37,656 --> 01:17:41,618
<i> What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing! </ I></i>

975
01:17:41,618 --> 01:17:43,579
<i> Listen to me </ i></i>

976
01:17:43,579 --> 01:17:46,874
<i> Peace, love and understanding </ i></i>

977
01:17:46,874 --> 01:17:51,253
<i> Is there no place
for them today? </ i></i>

978
01:17:51,253 --> 01:17:55,633
<i> They say we must fight
to keep our freedom </ i></i>

979
01:17:55,633 --> 01:18:00,012
<i> But the Lord knows there's got to
be a better way </ i></i>

980
01:18:00,012 --> 01:18:02,014
<i> War </ i></i>

981
01:18:02,014 --> 01:18:05,559
<i> Good God, y'all!
What is it good for?!</ i></i>

982
01:18:07,519 --> 01:18:09,688
<i> Say it!
War! </ i></i>

983
01:18:11,649 --> 01:18:14,234
<i> What is it good for?!</ i></i>

984
01:18:15,152 --> 01:18:17,488
<i> Stand up and
Shout it! </ i></i>

985
01:18:27,081 --> 01:18:29,833
Bravo! Lilliput is free.

986
01:18:37,633 --> 01:18:40,177
Gonna miss
Your big friend?

987
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:42,471
A little.
"Yeah?

988
01:18:42,471 --> 01:18:44,598
A lot...
-Oh, dear.

989
01:19:02,491 --> 01:19:04,284
How was Papua
New Guinea?!

990
01:19:04,284 --> 01:19:06,662
It was hot, sticky ...

991
01:19:06,662 --> 01:19:09,873
...and the most mind-boggling
place I have ever seen.

992
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:16,297
The most mind-boggling place
you've ever seen? -Okay, the second
most mind-boggling place.

993
01:19:17,923 --> 01:19:19,883
Oops, sorry.
-Danny!

994
01:19:19,883 --> 01:19:21,844
Here are your morning mails,
Gulliver.

995
01:19:21,844 --> 01:19:24,680
Thank you.
Who's your friend?

996
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:27,808
I'm Mark, just the new guy
in the Mailroom.

997
01:19:27,808 --> 01:19:29,560
Oh, just the Mailroom?

998
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:31,520
Mailroom's 'Whozat',
right, Dan?

999
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:35,899
Yeah, I don't know why he
would say that 'coz there's where all
the great start, y'know.

1000
01:19:35,899 --> 01:19:40,362
Remember, there's no small
jobs. Just small people.

1001
01:19:40,362 --> 01:19:45,034
Teeny, tiny,
teeny little people.

1002
01:19:45,034 --> 01:19:48,579
Haven't I told you that? No small
jobs, tiny, tiny people.

1003
01:19:48,579 --> 01:19:51,790
Can I take you for lunch?
Of course you can.

1004
01:19:53,876 --> 01:19:56,003
My fair 'Princess'.
