332
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,903
OK, here we go.

333
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,492
It was a year in which
the rain had not fallen.

334
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,287
The wind was big
and the basket was small.

335
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,957
For days, I bounced along...

336
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:37,504
...a hungry little kitten with no milk,
no mama, and no litter box.

337
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:42,175
Until I came to rest at a home
for lost children.

338
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,595
[Mews]

339
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,306
Ohh. [chuckles]

340
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:49,933
[Clicks tongue]

341
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:54,020
[Puss] Her name was lmelda.
And, like a mother,

342
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:57,691
she took me into her heart
and raised me as her own.

343
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,985
[Kids shouting]

344
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,444
[Lmelda] Silencio.

345
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,738
Silencio.

346
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:06,116
[Puss] She was an angel of kindness.

347
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,159
ISilencio!

348
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,453
- [Shouting stops]
- [Puss] Most of the time.

349
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:14,207
I'd like to introduce
a new boyjoining us.

350
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:18,044
It's OK, pequeÃ±o.
You show with the face.

351
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,299
Go on.

352
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:27,262
[Mews]

353
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:32,308
[Puss] And that was the moment I met...

354
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,310
Humpty Alexander Dumpty.

355
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,479
[Boy] Hey, whiskers!

356
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,732
You're sitting
in Little Boy Blue's chair.

357
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,401
- [Squeaks]
- Oh, come on. Is this necessary?

358
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,653
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size?

359
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,613
Who asked you, Breakfast?

360
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,240
Remember what lmelda says, Boy Blue:

361
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:50,535
If you're going to blow your top,
you blow your horn instead, right?

362
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,495
- Let's spin him.
- [Shrieks]

363
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,330
Please don't spin me. Do not spin me!

364
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,958
Not again! No! I'm gonna yolk!

365
00:22:57,126 --> 00:23:00,670
[Puss] Even though he took
my beans, the egg stood up for me,

366
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,964
- and I decided then...
- [grunts]

367
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,341
...that I would always have his back.

368
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,218
[Grunts]

369
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,055
[Hisses]

370
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,850
Wow!

371
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,186
That was very impressive. Thanks!

372
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,480
- [Horn blowing]
- [Girl] Hey, egg boy!

373
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,732
[Girl clucks]

374
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,735
[Puss] There was something
about this strange little egg

375
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,862
that intrigued me.

376
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,923
[Shrieks] Oh... it's you.

377
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:46,382
I've been collecting for months now.

378
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,885
You never know when you're gonna
get lucky. You know what I mean?

379
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,306
[Whispering]
Magic beans... is what they are.

380
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:57,393
Hello? You gonna tell all the other kids

381
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,146
that I believe in magic now?
Is that what you're gonna do?

382
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,359
No? What's your name?

383
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,821
- [Mews]
- You don't say much, do you?

384
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,365
I think I'll call you Sparky.

385
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:12,659
Whiskers?

386
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:14,035
Zoltar!

387
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,748
How about Puss?

388
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:22,627
[Puss] Humpty's mind was full
of imagination and invention.

389
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,420
[Humpty] what is that,
50 feet down there?

390
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:29,050
Here we go. Give me a... [yelling] Puss!

391
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:33,346
- [Gasps]
- Look at me, Puss! I'm flying!

392
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:36,057
[Laughs, grunts]

393
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:40,353
[Puss] He spoke of legends
and adventures beyond my wildest dreams.

394
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:43,606
Oh, when I find those
magic beans, they'll grow a vine

395
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,942
straight up into the clouds,

396
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:50,405
where a terrible and a fearsome giant
hoards his greatest treasure...

397
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,199
...the Golden Goose.

398
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,577
Oh, the Golden Goose. Just one.

399
00:24:55,744 --> 00:25:00,707
Just one of her golden eggs...
could set me for life.

400
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,293
It's my destiny, Puss.

401
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:08,923
I can't really explain it,
but I just feel like I belong up there.

402
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:12,135
[Sighs]

403
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,597
Oh, boy. This is awkward.

404
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:19,434
This is kind of a solo dream here.

405
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:22,687
I don't need any dead weight,
you know, holding me down.

406
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,480
[Purring]

407
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:27,775
What are you doing?
Oh, man, that's good.

408
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,571
The eye thing that you're doing,
that is really splendid.

409
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:34,741
OK, let me just think for a second.
All right... OK.

410
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:38,203
Uh... This is crazy, but...

411
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,539
...I am considering a partnership.

412
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,043
I just need to know one thing.

413
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,378
Can you commit?

414
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,797
SÃ­... I can commit.

415
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:53,259
Oh, you can talk!
Could you help me up?

416
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:55,637
[Grunting]

417
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:56,971
OK...

418
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,266
[Humpty] First rule of Bean Club...

419
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:04,729
...you do not talk about Bean Club.

420
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,731
Second rule of Bean Club...

421
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:10,944
...is you don't talk
about Bean Club. You ready?

422
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,237
Ready.

423
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,406
From this day forth,
it shall be known...

424
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,952
Never alone, always together...

425
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,578
Humpty and Puss...

426
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,247
[both] Brothers forever.

427
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:26,751
[Puss] And from that moment on,
we were united on a great adventure

428
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,003
to find the magic beans.

429
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,213
Help me up.

430
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:32,006
Egg me.

431
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:33,800
[Puss] Humpty was the brains...

432
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:36,844
- [screams] Good gracious!
- I never saw him!

433
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,722
- [Humpty] That really hurt!
- [Puss]... and I was the skill.

434
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,058
[Humpty] I'm cracked!

435
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,728
We got red beans, green beans,

436
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:49,065
coffee beans, lima beans...
but no magic beans.

437
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:53,903
- Would you care for a jelly bean?
- Oh, thank you.

438
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:56,531
[Puss] Finding them
meant everything to us.

439
00:26:57,157 --> 00:27:00,076
[Humpty] Oh, I almost forgot
the most important thing.

440
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,911
That's me and you, Puss.

441
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:04,914
Me and you.

442
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:07,583
[Puss] But we never did find them.

443
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:11,004
And, as years passed,
the quest for magic beans

444
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:15,466
seemed more and more
like the dreams of a child.

445
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,676
Aw!

446
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:20,847
[Puss] As teenagers,
Humpty and I looked for trouble...

447
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:22,849
...and often found it.

448
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:27,186
Third time this month, lmelda.
Next time is jail time.

449
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,564
They're just kids. [chuckles]

00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:32,233
They are thieves.

[Lmelda clears throat]

452
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,198
You are better than this.

00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,535
I believe in you with all my heart.

454
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:46,331
Please do not let me down.

455
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,082
I hate this place.

456
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,793
I cannot wait for us to get out of here.

457
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,589
Throw a rock.
It'll make you feel better.

- [Crowd gasps]

Oh, boy. We should go.

460
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,181
[Puss] On instinct, I reacted.

461
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:04,349
Ha!

You saved my mother.

[Cheering]

470
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:39,175
Today we see that courage and bravery

come in all sizes!

[Puss] Little did I know that one moment
would change my whole life.

473
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,601
These are for you, my boy.

474
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:53,606
Wear them as a symbol
of honor... and justice.

475
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:57,527
I will make you proud, Mama.

You already have, my Puss In Boots.

477
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:08,287
[Puss] How strange it was
to give a cat boots...

478
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:11,624
...but, whoa... I looked good!

479
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:15,294
And as the light of my path
grew brighter...

480

00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:27,306
Gracias, Comandante.

Be careful of the company you keep.

484

[Spits]

485
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:35,064
I know! I know, I never should've
tried something without you.

486
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:37,358
You're not stealing
lollipops anymore, Humpty.

487
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:38,734
This is getting serious.

488
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,279
You're right!
We have to be smarter about this.

489

Here, look. We need to think bigger.

and it's perfect.

491
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,203
You and me, in and out, 50 seconds tops.

492
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,998
Will you put that away!
This is our home.

493
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,792
These people have done nothing to us.

494
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,421
Our home? OK, yeah, I get it now.

495
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:02,008
You get some fancy boots
and now you're too good for me?

496
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:03,551
That is not true.

497
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,803
We weren't born here. We're orphans!

498
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,763
All we got is each other,
you understand?

499
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,557
We are better than this.

500
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,477
But we're partners.

501
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,687
We are brothers.

502
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:18,149
But I am not stealing anymore.

503
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:23,154
[Puss] But Humpty
would not give up so easily.

504
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,281
- [Yowls]
- [Humpty] I'm in trouble, Puss!

505
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,658
It's Boy Blue and his gang.
I owe them some money.

506
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,952
They're coming for me.
Just get me over this wall.

507
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,915
I gotta go. Help me up the wall.
Get me up the wall. Hurry! Hurry!

508
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,510
[Distant whistle blowing]

509
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,970
OK, I've got everything.
We did it. Come on, let's go!

510
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:49,639
How could you do this to me?!

511
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,266
I did you a favor!
We can finally get out of here!

512
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:55,061
This is the money of the people!
This is all they have!

513
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:56,729
- [Puss yowls]
- [Groans]

514
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,651
[Gasps] You disgrace those boots!

515
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,694
Comandante, please, I can explain!

516
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:04,946
Arrest them!

517
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,615
- Hiyah!
- [Whinnies]

518
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:11,369
[Humpty] Hurry up! Get to the bridge!

519
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:14,413
- You tricked me!
- I had to! You left me no choice!

520
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,499

- Mama...

523
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:26,759
PequeÃ±o.

524
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:28,594
Oh! Watch out!

525
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,475
Oh! Oof!

526
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:48,698
- Oh, no.
- [Humpty] Puss. I can't get up.

527
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,992
Puss! Help me. I can't get up!

528
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,577
Freeze!

529
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,079
Puss, save me!

530
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:57,206
Save yourself.

531
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,584
[Guard] we got you.

532
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:18,185
[Puss] I lost everything
I cared about that day.

533
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,022
My brother.

534
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,690
My honor.

535
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,358
My home.

536
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:30,448
All I thought about was
the disappointment in my mama's eyes.

537
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,368
And I have been running ever since.

538
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,375
The egg betrayed me.

539
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:46,422
- His lies cost me everything.
- [Snoring]

540
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,717
- Hey!
- [Snorts] I'm awake!

541
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,011
[Humpty] You think
I don't want to fix the past?

542
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,016
I can't get down.

543
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:58,726

[Grunts]

545
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:10,029
Listen. A day... A day doesn't go by

546
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:12,323
when I don't think about what I lost.

547
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:17,036
I lost my best friend.

548
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:20,206
My only friend. And I get it now.

549
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:22,583
I got greedy and desperate
and I let you down.

550
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,794
I let myself down.

551
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,463
All I'm asking for, Puss,
is a second chance.

552
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:31,592
Give me that second chance
and I'll help you pay back San Ricardo.

553
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,679
[Sighs] Please, Puss.

554
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,723
Let me show you
what our friendship meant to me.

555
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,143
[Sighs]

556
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:45,272
- I will do it.
- Oh, that's great.

557
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,444
I will do this for my mother
and for San Ricardo... not for you.

558
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:53,989
We are not partners
and we are not friends.

559
00:33:55,409 --> 00:34:00,621
OK. I promise this time,
I will not let you down.

560
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:03,666
Yes! [laughs]

561
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:06,293
I think we got our Bean Club back.

Humpty's plan better work.

565
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:30,651
Listen, you just need
to worry about your part.

566
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,820
Don't screw it up.

567
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:35,322
- What?
- Again with the mask?

568
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,284
I don't need style advice
from Mr. Dusty Boots.

569
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:39,452
Huh?!

570
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,335
Come on, Puss. Now!

[Both grunting]

Our biological clocks
are tickin', darlin'.

573
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:56,719
You gotta look at the big picture.

574
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:58,971
- What's your problem?
- Huh?

575
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:03,017
Listen. I put a lot of work
into my body. I look good, and I am not

576
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:04,602
- just gonna throw that away.
- [Gasps]

577

- [Whispers] Hey, hey, hey.
- What?

578
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,150
- [Jill] we're gonna start small.
- Look.

579
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:13,402
[Jill] Let's just pretend
you have a baby.

580
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:17,698
Excellent. [chuckles]

581
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,078
[Jill] I don't have time to be at home
with no diapers and baby socks.

582
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,915
You don't have to, Jill.
I'll be the stay-at-home dad.

583
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:28,542
We got ten hungry piggies,
there in the back.

584
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,504
You can practice on them.
Just pull over, feed them.

- You've got to hurry up.

- Shh!
- [Jack] He's a cute little bugger.

Why are you not using your claws?

Would you please just shut up!
I'm on it!

- Just use your claws!
- Be quiet.

651
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:47,658
- We're going to die!

[Shouts echoing]

653
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:02,256
- I hate cats.
- This is war!

Giant's castle...

657
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,810
...here we come.

658
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,815
[Puss sighs] I must hand it to the egg.

659
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:22,776
This was a team effort.
Humpty still has his claws...

660
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:26,113
I mean, flaws.
That was what I meant, not claws.

661
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,282
He's not a cat. [chuckles nervously]

662
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:31,326
- Not to say there's anything wrong...
- I don't want to talk about it.

663
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,870
Got it.

664
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:35,914
[Muttering] OK, we should be close!

665
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,209
Keep your eyes out
for any strange cloud activity!

666
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:43,088
I am called Kitty Softpaws
because I'll steal you blind

667
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,549
and you'll never even know I was there.

Kitty?

671
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:56,185
You are not as good as they say.

672
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:00,189
You're better.

673
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,819
I will respect your privacy.

674
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:12,951
[Kitty sighs] OK. I'll tell you.

675
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,746
I was just a stray...

676
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,582
...but I had beautiful claws.

677
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:23,629
One day,
a really nice couple took me in.

678
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:26,131
Gave me milk every morning.

679
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:27,633
Loved me.

680
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:34,473
Maybe I scratched their curtains
or played too rough with the hamster.

681
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:36,975
I don't know why they did it.

682
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,686
But they took my claws.

683

- Cat people are crazy.

Can you believe this, Puss?

689
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,553
After all these years!

690
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:17,224
Here. I want you to plant them.

691
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,315
That... is a strange cloud.

It's happening, hurry!

694
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:36,034
This way!

695
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,287
Good, good.
Come on, come on, come on.

696
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,706
Twenty-three divided by cloud depth.

697
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:42,541
Hole! Right here.

698
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:47,087
Now place the beans.

699

Place the beans carefully, please.

700
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:54,428
Not on top of each other.
The magic is very delicate.

701

OK, good. Very good.

What's happening here?

710
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,187
Maybe the magic rubbed off
in your pocket?

711
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:48,565
- That's impossible.
- OK, OK. Let's not panic.

712
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,776
You know, I read somewhere
that plants have feelings.

So, come on...
say something nice to it.

714
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:55,906
OK.

715
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,575

Let me show you something.

750
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,028
Somewhere down there,
there are two little kids,

751
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:42,322
I don't know, maybe orphans,

752
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:45,409
and they're laying on a hill,
staring at the clouds,

753
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,327
dreaming about the future.

754

Humpty!

762
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:14,104
[Humpty] I'll fit right in
with the golden eggs.

Brilliant or what, huh?

765
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:23,530
Humpty, you're not wearing underwear!

766
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:26,199
What? Are you embarrassed?

767
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:27,617
I'm not.

768
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:32,372
[Chuckles] Puss, remember when
everyone was laughing at Bean Club?

769
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,542
[Puss] And who is laughing now?
Ha-ha! We are!

770

That is our target.

00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:05,906
[In normal voice] Hey, you don't
sound like an elf anymore.

774
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,782
It's because the air pressure
in here is normal.

775
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:08,950
Let's go.

776
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:16,625
So here is the plan: You two get
the golden eggs, I will fight the giant.

777
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,544
There's no giant to fight.
The giant's been dead for years.

- You didn't do the reading, did you?

- Wha... what was that?
- They call it the Great Terror.

783
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:35,936
It's the monster that guards
the Golden Goose.

784
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:38,605
Legend has it that if you look at it,
you'll turn to stone.

785
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:42,317
But nobody really knows because
nobody's walked away from it alive.

815
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:28,882
[Muffled] I said I couldn't breathe and
then you zipped the thing over my mouth!

816
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:32,469
Shh! Hey. You gotta

You don't know me, Puss.

I'm not who you think I am.
I'm all about the score.

that when we go our separate ways,
we can go our separate ways...

975
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,173
[Grunting]

976
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:16,636
Huh?

977
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:21,224
[Grunting]

978
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,435
Be gone!

979
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:29,482
[Humpty] what do you want?
Gold? I have gold!

980
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:32,485
[Jill laughs]
Jack, egg's trying to bribe us.

981
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:34,278
[Jack chuckling] with our own gold.

982
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:36,405
[Jill] Come on now, all we want
is a little breakfast.

983
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:37,740
[Humpty] No, no, please!

984
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:39,575
[Jack] How do you like
your eggs, pumpkin?

985
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:41,160
Humpty, no!

986
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:43,829
[Humpty screams]

987
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:46,374
[Cackles]

988
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:49,085
[Sighs] Hello, Puss.

989
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:50,878
[All] Surprise!

990
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:53,005
[Laughing]

991
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:55,132
What is going on?

992
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:59,303
It's a surprise party,
and the surprise is on you.

993
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:02,056
Looks like the cat's out of the bag.

994
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:03,683
You were in cahoots?!

995
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:06,310
Oh, yeah! They all work for me.

996
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:13,526
I spent a lot of time in prison
preparing for this.

997
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:16,529
- You set me up.
- Oh, yeah, I set you up. Of course.

998
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:21,033
You think this was all about getting
the gold and clearing your name?

999
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:25,663
This little adventure
was about one thing.

1000
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:27,957
Revenge.

1001
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:35,131
You never knew it, Puss...
but I was always there. [echoing]

1002
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:59,030
You wanted to repay an old debt, Puss?
Well, so did I.

1003
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:02,116
- Why would you do this?
- You left me on that bridge!

1004
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:04,368
You abandoned me
when I needed you the most.

1005
01:01:04,536 --> 01:01:07,163
- What happened to "brothers forever"?!
- I trusted you!

1006
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:09,415
Well, now you're finally
gonna know what it feels like,

1007
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:12,335
you know, to trust someone
and have them stab you in the back.

1008
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,295
Guards!

1009
01:01:14,463 --> 01:01:19,258
Puss In Boots, you're under arrest
for the robbery of the San Ricardo Bank!

1010
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:21,427
Consider this the final
meeting of Bean Club.

1011
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:24,180
- I should scramble you with onions!
- [Shrieks]

1012
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:26,766
You should never have come back.

1013
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:31,354
- [Growls]
- [Lmelda] Â¡PequeÃ±o! Wait.

1014
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,647
Do not fight them, please.

1015
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,609
Mama! Listen to me. I can explain.

1016
01:01:36,777 --> 01:01:41,197
No. Puss, no more running.

1017
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:45,493
Please stop breaking my heart
and face what you have done.

1018
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,289
I'm sorry, Mama.

1019
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:53,042
I let you down.

1020
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:57,922
Paws where we can see them!

1021
01:01:59,091 --> 01:02:01,092
Turn around... slow.

1022
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:04,762
Slower!

1023
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,522
Step into the carrier... quiet-like.

1024
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:23,906
Attention! Attention, everyone!

1025
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:26,283
If you could just come in
a little closer.

1026
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:27,993
Ladies and gentlemen,

1027
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:31,497
I present to you...
the Golden Goose of legend!

1028
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:34,208
- [Peeping]
- [Crowd gasping, chattering]

1029
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,630
Kitty. Not you, too?

1030
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:46,846
[Humpty laughs] Gold for everyone!

1031
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:49,432
Boo! Boo! Boo! [cackles]

1032
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,226
We got some fresh,
hot gold here, people!

1033
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:56,689
Step right up! Get it hot!

1034
01:02:56,857 --> 01:02:59,191
[Crowd] iHuevos! IHuevos! IHuevos!

1035
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,617
One hat.

1036
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,911
One belt.

1037
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:13,330
And two boots...

1038
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:16,292
...once a symbol of honor.

1039
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:20,254
One bottle of catnip?

1040
01:03:20,422 --> 01:03:23,424
Uh... it is for my glaucoma.

1041
01:03:23,592 --> 01:03:26,552
- [Yowls]
- [Door slams]

1042
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:30,598
This is where you belong, outlaw.

1043
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:35,478
And this is
where you will stay... forever.

1044
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:42,526
[Sighs]

1045
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:52,453
- [Man] whoo-hoo!
- [Shrieks]

1046
01:03:52,621 --> 01:03:55,539
No, no. Don't stop on my account.

1047
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:11,764
Well, it looks like the egg
got what he wanted.

1048
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:13,724
You're talking about Humpty?

1049
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:15,476
[Babbles] Don't say his name!

1050
01:04:15,644 --> 01:04:19,230
I used to share this cell
with that smelly thing.

1051
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:22,441
Happiest day of my life was
when he left.

1052
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:25,194
Till I realized he stole my magic beans.

1053
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:28,405
Wait, wait, wait!
You had the beans? Who are you?

1054
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:31,450
- [Snores]
- Hey! What's your name?

1055
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:34,161
[Screams] Andy Beanstalk!

1056
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:36,247
My friends call me Jack.

1057
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:39,625
I traded the family cow for them beans.

1058
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:41,627
Course'n, it wasn't my family's cow.

1059
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:44,797
It was some other family's family cow.
That's why I got eight to ten.

1060
01:04:44,965 --> 01:04:49,051
Always know which cow is yours.

1061
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:51,512
- [Snores]
- Crazy man. Wake up!

1062
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,265
- [Gasps]
- What else do you know?

1063
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:58,352
We're all goners,
thanks to that little stinky!

1064
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:03,566
I told him not to take the goose,
but all he wanted was his revenge!

1065
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:05,943
Don't take the goose. Why?

1066
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:08,070
- [Snores]
- [Groans]

1067
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:13,450
[Gasps] The Great Terror!
That's the Golden Goose's mama.

1068
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:14,868
Oh, no.

1069
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,705
And she will be out for blood

1070
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:21,375
when she comes back for her baby.

1071
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:22,960
[Gasps] Guard!

1072
01:05:23,128 --> 01:05:26,213
San Ricardo is in terrible danger!
You must listen to me!

1073
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:27,381
Quiet, you!

1074
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:42,354
[Puss yowling]

1075
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:47,610
[Yowling continuing]

1076
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:53,324
[Groans] Shut up.

1077
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:58,454
- [Yowling]
- [Groans angrily]

1078
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:04,668
- Shh!
- [Growls]

1079
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:09,340
- [Purring]
- [Gasps]

1080
01:06:10,592 --> 01:06:13,093
Open the door.

1081
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:22,061
Drop the weapon.

1082
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:25,189
Very good.

1083
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:27,524
Step aside.

1084
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:29,860
No. [grunts]

1085
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:31,654
- Diablo Gato!
- [Gasps]

1086
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:34,657
Nice try. [snickers]

1087
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:37,117
[Muffled scream]

1088
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:39,578
Huh?

1089
01:06:46,795 --> 01:06:48,545
I hope you can forgive me.

1090
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:51,173
Apology accepted!

1091
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:54,551
I don't really have time for you.

1092
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,804
I have to save the town
from the Great Terror!

1093
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,847
Wait, Puss!

1094
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,016
Don't you see? I'm here because...

1095
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:04,520
I am here because you made me realize

1096
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:08,232
that there is something
I care about more than gold.

1097
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:10,651
Something?

1098
01:07:10,819 --> 01:07:13,987
OK. Someone.

1099
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:16,699
He's about two feet tall,
wears high heels.

1100
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,325
Handsome?

1101
01:07:18,493 --> 01:07:20,494
He's very handsome.

1102
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:22,579
- A real beefcake?
- Mm-hm.

1103
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:24,039
- A stallion?
- Yes.

1104
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:25,958
- Tiger?
- Oh, brother.

1105
01:07:26,126 --> 01:07:29,211
[Chuckles] But this
does not make us even.

1106
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:32,464
- Freeze!
- Yes, it does.

1107
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:34,425
- No, no, no, it doesn't.
- [Whimpers]

1108
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:36,301
[Both yowling]

1109
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:38,011
[Screams]

1110
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:39,847
I saved you!

1111
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:42,182
You owed me one.

1112
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:44,810
You didn't tell me about Humpty.

1113
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:48,522
So now you owe me two.

1114
01:07:51,443 --> 01:07:53,026
[Guards shouting]

1115
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:55,821
- You're a lot of work.
- I know. But I am worth it!

1116
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:57,614
Ha-ha!

1117
01:08:00,452 --> 01:08:02,870
You are not getting away, Puss In Boots!

1118
01:08:03,538 --> 01:08:05,038
Wrong boots.

1119
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,124
Kitty!

1120
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:09,501
Now we're even! [yowls]

1121
01:08:17,385 --> 01:08:19,970
This is your San Ricardo weather report.

1122
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:22,848
Chances of a giant goose
destroying the town...

1123
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:24,975
...one hundred percent.

1124
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:32,566
[Puss] Never alone, always together...

1125
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:33,984
[Humpty] Humpty and Puss...

1126
01:08:34,152 --> 01:08:35,736
[both] Brothers forever.

1127
01:08:35,904 --> 01:08:38,447
- [Sighs]
- [Peeping]

1128
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:40,157
Come on, sweetie.

1129
01:08:40,325 --> 01:08:42,576
Let's, uh, get out of here
before Mama shows up.

1130
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:46,830
I should make you
into an egg salad sandwich!

1131
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:49,583
[Shrieks] That is disgusting!

1132
