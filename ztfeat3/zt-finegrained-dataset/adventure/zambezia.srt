Thanks for Dutch srt dude! Translated by yusof125 with subtitle edit 3.2.8

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Maribu's at six o'clock.

4
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:11,331
There is food for a week in that basket.

5
00:01:11,602 --> 00:01:12,602
Unpack them.

6
00:01:12,702 --> 00:01:16,442
They walk into.
Shake your tail feathers, Gogo.

7
00:01:25,903 --> 00:01:27,903
Take it.

8
00:01:28,604 --> 00:01:30,604
Touched.

9
00:01:38,605 --> 00:01:41,495
Gogo, we just become aunts.

10
00:01:43,806 --> 00:01:46,806
Hold.
- Seize them.

11
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:49,208
The eggs are beaten here.

12
00:01:49,308 --> 00:01:51,708
Stay away, brutally.

13
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:02,209
Hold on tight, kids.

14
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,760
Severe turbulence for us.

15
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:12,411
Do not worry, Tini.
I take us to Zambezia.

16
00:02:28,176 --> 00:02:31,486
Quality over Quantity (QoQ) ® eleases
Zambezia (2012)

Translation: Pink Jay
Control: Smokey

18
00:02:54,918 --> 00:02:56,918
Come back.

19
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,647
Not your best landing.
- Daddy, what did you expect?

20
00:03:14,747 --> 00:03:16,928
You can not just call
at me when I'm in the zone.

21
00:03:17,028 --> 00:03:20,559
What, the Twilight Zone?
I did not know we now hunt giraffes.

22
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:23,716
I just tried something else.

23
00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:26,872
Good thing you had a helmet on.
- I got nothing.

24
00:03:26,972 --> 00:03:29,862
Come on, time for a real exercise.

25
00:03:30,864 --> 00:03:34,264
Daddy, you're fast for an old bird.

26
00:03:34,457 --> 00:03:36,519
Your father still has a few good moves
.

27
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:39,323
Why do not you go to the side
and see how I do it.

28
00:03:39,423 --> 00:03:43,609
When you were a chick was
you had not such a big mouth.

29
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:46,599
But then I was not so fast.

30
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,780
Not bad for an old bird.

31
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,685
Come on.
- I'm right behind you.

32
00:04:00,766 --> 00:04:04,761
Let's high-speed six
start.

33
00:04:07,984 --> 00:04:09,353
Let me look upward
airflow control.

34
00:04:09,354 --> 00:04:09,965
I will.

35
00:04:10,065 --> 00:04:12,958
Keep the distance fixed.
- Held.

36
00:04:13,058 --> 00:04:15,469
Connect the wings and...

37
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,550
Diving.

38
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:23,005
A crocodile, two crocodile...
- Three crocodile, four crocodile...

39
00:04:23,023 --> 00:04:25,651
Five crocodile.
- Open your wings.

40
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:27,751
Pull on.

41
00:04:34,913 --> 00:04:36,913
Pull on.

42
00:04:49,745 --> 00:04:54,412
I did it.
I can not believe I have succeeded.

43
00:04:54,512 --> 00:04:56,597
What was that?
- I did it.

44
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:59,431
Do you consider yourself dead injagen?
- Five crocodiles.

45
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:02,433
That's gotta be a new record.
Did you see that?

46
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:04,713
I saw a bruiser an idiotic stunt.

47
00:05:04,813 --> 00:05:06,598
Where do you think I have to train?

48
00:05:06,698 --> 00:05:11,118
For the fastest lizard hunter to be.
I do not know.

49
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:16,124
I try just fun.

50
00:05:18,324 --> 00:05:20,449
I know, Kai, but...

51
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,040
Once you take care of yourself.

52
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:27,868
Because nobody else will.

53
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:32,327
Of course, Dad, whatever you say.
- How about lunch?

54
00:05:32,427 --> 00:05:35,108
I got your favorite, insects surprise.

55
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:39,883
They go somewhere.
Why do we never go anywhere?

56
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,508
I've never even been outside the boundary.

57
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:47,080
There is no reason for it.
We have everything to survive.

58
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,580
Is it only that?
Only survive?

59
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,880
Did mother that?

60
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,948
Sorry, Dad, I did not say.

61
00:05:57,048 --> 00:05:59,542
Why do not check the fence
.

62
00:05:59,642 --> 00:06:02,474
I'm doing the rounds along the border.
- I'll go with you.

63
00:06:02,574 --> 00:06:05,039
Check the fence but.

64
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:12,511
Boy, go check the fence.
The third time this week.

65
00:06:12,611 --> 00:06:15,374
Mighty Fortress sticks.
Why do I say that?

66
00:06:15,474 --> 00:06:18,578
Call Mommy, make the fence.
It's just a comparison.

67
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:21,228
Protect against the beasts.

68
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:29,500
Mayday. Take landing position.
- Hold on.

69
00:06:34,545 --> 00:06:39,820
The only thing that is
bandits to eat my dust.

70
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:41,921
No.

71
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:54,873
I have the body of an old woman.

72
00:06:54,874 --> 00:06:57,207
You're an old woman.

73
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:03,004
Hello, the egg.
- Right. Sorry, of course. Here.

74
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,758
Hello, boys.

75
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:20,613
Cute, is not it?
You have a friend for life.

76
00:07:20,869 --> 00:07:23,383
I will have to make that crack.

77
00:07:23,483 --> 00:07:25,189
Those thieving Maribu's.

78
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:28,789
Can you do that?
- She made the whole basket.

79
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:32,277
Where are you from?
Are you visiting someone?

80
00:07:32,377 --> 00:07:34,965
I can not.
We are the only one here, so...

81
00:07:35,065 --> 00:07:38,234
Are you in transit, or...
- We are on a mission.

82
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:42,057
We save these poor babies
for those bandits out there.

83
00:07:42,157 --> 00:07:44,127
Where are you taking them now?

84
00:07:44,227 --> 00:07:48,810
In Zambezia. - There is no
safer place across Africa.

85
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,518
Zambezia?
Where is that?

86
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:55,377
What are you saying?
Have you ever heard of the bird city?

87
00:07:55,477 --> 00:07:58,943
We continued our course than I thought.

88
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:02,657
Darlings, it seems that
Tonight we fly by.

89
00:08:02,757 --> 00:08:07,052
Wait, why rush?
We will never visit, stay here tonight.

90
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:10,273
What? Where should a large
bird as I sleep?

91
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:14,733
Do not worry, we make place.
It's not much but it's our home.

92
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,218
The ducklings can use the rest.

93
00:08:17,318 --> 00:08:19,779
I can hardly see at night.

94
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:23,013
Well, that's a plan.
My name is Kai. Kai, the guy in the air.

95
00:08:23,113 --> 00:08:27,703
So would my friends call me,
if I had friends.

96
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,753
I do not know how long I can keep him here.

97
00:08:33,853 --> 00:08:37,896
He wants to see the world.
Other birds meet.

98
00:08:40,993 --> 00:08:44,694
A free spirit, just like his mother.

99
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,455
I was too harsh.

100
00:08:56,212 --> 00:09:00,145
And all that food.
I'm talking about nuts from Nigeria.

101
00:09:00,245 --> 00:09:04,174
Seeds of Sudan, Burundi bananas.

102
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:06,424
Snails of Swaziland.

103
00:09:06,554 --> 00:09:10,209
Swaziland? Where is that?
Are we there?

104
00:09:11,327 --> 00:09:15,108
Look at these two, are not they cute?

105
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:18,120
We have future Hurricanes.

106
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,930
Hurricanes?
The Hurricanes patrolling the air.

107
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,665
They protect Zambezia.

108
00:09:23,866 --> 00:09:26,829
Hurricanes are the best racers across Africa.

109
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:30,393
The eggs protect the orphans save
fight against the bad guys...

110
00:09:30,493 --> 00:09:36,013
And the big city?
A Hurricane have would be great.

111
00:09:36,414 --> 00:09:38,964
Wait, anyone to Zambezia?

112
00:09:39,064 --> 00:09:44,835
Of course, there are all kinds together.
Well, almost any kind.

113
00:09:44,936 --> 00:09:48,429
Except wanted Maribu's horrible.

114
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:52,312
Who are you?
- You thought we could escape?

115
00:09:52,412 --> 00:09:53,412
Ten attack.

116
00:09:53,512 --> 00:09:55,783
You do not get them while I'm waiting.

117
00:09:55,883 --> 00:09:57,901
We want only the delicacy of that basket.

118
00:09:58,001 --> 00:10:02,268
If we can solve this civilized
no one will get hurt. Understood?

119
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,937
To you is nothing civilized.

120
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,038
Stay away from her.

121
00:10:15,102 --> 00:10:17,919
Daddy.
- What are you doing here?

122
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,425
Daddy.

123
00:10:30,525 --> 00:10:33,500
Do not fight, I'm trying to help.

124
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:40,423
My dear brother.
Stay away from me.

125
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:42,637
I did what I could.

126
00:10:42,737 --> 00:10:47,010
You brought this on yourself.
- You raptors are all the same.

127
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,852
He was just hungry.
We all have.

128
00:10:50,952 --> 00:10:54,437
Maribu if we are already suffering enough.

129
00:10:54,637 --> 00:10:57,464
Why us?

130
00:10:57,765 --> 00:11:00,781
Here you will pay.

131
00:11:00,782 --> 00:11:05,788
Here you will pay.
- Tendai?

132
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:09,702
Tendai, are you really?
After all these years?

133
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:14,444
Kai, I told you
no strangers to take home.

134
00:11:14,544 --> 00:11:19,496
Aliens.
Come little ones, it's time to go.

135
00:11:19,497 --> 00:11:22,557
No way, you just got here.

136
00:11:22,623 --> 00:11:25,003
What was that all about?

137
00:11:26,043 --> 00:11:30,432
Wait. Do you know her?

138
00:11:31,176 --> 00:11:33,471
Maribu And who knew you.

139
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:36,368
The fence must be repaired.

140
00:11:36,468 --> 00:11:39,181
Dad, come on, forget the fence.
Talk to me.

141
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,954
Did you Zambezia off?

142
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:44,532
You knew.

143
00:11:44,632 --> 00:11:47,949
All these years and you've never told me
?

144
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:49,601
I have my reasons.

145
00:11:49,701 --> 00:11:52,935
What reason have you to keep me here?

146
00:11:53,035 --> 00:11:54,772
I do what's best for you.

147
00:11:54,872 --> 00:11:57,718
The best for me?
Look for you. I have...

148
00:11:57,818 --> 00:12:00,258
No friends and nothing to do, no life.

149
00:12:00,358 --> 00:12:02,447
How can it best for me.

150
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:03,547
Gogo said ..

151
00:12:03,647 --> 00:12:05,210
You never had her in our house to let.

152
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:09,936
If you have other birds
helps you get only in trouble.

153
00:12:10,036 --> 00:12:11,980
But in Zambezia they Hurricanes.

154
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,444
Here we would all have no problems.

155
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:17,024
I'll tell you how it goes in Zambezia.

156
00:12:17,124 --> 00:12:19,992
The strong as we protect the weak.

157
00:12:20,092 --> 00:12:22,557
And who dies eventually?

158
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:26,013
We. Trust me
.

159
00:12:26,114 --> 00:12:28,123
You do not know what you're talking about.

160
00:12:28,223 --> 00:12:31,182
Yes, but I'll tell you what I know.

161
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:35,623
There is more to life than you,
your fences and your limits.

162
00:12:35,723 --> 00:12:37,981
There is a whole world outside Khartoum.

163
00:12:38,081 --> 00:12:44,626
Let's go to Zambezia. You, me and...
- I'll never go back there.

164
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:53,212
Then I'm sorry. Day in, day out,
teach me taking care of myself.

165
00:12:53,383 --> 00:12:56,868
Maybe it's time I'm gonna do.

166
00:13:04,203 --> 00:13:06,203
You know where to find me.

167
00:13:36,908 --> 00:13:39,628
<i> I do what's best for you. </ I>

168
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:47,173
<i> Sorry, Dad, I need to do this.
With or without you. </ I>

169
00:13:59,174 --> 00:14:04,108
Greetings, what do
above all alone?

170
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:06,209
I am looking Zambezia.

171
00:14:06,252 --> 00:14:09,605
Then you go in the right direction on
. But you'd better...

172
00:14:09,705 --> 00:14:12,571
Fly with us or you'll really tired.

173
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:17,856
Do not worry about me,
I'm used to fly alone.

174
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:55,820
Are we almost there?
- What will you do in Zambezia?

175
00:14:57,303 --> 00:14:59,938
I would like for the Hurricanes.

176
00:15:00,355 --> 00:15:03,734
A small bird with big dreams.
- Something like that.

177
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:05,726
Look.

178
00:15:05,826 --> 00:15:08,611
I'm a Hurricane.

179
00:15:16,446 --> 00:15:18,885
I'm depressed.

180
00:15:20,388 --> 00:15:24,532
I am very depressed.

181
00:15:26,338 --> 00:15:30,829
You know what I like to do when I'm down?
Food.

182
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,258
Try these little fellows here. Those who...

183
00:15:33,358 --> 00:15:34,358
Why us?

184
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:38,878
They have the nerve to call us bandits.
Enter.

185
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:43,873
And now one of them...

186
00:15:44,074 --> 00:15:47,342
Robbed me of my only brother.

187
00:15:47,743 --> 00:15:51,298
And now I'm...

188
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:53,922
Only in the world.

189
00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:00,170
Well, not entirely alone.
You have me, your fourth cousin.

190
00:16:00,195 --> 00:16:03,998
Once removed, that's something, is not it?

191
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:06,945
Death is normal.
- Budzo.

192
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:11,163
It is part of the life cycle.

193
00:16:12,564 --> 00:16:14,772
The last part.

194
00:16:17,652 --> 00:16:21,307
<i> I should not be so hard on him to be
. </ I>

195
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:25,226
<i> Where is he?
He ​​can not be far. </ I>

196
00:16:26,722 --> 00:16:28,722
<i> Budzo. </ I>

197
00:16:30,609 --> 00:16:33,828
I'm too tired to stand in the cold...

198
00:16:33,928 --> 00:16:39,134
And cliques to fight, while
Zambezia thicker.

199
00:16:39,135 --> 00:16:43,759
I love leftovers. You see, sir Budzo...

200
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:48,266
We are scavengers.
Yes, we eat carrion.

201
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:50,793
Right Cecil?

202
00:16:50,894 --> 00:16:54,464
But all the things we could do together.

203
00:16:55,975 --> 00:16:59,862
The Maribu's would have
the roots can dominate.

204
00:16:59,962 --> 00:17:02,387
We are actually more a duo.

205
00:17:02,487 --> 00:17:04,973
We have it all worked out.
So...

206
00:17:05,073 --> 00:17:07,939
A trio, yes, that's better.

207
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,854
Strength in numbers. Cooperation.

208
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:14,703
Think about everything that you
so long denied.

209
00:17:14,803 --> 00:17:18,208
Good food, good nests.

210
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:21,365
It is time that kingdom for yourself to take.

211
00:17:21,465 --> 00:17:26,480
In order to rule on Zambezia.
- With a parliamentary system?

212
00:17:26,887 --> 00:17:30,965
A coup.
That sounds good.

213
00:17:31,066 --> 00:17:37,228
I take only a small share of the spoils.

214
00:17:37,229 --> 00:17:42,822
Finally, how many eggs can a lizard eat
?

215
00:17:42,923 --> 00:17:46,411
Collect all Maribu's.

216
00:17:46,512 --> 00:17:49,918
Tell them that night they should work.

217
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:53,850
Nights are not good for me.
- I, as ruler?

218
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,950
I like to sleep.

219
00:17:56,857 --> 00:18:00,518
Imagine the possibilities.

220
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:06,690
The pah, the prestige...
- The pudding.

221
00:18:06,891 --> 00:18:10,003
No? Would not it help?

222
00:18:10,311 --> 00:18:12,311
He's gone.

223
00:18:16,551 --> 00:18:22,734
Look at that. The great Tendai.
It's us.

224
00:18:26,132 --> 00:18:30,784
Training you or something?
This is heavy cardio sport.

225
00:18:30,785 --> 00:18:34,214
Morning I do not eat much, you know.

226
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:38,252
Go into the slipstream fly. Go.

227
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:45,253
This is cool.

228
00:18:45,295 --> 00:18:48,950
It is easier to get there, right?

229
00:19:23,994 --> 00:19:27,822
Kai, we are there.
- That big old tree?

230
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:31,330
That's Zambezia.
- Where is the city?

231
00:19:31,431 --> 00:19:34,491
Make jokes but, countryside bird.

232
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,920
Hey, your beak hanging open.

233
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:26,538
Job free for the landing.
- I'm coming.

234
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:29,374
Babies on board.
- I know her.

235
00:20:30,254 --> 00:20:36,753
Gogo lands.
All hands on deck.

236
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:43,368
Crazy people. I need a cracker.

237
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,330
Stay close to me, we're going to land.

238
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:58,598
<i> Seagulls have delayed
get and 15 minutes later. </ I>

239
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:01,787
Here you get value for your money.

240
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:05,623
<i> The yellow zone is only
for students and owls. </ I>

241
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:09,978
Five children. One, two,
three, I miss a child.

242
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:14,232
Gogo, wait.
Thanks for the lift, Pavi.

243
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,153
Enjoy the big city.
We'll see you at the Spring Festival.

244
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,431
Careful with my eggs.

245
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:26,144
Watch where you fly, fly
is prohibited.

246
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:30,498
Sorry.
- Welcome in Zambezia.

247
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:34,994
The famous bird city.
Have you anything to declare?

248
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:38,323
I certify that this great city.
- Your name, sir?

249
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:40,967
Kai. Ouch, what are you doing?

250
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:44,469
It's just a small sample
, standard.

251
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,248
Dodo, give it to the school office off.

252
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:51,628
If you are looking for accommodation can I Mushana's proposals?

253
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:56,244
And if you need a guide...
- Stadsbezichtingen.

254
00:21:56,344 --> 00:21:59,104
Okay, write me at.
- One more question.

255
00:21:59,204 --> 00:22:02,989
You do not have a spring.
- No, no.

256
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:07,277
How long do you stay here?
- I do not know.

257
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:18,880
I think forever.
- Inhabitants, congratulations.

258
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,899
Citizen?
- You're the emigration.

259
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:23,644
I did it.
I am a real Zambeziër.

260
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,744
A Zambeziaan.

261
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,734
A Zambo...
I am one of you.

262
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:34,187
And where should the tire?
Here?

263
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:37,231
Good.

264
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:42,136
Perhaps the caterer
eating here drop.

265
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:45,721
Let the weaver birds here the flowers go?

266
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:48,534
Zoe?

267
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:52,121
Sorry. It sounds good.
- Which part?

268
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,275
All. I think we should do so.

269
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:58,127
You did not listen, do you?

270
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:01,030
The Spring Festival is the same every year, dad.

271
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,820
You do the
details to worry.

272
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,574
It is great.

273
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:08,496
It is great because we
us worry about the details.

274
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:12,308
Master Sekhuru, a new resident.

275
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:16,646
Thanks, Dodo.

276
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:21,435
It's a while since we had a falcon in Zambezia.

277
00:23:21,535 --> 00:23:25,263
He's here for the audition
of the Hurricanes. That is tomorrow.

278
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:29,851
Wild you get to the team up?
- I, a Hurricane?

279
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:33,813
Who wants to fly abroad,
I've got too much to do.

280
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,941
We need to plan a party, right?
- You're probably right.

281
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:40,526
Besides, I'm happy under your wings.

282
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:45,441
Who cares for whom?
- Sekhuru, you'll never guess who I just saw.

283
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:47,452
Not in a million years.

284
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:51,998
Council, council, I can tell you.
Okay, I'll tell you.

285
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,098
Hello, Zoe.

286
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:57,028
Do not worry,
Gogo, I was just going.

287
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:01,899
You'll never guess.
- Was the Tendai?

288
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:06,304
What? How did you know?
- Because his son has just arrived.

289
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:10,283
How do you know so much?
You never go anywhere.

290
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:13,644
Where is he?
- Far from civilization.

291
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:19,400
It's called  Kathungu. With his son Kai.
- Kai has followed you here, it seems.

292
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,504
And Tendai? Do you think he is?

293
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:26,991
He was still angry, Sekhuru.

294
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:30,578
I think we will not see
provisionally.

295
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:34,374
Kai is perhaps
looking for answers.

296
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:38,214
Will you tell him?
- No, I promised.

297
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:41,965
But if there is a reason for Tendai
to come back...

298
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:48,554
Would be to pick up his son.
We wait and hope.

299
00:24:50,063 --> 00:24:52,783
<b> Mushana's,
your place in the sun. </ B>

300
00:24:52,967 --> 00:24:54,967
Do you work here?

301
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:58,980
How are you? Excuse me, sorry.
- Looking nest for the night?

302
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,617
You again?

303
00:25:00,717 --> 00:25:05,421
Only number 87 is still free.
The double-deluxe suite.

304
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,630
I'll take him.

305
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:13,304
Okay, where is it? Double-luxurious.

306
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:17,517
Here it is. The large.
The-luxury.

307
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:21,062
Here I can get used to it.

308
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,674
Hi, okay, I think we can share...

309
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:26,134
You too?

310
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:27,427
All of you?
- The bed is so...

311
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:30,029
The whole family?
- Feathered.

312
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:31,722
We're all in this together.

313
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:33,072
It is the double-deluxe.

314
00:25:33,172 --> 00:25:35,565
Look, they have peppermint
on the pillow.

315
00:25:35,665 --> 00:25:37,665
This is not peppermint.

316
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:48,881
Ezee, night tours...

317
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,175
Now exclusively daytime.

318
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:56,681
Nest 87. Is there a Mr. Kai present?

319
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:59,600
Mr. Kai sleeps.

320
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:03,071
Okay, poultry, out.
Hurry up, I have work to do.

321
00:26:03,171 --> 00:26:04,922
Can I check-out later?

322
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:09,719
Welcome to Ezee Nocturnal Tours.
Now the safety...

323
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:11,637
Exclusive daytime.

324
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,265
Can you come back later?
- You ordered the tour.

325
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:18,019
Yes, but not at dawn.
- Actually you have done that, man.

326
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:21,604
Read the small print.
- Okay, who's that?

327
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:25,651
I am. I made it myself.
Are you jealous?

328
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:28,896
The name Ezee. Ezee is the company.

329
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:32,133
What brings you to Zambezia?

330
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:36,591
I had a change of scenery, I think.

331
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:40,517
Marvel.
For there is no better place than this.

332
00:26:40,617 --> 00:26:42,273
I do not remember your name.
- It Ezee.

333
00:26:42,373 --> 00:26:43,994
Beautiful, what is it?
- Ezee.

334
00:26:44,094 --> 00:26:47,392
You do not get me to rub,
I'm new here. - My name Ezee.

335
00:26:47,492 --> 00:26:49,789
Do you do all day?
- I hope not.

336
00:26:49,889 --> 00:26:52,236
I am Kai from Kathungu.

337
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:56,440
Never heard of it.
But you now comes from Zambezia.

338
00:26:56,449 --> 00:27:00,444
Time to the city on the
Ezee way to discover.

339
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:40,494
Countryside Bird, you know
how long we've been working on?

340
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:43,146
Sorry, let us get carried away, you know.

341
00:28:43,246 --> 00:28:46,123
Ezee  showed me the city
view. Ezee on the way.

342
00:28:46,223 --> 00:28:48,311
Just what we need, another Ezee.

343
00:28:48,411 --> 00:28:50,015
I'm not Ezee, I am Kai.

344
00:28:50,115 --> 00:28:52,632
Give him some space,
he is new in town.

345
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:56,927
As you take it easy
did the weaver birds and I were at work.

346
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:59,305
I must say, it was fun, but...

347
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,098
We must continue with the tour.

348
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,746
Should not we stay and the nice young lady...

349
00:29:03,846 --> 00:29:05,439
Help? What's her name?

350
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:08,294
Believe me, the longer we stay,

351
00:29:08,394 --> 00:29:12,304
the more damage we cause. Let's go.

352
00:29:12,593 --> 00:29:15,838
I prefer frozen.

353
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,824
I mean, you got the worm first wash.
And then she says...

354
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,351
Spot not my voice. And I say,

355
00:29:20,451 --> 00:29:22,370
I'm a mockingbird,
I can not help it.

356
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,971
You're not a mockingbird.
- A third of my mother's side though.

357
00:29:26,071 --> 00:29:29,935
About  mother speaking...

358
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:34,841
The island of milk and babies.
- Fly on, little bird.

359
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:39,195
Or just go to the side, so I...

360
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:44,321
Handsome young falcon can see.
Who's your new friend?

361
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:48,854
Shake with that tail.
- I knew it, my friend.

362
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,954
You bring me luck.

363
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:19,151
Are the Hurricanes?
- Yeah, boy the Hurricanes.

364
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:23,639
The wildest birds in the air,
I've learned all my movements.

365
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:26,392
Gogo was right. They are great.

366
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:30,371
No, you're in Zambezia.

367
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:36,293
Here we say great. Try it.
- Amazing.

368
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:39,137
There is still hope for you, friend.

369
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:52,643
Excuse me, to hear, to hear.

370
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:57,523
Collecting boys.
Nigel, you too.

371
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:01,026
Beaks closed, ears open.

372
00:31:01,456 --> 00:31:05,734
Friends, strays, Maribu's...

373
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:11,145
Zambezianen  when gathered, they created a
inside...

374
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:14,206
Inside.
- And outside.

375
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:16,579
Outside.
- If you had not noticed...

376
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:19,329
We are on the outside.
- Here we are.

377
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:24,808
In the cold, desolate, outside.
- In the cold Africa.

378
00:31:24,984 --> 00:31:27,486
And why?
- I do not know. That is a mystery.

379
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:30,785
Because they did not like our appearance.

380
00:31:31,073 --> 00:31:33,250
What is wrong with our appearance?

381
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:38,080
They want the tree house all to themselves
. How sporty is that?

382
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,399
Very sporty.
- Not really.

383
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,676
No, sorry.
- Not really. In my book.

384
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:47,807
And that's exactly why we should accept the proposal
of Budzo.

385
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:51,101
Since when are Maribu's servants
of a lizard. - He's got a point.

386
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:56,749
We work together with Budzo, idiot.
Not for him.

387
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,852
We are partners in this great undertaking.

388
00:31:59,952 --> 00:32:00,952
Yes, teamwork.

389
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:03,647
We help Budzo on the island to get
and we share...

390
00:32:03,747 --> 00:32:07,801
All good things.

391
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:11,788
Yes, I get hungry when I think of it.

392
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:16,769
Question. Would those Hurricanes
be a problem?

393
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:19,672
Hurricanes?
- Make him not to laugh.

394
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:23,901
Budzo possesses unrivaled brute force.

395
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,678
So we need help.

396
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:30,324
A new wind blowing through this valley
.

397
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:33,118
A wind of change.

398
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:37,581
Good impact. Give another.

399
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,250
Take it.

400
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:49,843
Boys anyway.
Worthless.

401
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:03,930
Does that door the prescribed weight?
I swear it smaller.

402
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:08,137
Hurricanes ready.
- How to become a Hurricane?

403
00:33:08,237 --> 00:33:10,639
Have you not seen the posters? She hung everywhere.

404
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,739
Which posters?
- This.

405
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:20,040
I should have hung.
- Hurricane audition today?

406
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:23,798
Where?
- On the southwestern platform...

407
00:33:24,126 --> 00:33:26,460
Man, just take a
poster. If you hurry...

408
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,741
You on time. Say that Ezee you send.

409
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:30,403
You know what, let's say that you do not know me.

410
00:33:30,503 --> 00:33:32,295
Maybe you should not mention my name
.

411
00:33:32,395 --> 00:33:34,698
Forget it. Hey, nuts.

412
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:38,934
And that recruits, the race field.

413
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:42,121
I told you he would not come.
He ​​is too busy to take it easy.

414
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:45,357
Racers ready.

415
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:50,237
Burger, this is forbidden.

416
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:52,950
Only Hurricanes and new recruits are allowed.

417
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:57,853
But I'm here to take the test to explain.
- Your name is not on my list.

418
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:01,127
Can you not set up?
- No, I'm sorry.

419
00:34:01,227 --> 00:34:07,780
The rules state that no tenders
done, after the designated...

420
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,660
Look at that, just in time.
Fortunately for you, I love punctuality.

421
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,101
Go stand in line.

422
00:34:14,201 --> 00:34:17,665
You have the entire process
accountable and back.

423
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:22,686
If you do not make it, you fail.
On your mark.

424
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:26,023
Ready. Beginning.

425
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:31,487
<i> And there they go. </ I>

426
00:34:38,803 --> 00:34:43,818
<i> with firm braking
they fly straight into the first. </ I>

427
00:34:48,896 --> 00:34:51,924
<i> Gondo, shoot away from the group. </ i>

428
00:34:55,969 --> 00:35:01,391
<i> next, my personal favorite,
the chicane. </ i>

429
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:11,108
Excuse me.

430
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:14,000
<i> Gondo still has the lead. </ I>

431
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:36,677
<i> Now comes the infamous tornado tunnel test. </ I>

432
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:21,096
This is my friend.

433
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:25,432
Come on, Kai.

434
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:35,039
<i> They go into the vertical track. </ I>

435
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:02,387
<i> The first is, Kai. </ I>

436
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:07,824
The small falcon. I can not believe it.
Where did he come from?

437
00:37:09,937 --> 00:37:13,632
The've met the selection, recruit.
Your movements are unorthodox.

438
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:18,528
You improvise, you think creatively,
I do not like that.

439
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:22,641
But you can be proud, a Hurricane,
recruit to be.

440
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:27,926
Recruit? I am not a Hurricane?
- That's the spirit.

441
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,483
It takes more than a race...

442
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:32,190
To join...

443
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:36,338
Of the most elite racing power of the world.

444
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:44,596
Well done, Kai.
We expect a lot from you, young falcon.

445
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:46,582
I will not disappoint you, sir.

446
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:50,852
Me? No, Kai, set Zambezia not disappoint.

447
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:57,109
Zambezia always comes first.
Remember that.

448
00:37:57,317 --> 00:38:03,015
I love watching you, fast guy.
We go at dawn maribupatrioulle.

449
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:08,870
You better go to sleep. Recruits
sleep down there.

450
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:14,082
Arise.

451
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:22,718
Budzo.
- Comfortable, old friend?

452
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:28,223
It's nice to see a familiar face.

453
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:34,730
To be honest, you look stressed.

454
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:37,007
I Zambezia long ago.

455
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:41,137
I just want my son
get and go home.

456
00:38:41,237 --> 00:38:43,872
I'm no threat to you.

457
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:48,303
There is still fighting spirit in you.

458
00:38:48,338 --> 00:38:51,738
I see it, even if you can not.

459
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:55,442
And that's good, because you'll need it
.

460
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:58,378
You will see me in good stead.

461
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:04,701
We received the message that the Maribu's upstream active.

462
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:09,206
We will in sector six patrol
and there in sector seven.

463
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:12,768
Apparently this is a big swamp.

464
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:14,056
This is a stain.

465
00:39:14,156 --> 00:39:17,214
Who has a stain on my card made?

466
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:22,819
We concentrate our eyes and our ears look good on.

467
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:26,274
I mean, watch out caps
and our ears...

468
00:39:26,374 --> 00:39:28,669
Where they should be.

469
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:30,909
Torn.

470
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:34,919
Beware, Hurricanes.

471
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:45,944
Can we help you, ma'am?
- My Neville floats down the river.

472
00:39:45,975 --> 00:39:48,846
I would recommend against dangerous currents.

473
00:39:48,946 --> 00:39:50,831
Why I can not catch him.
- I am obliged...

474
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:53,693
By city regulations,
concerning the rescue...

475
00:39:53,793 --> 00:39:56,169
A minor,
permission.

476
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:59,815
He is not a minor, he is my husband.

477
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:03,276
Hurricanes, rescue mission.

478
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:06,800
Recruit, that's not the right direction.

479
00:40:13,295 --> 00:40:17,120
A crocodile, two alligator, three alligator...

480
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:25,632
Crocodile Six, seven crocodile, crocodile
eight... gotcha.

481
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:34,590
Thank God. If you give me that again call at
.

482
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:35,792
Hug me.

483
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,892
Good news, is not it?

484
00:40:39,563 --> 00:40:43,717
He came like a stone falling from the sky.
- The rookie has skills.

485
00:40:43,817 --> 00:40:46,367
You gotta learn that movement.

486
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,570
Attention.

487
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:54,035
I will keep you alert.
I'm coming.

488
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:58,658
Hey, buddy. This is my size.
The star of heaven.

489
00:40:58,758 --> 00:41:02,419
Get out, uk.
- Where's the captain?

490
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:06,156
Do you have a license for this party?
The music is not according to specifications.

491
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:09,911
And the pleasure zone behind the yellow line.

492
00:41:10,594 --> 00:41:14,931
Ezikiel, what are you doing here?

493
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:20,520
I'm with him, sir.
- Really? Recruit, is this your friend?

494
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:25,025
Evacuation Procedures.

495
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:28,428
Come on, friends. This need not be so?

496
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:32,699
So won, so clotted.

497
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:41,028
<i> Birds from every nation,
get together for lentecelebratie... </ i>

498
00:41:41,363 --> 00:41:44,127
<i> That rhymes. </ I>

499
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:51,095
<i>  Come on everyone, this is a mix to be mixed
. </ I>

500
00:41:51,365 --> 00:41:55,020
<i> Do not be shy, we are all friends. </ I>

501
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:58,250
<i> Slide to Please,
we have limited space. </ i>

502
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:01,155
Always striking coming, huh?

503
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:05,090
I'm sorry about last,
I am more accustomed to open spaces.

504
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:09,945
Then you are at the wrong party.
Where's your wingman?

505
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,193
It's a long story.

506
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:17,410
Only one day Hurricane
and he rescues a bird.

507
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:20,789
True?
- I'm just a recruit.

508
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:25,110
Gogo, I need to ask you something.
How do you know my father?

509
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,821
Long story.
- Gogo, tell me.

510
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:32,576
Silent now. listen to Sekhuru.
- I want to welcome...

511
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:36,888
You all, in
Spring Festival this year.

512
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:42,269
Together we celebrate the future generations of Zambezia.

513
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:47,274
Grab any weefvogel.

514
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,913
Gotcha.
- Good men, we have them.

515
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:56,783
Weefvogels, let the flowers go.

516
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:05,345
Here's something wrong.
The weefvogels never miss the signal.

517
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:09,629
Maribu's.

518
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,175
Tini.

519
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:16,202
Gogo, save the babies.

520
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:20,269
<i> Not panic, the Hurricanes will get them. </ I>

521
00:43:20,304 --> 00:43:23,560
Tini.

522
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,778
Stay in formation.
- They escape.

523
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:28,813
Wear them away.

524
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,940
No.

525
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:36,323
If you come closer let me...
Oh, jeez.

526
00:43:38,408 --> 00:43:40,408
What are you doing?

527
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:50,712
Tini.

528
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:54,742
I will bring them to the last feather pluck.

529
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:58,676
Come on.

530
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:05,585
You have guts.
We will not do anything anyway.

531
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:08,605
We will never...
Tendai?

532
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:11,007
Tini?
- Do you know who that is?

533
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:15,136
You're dumber than I thought.
- What a big bill, do not you, Cecil?

534
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:20,081
She keeps talking and does not stop.
She goes on.

535
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:23,353
They should always have the last word.

536
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:26,039
Well, well.

537
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:31,319
Cecil, I'll be honest,
I did not think that you would succeed.

538
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:36,299
Exactly, yes. And now what?

539
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:38,522
Shall we weefvogels
a few coats to weave?

540
00:44:38,622 --> 00:44:43,889
Now they Budzo bridge and weaving.

541
00:44:43,924 --> 00:44:48,561
For you? Never.
- Cecil, the weefvogels rebel.

542
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:51,745
Do you see him? A double meaning.

543
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:55,635
Naughty thieves.
Their kind will never change.

544
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:58,430
My dear little Tini.
- They started.

545
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:01,648
Now we finish it.
- They're still angry...

546
00:45:01,748 --> 00:45:04,469
That they were excluded from the founding of the city.

547
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:09,983
Many years ago.
I never thought that she would humiliate themselves to this.

548
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:12,877
An interesting situation.

549
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:16,840
You need some motivation.

550
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:20,135
And I get hungry.
- No.

551
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:22,662
No, wait.
- Do not listen to him, Tini.

552
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:25,332
Leave him alone. We will do it.

553
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:27,417
Make sure the bridge is strong enough...

554
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:31,438
To get me on that island.

555
00:45:33,612 --> 00:45:38,457
Time for desserts.
- Wait, he gets a dessert?

556
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,889
I would also like pudding.

557
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:44,492
Chocolate perhaps with a cherry...

558
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:48,480
Our first priority is the
weefvogels unharmed back.

559
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:53,251
Our actions should not be guided by blind rage.

560
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:59,032
What would you have me do, Sekhuru?
- The Maribu are sloppy, yes.

561
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:04,537
Uncivilized, of course, but they have never
such devious actions.

562
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:09,307
Maybe insert a bigger plan behind.
- A reconnaissance mission. Confirmed.

563
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:13,912
Hurricanes ready.
No, no, not you, fast guy.

564
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:15,340
You need every bird that...

565
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,385
By your action
was almost a basket with weefvogels slain.

566
00:46:18,485 --> 00:46:20,865
So you stay here, sir.

567
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:24,766
Let's see if you can handle
cleaning service.

568
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:28,521
Featherweight.
- He better stay behind.

569
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:32,524
It is truly a tragedy.
- A drama? Tell me about it.

570
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:35,906
It's not safe.
Let's take yellow today.

571
00:46:36,006 --> 00:46:37,112
Yellow?

572
00:46:37,212 --> 00:46:41,616
It's like I told Larry, who
Maribu's, yuck dirty.

573
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:44,786
You can not trust them.
- No, my cousin is married one.

574
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:49,561
He went off with their eggs.
- I'm not surprised.

575
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:58,399
How about some help?

576
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:04,931
They call that help,
where you come from?

577
00:47:05,782 --> 00:47:11,477
I am a night hawk. I have both eyes
sight of a hawk.

578
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:14,509
In the night. It was a mess.

579
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:17,544
Hi Ezee. How is it, friends?

580
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:21,823
It is, 'how are you' and 'my friend'.
- Sorry, mate.

581
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:27,178
I had to stand up for you.
- No, you seemed confused.

582
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:32,000
Did you know Hurricanes free food?
- The recruits also?

583
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,376
How about a snack?

584
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:36,137
Do you by me a
sticky moth to give...

585
00:47:36,237 --> 00:47:38,148
I'll get back with open arms?

586
00:47:38,248 --> 00:47:40,248
How about two?

587
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:46,948
Welcome back.
I thought you were gone forever.

588
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:50,981
I knew you did not in
might abandon.

589
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:56,566
This is the Ezee. You said that you
nocturnal excursions kept?

590
00:47:56,666 --> 00:47:58,676
I can not believe you me here...

591
00:47:58,776 --> 00:48:00,987
've Brought.
I am allergic to danger.

592
00:48:01,087 --> 00:48:03,547
We would nevertheless only a
look? I had...

593
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:05,950
Can know that you're a
magnet makes me.

594
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:08,887
Zoe.
- It works now al

595
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:13,238
Kai, you're grounded.
You can not be here.

596
00:48:13,338 --> 00:48:15,084
Moreover, you will get lost.

597
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:19,439
I think think she likes you, friend.
- No.

598
00:48:19,606 --> 00:48:22,467
I get it,
there anyone here wants to be a Hurricane.

599
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:26,679
I fly here often.
- Because you want to be a Hurricane.

600
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:29,724
That will never happen.
- You are now on a mission.

601
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:34,812
Come on, the night vision of Ezee
we will find weefvogels.

602
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,165
Do you hear that?

603
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:41,878
Of course I heard him,
I have night hearing.

604
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:45,173
Do you see anything?
- No, nothing.

605
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:49,546
Only a couple of trees, stones
and a bunch Maribu's.

606
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:52,428
Maribu's.

607
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:56,668
Still, you know what "concealed" means?

608
00:48:56,768 --> 00:48:58,941
That I
home under the blankets should lie.

609
00:48:59,041 --> 00:49:00,505
I can not hear what they say.

610
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:03,758
That's because we're too far away.

611
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:07,946
Do not go.
Yes, he goes to them.

612
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:16,368
This is not a look.

613
00:49:16,496 --> 00:49:18,398
Kai, we need help.

614
00:49:18,498 --> 00:49:19,792
At work, guys.

615
00:49:19,892 --> 00:49:22,652
The weefvogels have
more grass.

616
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:25,655
Have you heard Cecil?
- Tini lives.

617
00:49:25,755 --> 00:49:29,835
Yes, I look at you, Nigel.
You eat our bridge.

618
00:49:29,926 --> 00:49:32,053
Cecil. Hello.

619
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:36,808
The boys and I do it, but I have a concern
...

620
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:41,546
Big lizard can we trust?
He ​​is cold blooded and so.

621
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:45,300
That's not good for the circulation.
- Stop whining.

622
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,236
I am too far to reverse.

623
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:51,055
Good enough, it was just a suggestion.

624
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:53,505
Just a
overwhelming feeling of danger,

625
00:49:53,605 --> 00:49:55,327
that's all. Forget it.

626
00:49:55,427 --> 00:49:58,563
We should call the Hurricanes.
- After this, I'm there.

627
00:49:58,663 --> 00:50:03,423
I'll stay here as a backup,
because my knees are locked.

628
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:07,906
Who is that?
Stop playing games.

629
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:10,006
My Friend?

630
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:15,402
Ezee, are you okay?
Come on, Ezee.

631
00:50:15,972 --> 00:50:18,725
You must stay with us, buddy.

632
00:50:19,017 --> 00:50:24,380
Tell my mother I love her.
- We gotta get him out of here.

633
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,305
What the hell does he eat?
- What he does not eat?

634
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:31,237
I get help. Stay here.

635
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:13,277
Tini?

636
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:18,376
Fly at the first chance you get away.
Do not worry about me.

637
00:51:18,476 --> 00:51:21,911
What is this chatter?
So we do not...

638
00:51:22,011 --> 00:51:25,149
Where I come from.
Where you come from.

639
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:28,563
We'll find a way to escape.

640
00:51:28,663 --> 00:51:29,654
We all do.

641
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:33,091
Let the beast angry.

642
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:38,569
Less talk, more weaving.
Do you want your friend to see a sign?

643
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:43,793
You and you, I have a job for you.
Come with me.

644
00:51:43,893 --> 00:51:46,775
If you do not care, I work for Cecil...

645
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:49,757
And
I would like to hear what Cecil has to say.

646
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:52,235
I think it's good.
- There you have it. We go.

647
00:51:52,335 --> 00:51:56,347
If Budzo on that island is
nothing can stop him.

648
00:51:56,447 --> 00:52:01,561
We'll find a way. Kai and the rest of the
Hurricanes are looking for us.

649
00:52:01,661 --> 00:52:05,123
My son is a Hurricane?

650
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:09,569
You'll never be a Hurricane.
- Listen to what we have discovered.

651
00:52:09,669 --> 00:52:10,669
The weefvogels ..

652
00:52:10,769 --> 00:52:12,819
Last night You have so many rules broken...

653
00:52:12,919 --> 00:52:15,517
I have no form
long enough.

654
00:52:15,617 --> 00:52:16,617
They make something...

655
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:20,361
Since you have no notion of what a team is
...

656
00:52:20,461 --> 00:52:23,891
Can not be part of our team.

657
00:52:32,867 --> 00:52:37,457
This is a crazy idea.
With certainty insane.

658
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:47,456
Maribu's. An invasion of Maribu's.

659
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:53,963
Hurricanes.

660
00:53:12,023 --> 00:53:18,058
The next time someone 'stoop' says
may be a warning.

661
00:53:18,571 --> 00:53:22,650
This intensive care is intense.
- I see someone feel better.

662
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:28,706
Another cramp. Hi friend.
That's fine. What a pain.

663
00:53:29,207 --> 00:53:33,372
I think he now
frequently injured will be.

664
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:37,490
Sorry about the Hurricanes,
I know how much it meant to you.

665
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:39,841
I guess I'm just so used to fly
,

666
00:53:39,941 --> 00:53:41,310
I have hurt the team.

667
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:44,205
We're in the same boat.
I'm in trouble.

668
00:53:44,305 --> 00:53:49,252
Yes, but I'm from the Hurricanes kicked.
You do not know how that feels.

669
00:53:49,352 --> 00:53:54,173
You're right. How would I know.
Sorry I got you last night delayed.

670
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:57,218
No one asked you to come.
- Anytime.

671
00:53:57,318 --> 00:54:02,140
I can not believe how sensitive everyone.
- Maybe "everyone" is not the problem.

672
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,065
My friend do not leave me,
I'm feverish.

673
00:54:06,244 --> 00:54:08,663
Excuse me, which one of you
has ordered a massage?

674
00:54:08,763 --> 00:54:14,152
How many jobs have you got?
- I do not like being in a pigeonholed.

675
00:54:14,252 --> 00:54:18,552
There you are. Come, Kai.
- Gogo Sorry, I'm leaving.

676
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:23,361
You can not go now, Tini needs you.
Zambezia needs you.

677
00:54:23,461 --> 00:54:25,988
Zambezia and I can not get along, Gogo.

678
00:54:26,088 --> 00:54:29,667
My father was right,
I do not belong here.

679
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:32,895
I do not have time for this nonsense.

680
00:54:33,104 --> 00:54:36,232
Let me go crazy stork.

681
00:54:36,508 --> 00:54:41,693
Do not lose them, Hurricanes.
- Make sure they do not lose.

682
00:54:56,969 --> 00:55:00,072
It's a trap.
- Too late to warn.

683
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:05,386
Beautiful movement, old friend.
- Yes, a good show.

684
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:08,994
Gogo, let me go.
I should never have come here.

685
00:55:09,094 --> 00:55:11,094
My father would...

686
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:15,602
Sekhuru, no more secrets.
Tell the child the story.

687
00:55:15,702 --> 00:55:18,716
Or do you want history to repeat itself?

688
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:23,279
Yes, maybe it's time.
- Time for what?

689
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:29,410
That you come to know the truth.
Here you born.

690
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:34,123
Wait, am I in Zambezia born?

691
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:40,880
Welcome home, Kai. Come.

692
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:56,018
What is this?

693
00:55:58,356 --> 00:56:02,026
Daddy?
- And?

694
00:56:02,193 --> 00:56:04,193
My mother.

695
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:07,531
Amai.
- Do they live here?

696
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:12,003
They have together founded the Hurricanes.
To Zambezia monitor...

697
00:56:12,103 --> 00:56:16,691
And protection of all birds in the river valley.

698
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:19,086
What happened to her?

699
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:22,671
Killer, she was my wife.

700
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:26,784
You're not still mad about that one little...

701
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:29,604
Thing that happened that one time.

702
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:36,352
It's just what I do.

703
00:56:37,103 --> 00:56:40,381
You could say that it is my nature.

704
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:43,359
When nature calls, I answer.

705
00:56:45,128 --> 00:56:49,990
Move, weefvogels.
We go from this valley...

706
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:53,411
A great omelet.

707
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:58,749
Monster.
- Thank you. I do what I can.

708
00:57:02,837 --> 00:57:05,308
We got a nest against,
by a iguana...

709
00:57:05,408 --> 00:57:07,074
Budzo named, was attacked.

710
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:08,701
Your mother fought bravely.

711
00:57:08,801 --> 00:57:14,473
I lost a wing,
but she gave her life.

712
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:18,561
We can save the day an egg.

713
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:23,883
And that was me. If she had not been there,
I would not be here.

714
00:57:23,983 --> 00:57:25,983
Zoe?

715
00:57:27,153 --> 00:57:30,531
Now I understand your interest in Kai.

716
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:35,770
That was only a part of.
I recognize a good talent when I see it.

717
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:38,939
Why has my father told me this?

718
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:41,400
And why are you telling me this now?

719
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,278
Your father was blinded by grief.

720
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:48,657
He made me promise,
the past forever buried.

721
00:57:48,757 --> 00:57:53,387
So he took me to Kathungu.
Away from it all.

722
00:57:53,596 --> 00:57:57,295
Tendai was the value of
Zambezia not see

723
00:57:57,395 --> 00:57:59,335
just what it had cost.

724
00:57:59,435 --> 00:58:02,463
If you help them...
- Happen good things.

725
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:06,643
That's right, Gogo.
- Is the history lesson is over?

726
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:11,197
I've seen Budzo.
- What, Budzo?

727
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:13,391
Where?
- Last night in the woods.

728
00:58:13,491 --> 00:58:16,852
The lizard was missing a claw.
- I had Maribu's talking about.

729
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:20,573
They work together with fixed Budzo.
- I do not know what they're up to...

730
00:58:20,673 --> 00:58:25,778
But if Maribu's Budzo help
we are in great danger.

731
00:58:25,878 --> 00:58:29,457
That brute can Tini better
with no claw touching.

732
00:58:29,557 --> 00:58:30,609
We must return to the forest.

733
00:58:30,709 --> 00:58:32,368
The Maribu can be flown anywhere
.

734
00:58:32,468 --> 00:58:34,634
But Budzo must have left a trail
...

735
00:58:34,734 --> 00:58:36,539
And that can lead us to the weefvogels.

736
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:40,751
No, it's too dangerous.
Do not know what to expect.

737
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:42,878
We have to wait for the Hurricanes.

738
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:45,690
By that time it may be too late.
- They should be back by now.

739
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:47,241
We should go, dad.

740
00:58:47,341 --> 00:58:49,735
I knew it was risky,
but what choice do we have?

741
00:58:49,835 --> 00:58:54,425
It is as you say,
Zambezia comes in first place.

742
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:58,269
You always want to be up there, right?

743
00:58:58,369 --> 00:59:01,599
I am ready, Father.
I will find them.

744
00:59:02,231 --> 00:59:05,793
Go.
- If you think I'm crazy...

745
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:08,963
You have not seen anything yet.

746
00:59:30,843 --> 00:59:33,112
Do not make a sound.

747
00:59:34,989 --> 00:59:39,810
Are you serious? What was that?
- What? I have old bones.

748
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:43,939
Look.
Lizard Print with claw less.

749
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:48,903
Soon he misses more claws.
- Okay, do a little softer.

750
00:59:49,003 --> 00:59:54,008
Do not worry little Tini,
mom comes to your rescue.

751
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:58,562
Small  Tini.
- Maybe I should first take a look.

752
00:59:58,662 --> 01:00:00,662
Good idea.

753
01:00:11,643 --> 01:00:16,222
It is simply up for grabs.
I am already celebrating.

754
01:00:16,322 --> 01:00:18,180
Where do you think it comes from?

755
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,643
Without us it would be but an empty
tree.

756
01:00:20,743 --> 01:00:23,687
She has a point.
- Of course she has a point.

757
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:27,316
Tini? What is going on?
- It's Budzo.

758
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:30,110
He forced us to make a bridge
so he can come Zambezia.

759
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:33,714
They have a while ago.
- We need them to be.

760
01:00:33,814 --> 01:00:36,575
And your father?
- What's wrong with him?

761
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:38,077
He's here.

762
01:00:38,177 --> 01:00:41,144
I would even take a bath
'n Zambeziaan...

763
01:00:41,244 --> 01:00:43,541
Be. There, I said it.

764
01:00:43,641 --> 01:00:47,294
Of course we can not trust him
I trust myself barely.

765
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:49,394
Daddy.

766
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:50,521
Did you hear that?

767
01:00:50,621 --> 01:00:53,634
I can hear sounds and that was a sound.

768
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:57,805
Go take a look.
- Why do I always look?

769
01:00:57,905 --> 01:01:00,032
Look for yourself.
- Kai's.

770
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:04,915
Okay. You watch, I'll see.
- That's reasonable.

771
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:14,129
Kai, what are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

772
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:18,701
I went after you.
- It's my fault you're in that cage.

773
01:01:18,801 --> 01:01:23,163
I did not have to depart.
- Kai No, you were right to depart.

774
01:01:23,263 --> 01:01:25,499
Sekhuru told me what happened to Mom.

775
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,460
We broke formation to chase an iguana to go.

776
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,560
Sekhuru order to save.

777
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:33,126
We were separated.

778
01:01:33,226 --> 01:01:36,093
I left behind to Amai
Budzo to fight against.

779
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:39,697
Kai, I have robbed you of your mother.

780
01:01:40,489 --> 01:01:42,349
I could not bear the thought.

781
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:45,028
No, Daddy. Budzo me
my mother robbed.

782
01:01:45,128 --> 01:01:46,687
You Sekhuru and Zoe saved.

783
01:01:46,787 --> 01:01:53,247
Zoe  If you encounter you will see it.
You're a hero to everyone. For me.

784
01:01:53,919 --> 01:01:57,404
From my point is you are the hero.

785
01:01:59,967 --> 01:02:01,967
Let's get outta here.

786
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:09,601
Did you hear that?
- Well, you heard it.

787
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:17,526
Tini. Where is my Tini.

788
01:02:17,735 --> 01:02:21,029
Gogo.
- Tini.

789
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:23,949
Tendai. What's he doing here?

790
01:02:24,742 --> 01:02:27,178
Gogo, we try...

791
01:02:29,263 --> 01:02:30,444
That also works.

792
01:02:30,544 --> 01:02:34,363
We go, you have
there a problem with that?

793
01:02:34,752 --> 01:02:39,342
The exit is on the left.
Do not be a stranger.

794
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:10,994
Worms.

795
01:03:40,359 --> 01:03:45,119
Budzo, old comrade,
a beautiful day for a coup.

796
01:03:45,197 --> 01:03:47,474
Consider it a hostile takeover.

797
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:49,574
No, he is al

798
01:03:59,086 --> 01:04:01,891
What is this? You betrayed us.

799
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:06,842
Maribu You are just as naive as the
Zambezianen.

800
01:04:07,678 --> 01:04:09,678
No.

801
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:18,981
Sekhuru, come quickly.
Iguanas in Zambezia.

802
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:21,984
No, impossible.

803
01:04:22,943 --> 01:04:26,258
Gogo, they may not reach the egg.

804
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:32,394
See what you've done.
They will destroy Zambezia and you in it.

805
01:04:32,494 --> 01:04:37,983
Treacherous reptile, that was not part of the plan
. He would be alone.

806
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:41,487
No, Maribu are also birds.
- No birds like us.

807
01:04:41,587 --> 01:04:44,052
Not after what they have done.

808
01:04:49,011 --> 01:04:51,757
Zambezia is more than a
city. It's an idea.

809
01:04:51,857 --> 01:04:54,666
The idea that we are all equally important.

810
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:56,535
Even Maribu's.
- Well said.

811
01:04:56,635 --> 01:04:59,338
If they are willing to help,
they deserve to live here.

812
01:04:59,438 --> 01:05:03,258
We've never trusted.
Why should we start now.

813
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:04,753
Because we no

814
01:05:04,853 --> 01:05:08,423
Zambezianen can call to do that.

815
01:05:09,156 --> 01:05:12,811
We do with you.
Do we do with them?

816
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:14,990
Yes, we do.

817
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:22,665
Grab your eggs now.
- We must work together.

818
01:05:22,711 --> 01:05:25,421
But where are the Hurricanes?
- We are a defenseless target without them.

819
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:28,133
The Hurricanes are coming.

820
01:05:28,342 --> 01:05:31,553
In the meantime, we stand.

821
01:05:31,762 --> 01:05:33,914
And we will do.
- Tendai?

822
01:05:34,014 --> 01:05:36,642
For Zambezia counting on.

823
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:39,060
You came back.

824
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,171
Is there something happened in my absence?

825
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:45,884
I hope you have some fight in you.
- We have more than that.

826
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:48,929
We have Maribu's on our side.

827
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:52,151
We're doomed.

828
01:05:52,252 --> 01:05:55,310
I expected that they would be better to take.

829
01:05:55,410 --> 01:06:01,333
Maribu's we have the bridge hung
and we can detach it again.

830
01:06:08,048 --> 01:06:11,873
Sister. Is there anyone? Hello?
Where is everybody?

831
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:16,685
Is there a party where no one has told me anything about
?

832
01:06:22,396 --> 01:06:25,841
Time to call it a turn
and fly away.

833
01:06:25,941 --> 01:06:27,718
Where you going?

834
01:06:27,818 --> 01:06:30,112
You know what?

835
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:33,599
When I came here
thought I could do everything myself.

836
01:06:33,699 --> 01:06:36,476
And then I saw what Zambezia means.

837
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:39,813
I always say, it is easier together.
- That's right.

838
01:06:39,913 --> 01:06:45,652
That makes this city special.
That makes it worth defending.

839
01:06:45,752 --> 01:06:49,156
The Maribu are now down
because they finally understood.

840
01:06:49,256 --> 01:06:52,659
It's true. They fight for the home team.
- Situation Change.

841
01:06:52,759 --> 01:06:55,846
If we all work together and do our part...

842
01:06:55,946 --> 01:06:58,165
We can win. Do you do that?

843
01:06:58,265 --> 01:07:00,645
Budzo sits in the nest area.

844
01:07:01,268 --> 01:07:05,008
He will address our eggs.
- Find your eggs.

845
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:11,163
Is this not exactly what I want...

846
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:14,656
They lay their eggs in one basket.

847
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:21,371
Budzo, this ends today.
- No bird can me.

848
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:23,833
Well, we'll see.

849
01:07:34,885 --> 01:07:36,885
Daddy.

850
01:07:37,345 --> 01:07:40,215
Well done, son. Show him
get no hold.

851
01:07:40,315 --> 01:07:45,437
This is for my brother, my dear cousin

852
01:07:47,798 --> 01:07:50,442
Cousin, he called me cousin.

853
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:53,848
Well, hold that rope
fixed. Come spanking...

854
01:07:53,948 --> 01:07:56,640
Get it in a decent way.

855
01:07:56,740 --> 01:08:01,328
Target in sight. Stay on course.
Bombs away.

856
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:05,290
Two wanted to go.

857
01:08:19,697 --> 01:08:21,581
No!

858
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:24,059
Yes, yes.

859
01:08:29,106 --> 01:08:31,106
Kai, follow me.

860
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:39,190
'Cousin', stands in the ring.
I tell you what 'hot wings' taste.

861
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:44,479
Okay, say we all have something we
kidding.

862
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:47,958
Your little experiment is over.

863
01:08:48,125 --> 01:08:52,337
This community is a deviation from nature.

864
01:09:07,352 --> 01:09:09,352
Let him go.

865
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:18,155
Daddy.
- Stop them.

866
01:09:20,991 --> 01:09:23,910
Zoe, come back soon.

867
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:27,027
Put ​​your foot down somewhere else.

868
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:32,544
This is not my foot.
- It's the rescue.

869
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:34,196
Is someone there?

870
01:09:34,296 --> 01:09:36,347
Team, execute exercise 26 on my character.

871
01:09:36,447 --> 01:09:39,592
Where are you?
- Three, two, one...

872
01:09:39,718 --> 01:09:41,845
Help.

873
01:09:42,053 --> 01:09:44,598
Help.

874
01:09:46,735 --> 01:09:50,642
Let's hear it.
Higher. Desperate.

875
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:57,056
Where is the rescue?
- That's for you.

876
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:59,721
But you're not even authorized.

877
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:01,948
Oh, I'm gonna fall again.

878
01:10:02,157 --> 01:10:05,435
Budzo have our eggs. It's over.
- Holy crackers...

879
01:10:05,535 --> 01:10:08,827
We live in a cuckoo clock.
- Good Lord.

880
01:10:08,927 --> 01:10:11,506
Do we wait until they do something?
- Think you can handle Budzo?

881
01:10:11,606 --> 01:10:14,205
Do you love us?

882
01:10:14,305 --> 01:10:18,052
Exactly what Kai said,
together we can do anything.

883
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:21,326
You are an inspiration to other birds.

884
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:26,951
I do not know how you do it.
This is a very heavy responsibility.

885
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:48,186
Is this what the mighty
Zambezia has become?

886
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:51,206
Let's see what you got.

887
01:10:57,295 --> 01:11:02,050
I must say, I'm
not very impressed.

888
01:11:02,259 --> 01:11:04,995
If you are my friend bothers me
val tricky.

889
01:11:05,095 --> 01:11:07,985
I shoot a macadamia in your eye.

890
01:11:30,512 --> 01:11:32,580
Take it.

891
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:34,441
Orange is a bit too much.
- Do you?

892
01:11:34,541 --> 01:11:37,903
I would have chosen yellowish green.
- Really?

893
01:11:38,003 --> 01:11:41,740
Why can they weefvogels
so great good weave?

894
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:45,310
Hurricanes, straight.
Target for us.

895
01:11:45,911 --> 01:11:49,615
Three, two, one...
Release.

896
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:12,070
Maribu's on our side?
What the hell?

897
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:17,900
Father.

898
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,503
In the attack.
Drafting.

899
01:12:24,107 --> 01:12:26,487
Save your wings, men.

900
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:35,934
I've had enough of the lizard.
- Perform exercise 46.

901
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:41,733
On my mark. Three, two, one.

902
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:16,768
Kai.
- Zoe.

903
01:13:17,644 --> 01:13:19,644
No.

904
01:13:21,481 --> 01:13:23,481
Help.

905
01:13:25,693 --> 01:13:27,693
Help.

906
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:34,160
Help.

907
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:43,503
Pull on, Kai, pull on.
- I'm not leaving you.

908
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:39,517
My friend.

909
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:58,597
I give him a blow to the heart attack
he has me worried.

910
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:14,093
Just like old times, huh?

911
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:24,087
I hear at the club.
- He's my cousin.

912
01:15:24,187 --> 01:15:30,193
Yes, he is. A very strong bloodline.
- I love watching you.

913
01:15:33,321 --> 01:15:35,446
Your mother would be proud.

914
01:15:36,783 --> 01:15:39,394
I am also proud.
- Thanks Dad.

915
01:15:39,494 --> 01:15:45,166
Daddy, this is Zoe.
- I was the little egg that has saved you.

916
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:49,583
It's an honor to meet you.
- The honor is mine.

917
01:15:56,177 --> 01:16:01,808
Today we can honestly say that no bird...

918
01:16:04,811 --> 01:16:08,523
Isolated.

919
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,705
What is he doing.
- I'm hip.

920
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:27,375
Let the 'funky chicken' call.

921
01:16:27,542 --> 01:16:33,298
This is great.
- No, Daddy amazing.

922
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:47,804
Quality over Quantity (QoQ) ® eleases
Translation Pink Jay ~ Control: Smokey

923
01:17:01,909 --> 01:17:05,253
Look what happens when I garnered my wing.

924
01:17:05,353 --> 01:17:07,774
Beautiful.
- A secret blue color.

925
01:17:07,874 --> 01:17:12,804
Thanks, I call it blauchtig.
- This is the Ezee way.

926
01:17:23,914 --> 01:17:26,225
Pudding. Finally.

927
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:46,172
I fought single-handedly with Budzo
and I was nothing less than...

928
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:48,648
Impressive.

929
01:17:48,748 --> 01:17:50,748
He was impressive.

930
01:17:51,042 --> 01:17:56,057
I look good when I do this, right?
Yes, I do.

931
01:18:19,904 --> 01:18:22,115
A newcomer.

932
01:18:27,161 --> 01:18:29,956
Hello, would you like a snack?

933
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:32,164
How about two?
