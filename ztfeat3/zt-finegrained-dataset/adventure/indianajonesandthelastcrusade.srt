1
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,534
Dismount!

2
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,876
Herman's horse-sick!

3
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,385
Chaps, no one wander off.

4
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:20,348
Some of the passageways
in here can run for miles.

5
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:33,319
I don't think
this is such a good idea.

6
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,200
What is it?

7
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,227
Alfred, did you get anything yet?

8
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,770
Nothing.
Then keep digging.

9
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,814
The kid's got something!

10
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,526
I got something, Garth!
I got something...

11
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,361
I got something right here.

12
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,411
Oh, look at that!

13
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,330
We're rich! We're rich!
Shut up. Shut up.

14
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,499
Well, we're rich, ain't we?

15
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,836
Indy...

16
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:33,963
Indy?

17
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,549
What are they doing?

18
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,093
Indiana? Indiana?

19
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,308
Hey, we got to find
more stuff to bring back.

20
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,436
It's the Cross of Coronado.

21
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,480
Cortez gave it to him in 1520.

22
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,815
Oh, boy!

23
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,818
I'm thinkin' about
raisin' my dead mama, dig down

24
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,820
and put it on her bony finger!

25
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,991
That cross is an important artifact.
It belongs in a museum.

26
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,452
Run back and find the others.

27
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,996
Tell Mr. Havelock
that there are men looting in the caves.

28
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,581
Have him bring the sheriff.

29
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,249
It's only a snake.

30
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,834
Did you hear what I said?

31
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,419
Right. Run back...

32
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,671
Mr. Havelock... The sheriff...

33
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,757
What, what are you gonna do?

34
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,300
I don't know.

35
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,926
I'll think of something.

36
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,893
Dig with your hands,
not with your mouth.

37
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,409
He's got our thing!

38
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,203
Get him!
Get off me!

39
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,877
Mr. Havelock! Anybody!

40
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,254
Everybody's lost but me.

41
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,882
There he is! Let's go! Let's go!

42
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,567
Hey! Hey, you!
Dang it!

43
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,698
Hey! Come back here!

44
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,589
Come on! Get him!

45
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,558
Hey, come back here!

46
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,500
Here, let me.

47
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,123
Holy smokes!

48
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,357
Come on, kid.

49
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,820
There's no way out of this.

50
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,833
Hey!

51
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,021
Toss up the whip.

52
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,616
You got heart, kid,
but that belongs to me.

53
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,118
It belongs to Coronado.

54
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,537
Coronado is dead,
and so are all of his grandchildren.

55
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,040
This should be in a museum.

56
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,791
Now give it back!

57
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,796
A snake! Snake!

58
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,132
Don't let him get away!

59
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,468
Magic?

60
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,596
Hold it.

61
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,473
Make sure he doesn't double back.

62
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,658
Okay, kid, out of the box, now.

63
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,369
Son of a...

64
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,174
Damn.

65
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,686
Dad!

66
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:07,940
Dad!

67
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,734
Dad.

68
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,320
Dad...
Out.

69
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,864
It's important.
Then wait. Count to 20.

70
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,450
No, Dad. You listen to me.
Junior!

71
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:19,868
One, two, three, four...

72
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,745
In Greek.

73
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:38,971
"May he who illuminated this,
illuminate me."

74
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,937
I brought the sheriff.

75
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,149
Just the man I want to see.

76
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,400
Now, there were five or six of them...

77
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,985
It's all right, son.
They came after me...

78
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,445
You still got it?
Well, yes, sir.

79
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,738
It's right here.

80
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,116
I'm glad to see that

81
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:04,580
because the rightful owner of this cross
won't press charges if you give it back.

82
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,834
He's got witnesses, five or six of them.

83
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,096
Yeah!

84
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:33,734
Good day.

85
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,240
You lost today, kid,

86
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,203
but it doesn't mean you have to like it.

87
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,731
Small world, Dr. Jones.

88
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,900
Too small for two of us.

89
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,577
This is the second time
I've had to reclaim

90
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,954
my property from you.

91
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,164
That belongs in a museum.

92
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,625
So do you.

93
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,211
Throw him over the side.

94
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,052
Grab him, he's getting away! Stop him!

95
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:22,361
Archeology is the search for fact...

96
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,573
...not truth.

97
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,991
If it's truth you're interested in,

98
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:31,119
Dr. Tyree's philosophy class
is right down the hall.

99
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,457
So forget any ideas you've got about
lost cities, exotic travel,

100
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,958
and digging up the world.

101
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,877
We do not follow maps
to buried treasure,

102
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:42,005
and "X" never, ever, marks the spot.

103
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:49,137
Seventy percent of all archeology
is done in the library.

104
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,014
Research. Reading.

105
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,144
We cannot afford to take mythology
at face value.

106
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,148
Next week, Egyptology,

107
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:04,069
starting with the excavation of Naukratis
by Flinders Petrie in 1885.

108
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,863
I will be in my office
if anybody's got any problems,

109
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,157
for the next hour and a half.

110
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,706
Marcus, I did it.

111
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,667
You've got it!

112
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,430
You know how long I've
been looking for that?

113
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,014
All your life.

114
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,391
All my life.

115
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,185
Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed.

116
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:41,356
This will find a place of honor
in our Spanish collection.

117
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:45,360
We can discuss my honorarium
over dinner and champagne tonight.

118
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,487
Your treat.
Yes.

119
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,031
My treat.

120
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,203
Dr. Jones!
Dr. Jones!

121
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,169
Shush! Shush!

122
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,962
Dr. Jones, I am so glad you're back.

123
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,881
Your mail is on your desk.
Here are your phone messages.

124
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:06,965
Dr. Jones, you promised...

125
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,133
This is your appointment schedule,

126
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,552
and these term papers
still haven't been graded.

127
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,971
Okay. Irene, put everybody's name
on a list,

128
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,181
get the order they arrived...

129
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,099
Oh, come on, Dr. Jones.
Dr. Jones.

130
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:20,353
...and I'll see each and
every one of them in turn.

131
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,992
"Venice, Italy."

132
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,036
Dr. Jones!

133
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,689
Dr. Jones?

134
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,988
Dr. Jones.

135
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,258
I trust your trip down
was comfortable, Dr. Jones.

136
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,511
My men didn't alarm you, I hope.

137
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,681
My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.

138
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,474
I know who you are, Mr. Donovan.

139
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,059
Your contributions to the museum
over the years

140
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,602
have been extremely generous.

141
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,896
Some of the pieces in your collection
here are very impressive.

142
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:48,984
Well, like yourself, Dr. Jones,
I have a passion for antiquities.

143
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,152
Have a look over here.

144
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,489
This might interest you.

145
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,996
Well, it's sandstone.
Christian symbol.

146
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,415
Early Latin text.

147
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,750
Mid-12th century, I should think.

148
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,669
That was our assessment, as well.

149
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,837
Where did this come from?

150
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,881
My engineers unearthed it
in the mountain region north of Ankara

151
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,175
while excavating for copper.

152
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,761
Can you translate the inscription?

153
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:23,560
"...who drinks the water
I shall give him, says the Lord,

154
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,605
"will have a spring inside him

155
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,566
"welling up for eternal life.

156
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,320
"Let them bring me
to your holy mountain

157
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,530
"in the place where you dwell.

158
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,533
"Across the desert
and through the mountain

159
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,037
"to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon,

160
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,582
"to the temple where the cup that...

161
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:53,089
"Where the cup that holds the blood
of Jesus Christ resides forever."

162
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,260
The Holy Grail, Dr. Jones.

163
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,806
The chalice used by Christ
during the Last Supper.

164
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:05,644
The cup that caught His blood
at the Crucifixion

165
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,647
and was entrusted to
Joseph of Arimathea.

166
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,483
The Arthur legend.

167
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,985
I've heard this bedtime story before.

168
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,862
Eternal life, Dr. Jones!

169
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,698
The gift of youth
to whoever drinks from the Grail.

170
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:21,159
Now, that's a bedtime story
I'd like to wake up to.

171
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,494
An old man's dream.

172
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:26,039
Every man's dream,
including your father's, I believe.

173
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,170
Grail lore is his hobby.

174
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,838
He's a teacher of medieval literature.

175
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,757
The one the students hope
they don't get.

176
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,219
Walter, you're neglecting your guests.

177
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,429
Be along in a moment, dear.

178
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,728
Hard to resist, isn't it?

179
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:52,399
The Holy Grail's final resting place
described in detail.

180
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,317
What good is it?

181
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:58,196
This Grail tablet speaks of deserts
and mountains and canyons.

182
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,698
It's pretty vague.

183
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,408
Where do you want to start looking?

184
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,827
Maybe if the tablet were intact,
you'd have something to go on,

185
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,537
but the entire top portion is missing.

186
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,957
Just the same, an attempt to recover
the Grail is currently underway.

187
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,921
Let me tell you another
bedtime story, Dr. Jones.

188
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,049
After the Grail was entrusted
to Joseph of Arimathea,

189
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,010
it disappeared,
and was lost for a thousand years

190
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:24,848
before it was found again
by three knights of the First Crusade.

191
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,391
Three brothers, to be exact.

192
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,476
I've heard this one, as well.

193
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,603
Two of these brothers
walked out of the desert

194
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:33,732
150 years after having found the Grail

195
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,859
and began the long journey
back to France,

196
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,986
but only one of them made it.

197
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,448
And before dying of extreme old age,

198
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:46,161
he supposedly imparted his tale to a...
to a Franciscan friar, I think.

199
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,997
Not "supposedly," Dr. Jones.

200
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:54,127
This is the manuscript in which
the friar chronicled the knight's story.

201
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,172
It doesn't reveal the location of
the Grail, I'm afraid,

202
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,048
but the knight promised
that two markers

203
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,675
that had been left behind would.

204
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,387
This tablet is one of those markers.

205
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,681
It proves the knight's story is true.

206
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,350
But as you pointed out, it's incomplete.

207
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,395
Now, the second marker is entombed
with the knight's dead brother.

208
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,565
Our project leader
believes that tomb to be located

209
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,318
within the city of Venice, Italy.

210
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,781
As you can now see, Dr. Jones,

211
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,867
we're about to complete a great quest

212
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,995
that began almost 2,000 years ago.

213
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,456
We're only one step away.

214
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,709
That's usually when the ground falls out
from underneath your feet.

215
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,420
You could be more right than you know.

216
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,797
Yes?

217
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:40,715
We've hit a snag.

218
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:45,762
Our project leader has vanished,
along with all his research.

219
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,349
We received a cable from his colleague,
Dr. Schneider,

220
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:53,144
who has no idea of his whereabouts
or what's become of him.

221
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,898
I want you to pick up the trail
where he left off.

222
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,068
Find the man,
and you will find the Grail.

223
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:04,405
You've got the wrong Jones,
Mr. Donovan.

224
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,201
Why don't you try my father?

225
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,078
We already have.

226
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,122
Your father is the man
who has disappeared.

227
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,011
Your father and I have been
friends since time began.

228
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,304
I've watched you grow up, Indy.

229
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:30,098
I've watched the two of you grow apart.

230
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,183
I've never seen you this concerned
about him before.

231
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,393
Dad?

232
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,603
He's an academic, a bookworm.
He's not a field man.

233
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:36,771
Dad?

234
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:38,439
Dad?

235
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,191
Dear God.

236
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:46,322
What has the old fool
got himself into now?

237
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:50,410
I don't know, but whatever it is,
he's in over his head.

238
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,161
Dad?

239
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,498
It's today's mail, and it's been opened.

240
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,168
Mail.

241
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,462
That's it, Marcus.

242
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,425
Venice, Italy.

243
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,138
What is it?

244
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,310
It's Dad's Grail diary.

245
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,315
Every clue he followed.
Every discovery he made.

246
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,901
A complete record of his search
for the Holy Grail.

247
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,571
This is his whole life.

248
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,657
Why would he have sent this to me?

249
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,159
I don't know,

250
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,870
but someone must want it pretty badly.

251
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,924
Do you believe, Marcus?

252
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,813
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?

253
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:06,778
The search for the Cup of Christ
is the search for the divine in all of us.

254
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,864
But if you want facts, Indy,
I've none to give you.

255
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:14,452
At my age, I'm prepared to
take a few things on faith.

256
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,542
Call Donovan, Marcus.

257
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,545
Tell him I'll take that ticket
to Venice now.

258
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,216
I'll tell him we'll take two.

259
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,974
All right, tell me what's going to happen
when we get to Venice.

260
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,017
Don't worry, Dr. Schneider
will be there to meet you.

261
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,519
Schneider?
I maintain an apartment in Venice.

262
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,645
It's at your disposal.

263
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,647
Oh, well, that's good. Thank you.

264
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:47,068
Dr. Jones, good luck.

265
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,905
Now be very careful.
Don't trust anybody.

266
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,025
Signora? Signorina?

267
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,452
Ah, Venice...
Yes.

268
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:41,622
How will we recognize
this Dr. Schneider when we see him?

269
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,751
I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.

270
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:46,169
Dr. Jones?

271
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:48,963
Yes?

272
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,299
I knew it was you.

273
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,135
You have your father's eyes.

274
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,432
And my mother's ears,
but the rest belongs to you.

275
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,685
Looks like the best parts
have already been spoken for.

276
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,688
Marcus Brody?
That's right.

277
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,523
Dr. Elsa Schneider.

278
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:08,775
How do you do?

279
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,653
The last time I saw your father,
we were in the library.

280
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:15,239
He was very close to tracking down
the knight's tomb.

281
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:17,200
I've never seen him
so excited.

282
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,619
He was as giddy as a schoolboy.

283
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,704
Who? Attila the Professor?

284
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,957
He was never giddy,
even when he was a schoolboy.

285
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,668
Fräulein, will you permit me?

286
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:29,754
I usually don't.
I usually don't, either.

287
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,256
In that case, I permit you.
It would make me very happy.

288
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,675
But I'm already sad.
By tomorrow, it will have faded.

289
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
Tomorrow I'll steal you another.

290
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,179
I hate to interrupt you,
but the reason we're here...

291
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,223
Yes. I have something to show you.

292
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,100
I left your father working in the library.

293
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:45,269
He sent me to the map section
to fetch an ancient plan of the city.

294
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:48,189
When I got back to his table,
he'd gone, with all his papers,

295
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,775
except for that scrap,
which I found near his chair.

296
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:51,859
Roman numerals.

297
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:54,237
Here is the library.

298
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,240
That doesn't look
much like a library.

299
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,450
Looks like a converted church.

300
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,619
In this case, it's the literal truth.

301
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,454
We are on holy ground.

302
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:07,166
These columns over here
were brought back as spoils of war

303
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:10,545
after the sacking of Byzantium
during the Crusades.

304
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,506
Now, please excuse me.

305
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,299
The library's closing in a few moments.

306
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:18,344
I'll arrange for us
to stay a little longer.

307
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:24,559
Marcus, I've seen this window before.

308
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,643
Where?

309
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,895
Right here, in Dad's diary.

310
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,655
You see?

311
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:40,533
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals.

312
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:43,286
Dad was onto something here.

313
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,204
Well, now we know
the source of the numbers,

314
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,248
but we still don't know what they mean.

315
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,833
Dad sent me this diary for a reason.

316
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,627
Until we find out why,
I suggest we keep it to ourselves.

317
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:52,920
Find something?

318
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,006
Yes. Three, seven and ten.

319
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,592
That window seems to be
the source of the Roman numerals.

320
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,260
My God, I must be blind.

321
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,513
Dad wasn't looking for a book
about the knight's tomb,

322
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,557
he was looking for the tomb itself.

323
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,975
Don't you get it?

324
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,019
The tomb is somewhere in the library.

325
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,021
You said yourself it used to be a church.

326
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,230
Look.

327
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,690
Three.

328
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,194
Three.

329
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,737
Seven.

330
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,363
Seven. Ten.

331
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,283
And ten.

332
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,160
Now where's the ten?

333
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,788
Look around for the ten.

334
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,591
Three and seven.

335
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,760
Seven and seven

336
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:42,803
and ten.

337
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,492
Ten.

338
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,329
"X" marks the spot.

339
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,054
Bingo.

340
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,723
You don't disappoint, Dr. Jones.

341
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,349
You're a great deal like your father.

342
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:11,976
Except he's lost, and I'm not.

343
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,561
Lower me down.

344
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,032
Look after this for me, will you?

345
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,088
Come on.

346
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,599
Pagan symbols. Fourth or fifth century.

347
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:52,767
Right.

348
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,311
600 years before the Crusades.

349
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,897
The Christians would have
dug their own passages

350
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,191
and burial chambers centuries later.

351
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,233
That's right.

352
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,861
If there's a knight of
the First Crusade down here,

353
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,446
that's where we'll find him.

354
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,397
What's this one?

355
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:40,940
The Ark of the Covenant.

356
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,109
Are you sure?
Pretty sure.

357
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:02,169
Watch out.

358
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:18,769
It's petroleum.

359
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:21,689
I should sink a well down here
and retire.

360
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,040
Give me the lighter.

361
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:51,886
Oh, rats.

362
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,570
Come on.

363
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,870
Come here.

364
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,923
Look, it... it must be one of these.

365
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:15,135
Look at the artistry
of these carvings, and the scrollwork.

366
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,112
It's this one.

367
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:51,255
This is it. We found it.

368
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,010
Look.

369
00:34:56,845 --> 00:35:01,015
The engraving on the shield,
it's the same as on the Grail tablet.

370
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:05,352
The shield is the second marker.

371
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,146
What's that?

372
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:10,274
It's a rubbing Dad made
of the Grail tablet.

373
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:15,279
Just like your father,
giddy as a schoolboy.

374
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,949
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if he were here now to see this?

375
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:23,203
He never would have
made it past the rats.

376
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:24,538
He hates rats.

377
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,373
He's scared to death of them.

378
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,314
Get back! Back against the wall.

379
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,154
Quick! Under it! Air pocket!

380
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,287
Don't wander off.
What?

381
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,789
What?

382
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,851
I think I've found a way out.

383
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,311
Deep breath.

384
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,580
Ah, Venice.

385
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,690
Are you crazy? Don't go between them!

386
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,193
Go between them? Are you crazy?

387
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,206
I said go around!

388
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,333
You said go between them!

389
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,044
I said, don't go between them!

390
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,440
No!

391
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,447
Why are you trying to kill us?

392
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,408
Because you're looking
for the Holy Grail.

393
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:33,120
My father was looking for the Holy Grail.
Did you kill him too?

394
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,204
No.

395
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:36,123
Where is he?

396
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,250
Talk or you're dead.

397
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,960
Damn it, tell me!

398
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:41,795
Tell me!

399
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,423
If you don't let go, Dr. Jones,
we'll both die.

400
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,008
Then we'll die.

401
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,927
My soul is prepared. How's yours?

402
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,222
This is your last chance.

403
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,558
No, Dr. Jones, it's yours.

404
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,619
All right, where's my father?

405
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:16,538
If you let me go,
I will tell you where he is.

406
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,498
Who are you?

407
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,500
My name is Kazim.

408
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,085
And why were you trying to kill me?

409
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:26,840
The secret of the Grail has been safe
for a thousand years,

410
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,926
and for all that time,

411
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,969
the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword

412
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:34,264
have been prepared
to do anything to keep it safe.

413
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,852
Let me off at this jetty.

414
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:46,360
Ask yourself, why do you
seek the Cup of Christ?

415
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:49,821
Is it for His glory, or for yours?

416
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:54,534
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ.
I came to find my father.

417
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,789
In that case,
God be with you in your quest.

418
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,041
Your father is being held
in the Castle of Brunwald,

419
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,377
on the Austrian-German border.

420
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,512
How's the head?

421
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,014
It's better, now I've seen this.

422
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,185
It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta"?

423
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,190
The knights of the First Crusade

424
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:28,568
laid siege to the city
of Alexandretta for over a year.

425
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,904
The entire city was destroyed.

426
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:37,244
The present city of Iskenderun
is built on its ruins.

427
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,581
Marcus, you remember
what the Grail tablet said,

428
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,333
"Across the desert
and through the mountain

429
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,003
"to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."

430
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,674
But where exactly?

431
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,634
Your father would know.

432
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,556
Your father did know.
Look. He made a map.

433
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:00,225
He must have pieced it together
from clues scattered through

434
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,477
the whole history of the Grail quest.

435
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:03,562
A map with no names.

436
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:07,441
Now, he knew there was a city
with an oasis due east, here.

437
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,360
He knew the course turned south
through the desert to a river,

438
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,279
and the river led
into the mountains, here.

439
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,655
Straight to the canyon.

440
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,241
He knew everything
except where to begin,

441
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:18,118
the name of the city.

442
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,371
Alexandretta.

443
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,041
Now we know.
Yes. Now we know.

444
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,710
Marcus, get hold of Sallah.
Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.

445
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,295
What about you?

446
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,421
I'm going after Dad.

447
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:52,527
Elsa?

448
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,160
Elsa? Elsa?

449
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,965
My room...
Mine, too.

450
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,343
What were they looking for?

451
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,511
This.

452
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,513
The Grail diary?
Uh-huh.

453
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:22,516
You had it?

454
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,143
You didn't trust me.

455
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:26,895
I didn't know you.

456
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,481
At least I let you tag along.

457
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:30,774
Oh, yes.

458
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,777
Give them a flower,
and they'll follow you anywhere.

459
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,614
Knock it off. You're not mad.

460
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:39,199
No?

461
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,910
No. You like the way I do things.

462
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,954
It's lucky I don't do things the same way.

463
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,832
You'd still be standing
at the Venice pier!

464
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:50,127
Look, what do you think
is going on here?

465
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,671
Since I met you,
I've nearly been incinerated,

466
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:55,215
drowned, shot at,
and chopped into fish bait.

467
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:56,800
We're caught in the middle
of something sinister here.

468
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,845
My guess is Dad found out
more than he was looking for.

469
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:03,223
And until I'm sure,
I'm going to continue to do things

470
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,892
the way I think they should be done.

471
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,897
How dare you kiss me!

472
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:20,323
Leave me alone. I don't like fast women.

473
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:24,494
And I hate arrogant men.

474
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:36,506
Ah, Venice.

475
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,498
What do you know about this place?

476
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:13,668
I know the Brunwalds
are famous art collectors.

477
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:17,756
What are you going to do?

478
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:20,300
Don't know. I'll think of something.

479
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:29,017
Yes?

480
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,894
And not before time!

481
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:33,438
Did you intend to leave us
standing on the doorstep all day?

482
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:34,856
We're drenched!

483
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:38,902
Now look, I've gone and caught a sniffle.

484
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,237
Are you expected?

485
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:43,073
Do not take that tone with me,
my good man.

486
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,991
Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald

487
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:48,662
that Lord Clarence MacDonald
and his lovely assistant

488
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,081
are here to view the tapestries.

489
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,332
Tapestries?

490
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,917
Dear me, the man is dense.

491
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:57,295
This is a castle, isn't it?
There are tapestries?

492
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,714
This is a castle,

493
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:02,342
and we have many tapestries.

494
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:06,638
But if you are a Scottish lord,
then I am Mickey Mouse!

495
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,516
How dare he?

496
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,129
Nazis. I hate these guys.

497
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,227
This one. I think he's in here.

498
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:55,979
How do you know?

499
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,814
Because it's wired.

500
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:28,094
Indy? Indy?

501
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:30,597
Don't worry. This is kid's play.

502
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,474
I'll be right back.

503
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,291
Junior?

504
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:00,668
Yes, sir.

505
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:02,712
It is you, Junior!

506
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:05,215
Don't call me that, please.

507
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,633
Well, what are you doing here?

508
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,385
I came to get you. What do you thi...

509
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,314
Late 14th century, Ming dynasty.

510
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:23,942
It breaks the heart.

511
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,361
And the head. You hit me, Dad.

512
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,488
I'll never forgive myself.

513
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,907
Don't worry, I'm fine.

514
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:34,160
Thank God.

515
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:38,623
It's fake.

516
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:43,044
See, you can tell by the cross section.

517
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:46,005
No!

518
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:48,633
Dad, get your stuff.
We've got to get out of here.

519
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:50,427
Well, I'm sorry
about your head, though,

520
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:52,804
but I thought you were one of them.

521
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:55,515
Dad, they come in through the doors.

522
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,434
Good point.

523
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,853
But better safe than sorry.

524
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,938
So I was wrong this time.

525
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:05,483
But, by God, I wasn't wrong
when I mailed you my diary.

526
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:06,693
You obviously got it.

527
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,489
I got it, and I used it.

528
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,659
We found the entrance
to the catacombs.

529
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,244
Through the library?

530
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,079
Right.

531
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:22,876
I knew it.

532
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:24,878
And the tomb of Sir Richard?

533
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:27,797
Found it.

534
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,176
He was actually there?

535
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,346
You saw him?

536
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:37,557
Well, what was left of him.

537
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,601
And his shield,

538
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:43,396
the inscription on Sir Richard's shield?

539
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:45,773
"Alexandretta."

540
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:48,735
Alexandretta! Of course!

541
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:52,906
On the pilgrim trail
from the Eastern Empire.

542
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,660
Junior, you did it.

543
00:49:58,287 --> 00:49:59,913
No, Dad. You did.

544
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,664
Forty years.

545
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,293
If only I could have been with you.

546
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,170
There were rats, Dad.

547
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,963
Rats?

548
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:10,465
Yeah, big ones.

549
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,175
What do the Nazis want with you, Dad?

550
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,761
They wanted my diary.
Yeah?

551
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:19,390
I knew I had to get that book
as far away from me as I possibly could.

552
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:23,353
Yeah.

553
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:29,567
Dr. Jones.

554
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:30,777
Yes?

555
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,782
I will take the book now.

556
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,244
What book?

557
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:41,746
You have the diary in your pocket.

558
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,541
You dolt!

559
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,335
Do you think my son
would be that stupid

560
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:50,797
that he would bring my diary
all the way back here?

561
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:53,841
You didn't, did you?

562
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,220
You didn't bring it, did you?
Well...

563
00:50:57,638 --> 00:50:59,180
You did.

564
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:01,224
Look, can we discuss this later?

565
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,351
I should have mailed it
to the Marx Brothers.

566
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:04,978
Will you take it easy?

567
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,479
Take it easy?

568
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:08,565
Why do you think I sent it home
in the first place?

569
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,233
So it wouldn't fall into their hands!

570
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:12,318
I came here to save you!

571
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:13,403
Oh, yeah?

572
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,905
And who's gonna come
to save you, Junior?

573
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,198
I told you...

574
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:26,666
...don't call me Junior!

575
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,004
Look what you did!

576
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:34,966
I can't believe what you did...

577
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:39,053
Elsa? Elsa?

578
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:41,306
That's far enough.
Put down the gun, Dr. Jones.

579
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:43,433
Put down the gun, or the Fräulein dies.

580
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:45,810
But she's one of them.
Indy, please!

581
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:47,770
She's a Nazi.
What?

582
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,105
Trust me.
Indy, no!

583
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,189
I will kill her!

584
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,984
Yeah? Go ahead!
No! Don't shoot!

585
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,194
Don't worry. He won't.

586
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:57,780
Indy, please! Do what he says!

587
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:59,782
And don't listen to her.

588
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:01,701
Enough! She dies!

589
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,244
Wait! Wait...

590
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:12,211
I'm sorry.

591
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,048
No, don't be.

592
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:31,648
But you should have
listened to your father.

593
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,669
She ransacked her own room,
and I fell for it.

594
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,215
How did you know she was a Nazi?

595
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,885
How did you know she was a Nazi?

596
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:03,012
She talks in her sleep.

597
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:15,358
I didn't trust her. Why did you?

598
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:18,236
Because he didn't take my advice.

599
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:26,744
Donovan.

600
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:30,623
Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody,
Dr. Jones?

601
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,209
I misjudged you, Walter.

602
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:36,379
I knew you would sell your mother
for an Etruscan vase,

603
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:39,924
but I didn't know you would
sell your country and your soul

604
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,968
to the slime of humanity.

605
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,471
Dr. Schneider,

606
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:48,141
there are pages torn out of this.

607
00:53:56,817 --> 00:54:00,987
This book contained a map,
a map with no names,

608
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,197
precise directions from the unknown city

609
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:05,199
to the secret
Canyon of the Crescent Moon.

610
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:06,284
So it did.

611
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,119
Where are these missing pages,
this map?

612
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,579
We must have these pages back.

613
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,913
You're wasting your breath.

614
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:12,790
He won't tell us,

615
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,709
and he doesn't have to.

616
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:18,337
It's perfectly obvious
where the pages are.

617
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,840
He's given them to Marcus Brody.

618
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:21,966
Marcus?

619
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,427
You didn't drag poor Marcus along,
did you?

620
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,928
He's not up to the challenge.

621
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:27,472
He sticks out like a sore thumb.

622
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:28,681
We'll find him.

623
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:30,433
The hell you will.

624
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,185
He's got a two-day head start on you,

625
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,686
which is more than he needs.

626
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:36,105
Brody's got friends
in every town and village

627
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,273
from here to the Sudan.

628
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:40,026
He speaks a dozen languages,
knows every local custom.

629
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,944
He'll blend in, disappear.

630
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:43,863
You'll never see him again.

631
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,532
With any luck,
he's got the Grail already.

632
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,786
Does anyone here speak English?

633
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:50,953
Or even ancient Greek?

634
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:52,205
Water? No, thank you, sir.

635
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,623
No. Fish make love in it.

636
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,959
Goodness me. Thank you so much.
No, I don't like that.

637
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:58,211
No, I really don't want...

638
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,463
No, no, thank you very much.

639
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,548
No, thank you, madam. I'm a vegetarian.

640
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:05,760
Does anyone understand
a word I'm saying here?

641
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:07,303
Mr. Brody!

642
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:08,554
Sallah. What a relief.

643
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,973
Marcus Brody, sir.

644
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:12,767
But where is Indy?
He's in Austria.

645
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,310
A slight detour.

646
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:15,436
You are on your own?

647
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:18,231
Yes, but don't panic.
Everything's under control.

648
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:20,566
Have you, have you
arranged our supplies?

649
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:22,485
Yes, of course.
But where are we going?

650
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,028
This map will show you.

651
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,072
It was drawn by...

652
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:27,990
Mr. Brody.

653
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:29,909
Welcome to Iskenderun.

654
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:31,994
The director
of the Museum of Antiquities

655
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,204
has sent a car for you.

656
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:35,581
Well, your servant, sir.

657
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:36,916
And I am his.

658
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:38,960
Follow me, please.

659
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,003
My reputation precedes me.

660
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:43,256
There is no museum in Iskenderun.

661
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,715
Papers, please.

662
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,176
Papers? Of course.

663
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:48,719
Run.
Yes.

664
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:50,555
Papers. Got it here.

665
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:52,265
Just finished reading it myself.

666
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,517
Run.
Yes.

667
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,519
Egyptian Mail, morning edition. Run.

668
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:57,812
Did you say...

669
00:55:57,938 --> 00:55:59,355
Run!

670
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,038
Okay, okay, quick, quick, quick!

671
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:19,125
Find the back door! Find the back door!

672
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,348
Intolerable.

673
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,561
Dr. Schneider. Message from Berlin.

674
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,438
You must return immediately.

675
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:43,357
A rally at the Institute
of Aryan Culture. So?

676
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:47,612
Your presence on the platform
is requested at the highest level.

677
00:56:47,696 --> 00:56:50,698
Thank you, Herr Oberst.
I will meet you at Iskenderun.

678
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:52,700
Take this diary
to the Reichmuseum in Berlin.

679
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:55,328
It will show them our progress,
ahead of schedule.

680
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,830
Without the map,
I'm afraid it's no better than a souvenir.

681
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:59,165
Let me kill them now.

682
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,333
No.

683
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,251
If we fail to recover
the pages from Brody,

684
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:03,920
we'll need them alive.

685
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:06,505
Always do what the doctor orders.

686
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:15,848
Don't look at me like that.

687
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:18,517
We both wanted the Grail.

688
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:20,519
I would have done anything to get it.

689
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:22,605
You would have done the same.

690
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,607
I'm sorry you think so.

691
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:39,413
I can't forget how wonderful it was.

692
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:40,539
Thank you.

693
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:42,541
It was rather wonderful.

694
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,552
Dr. Schneider.

695
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,681
Your car is waiting.

696
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:06,899
That's how Austrians say good-bye.

697
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:17,326
And this is how we say good-bye
in Germany, Dr. Jones.

698
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:27,503
I liked the Austrian way better.

699
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:29,255
So did I.

700
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:30,923
Let's try and get these ropes loose.

701
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:33,843
We've got to get to Marcus
before the Nazis do.

702
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:37,638
You said he had two days' start.
That he would blend in. Disappear.

703
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:39,181
Are you kidding? I made that up.

704
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:42,476
You know Marcus.
He got lost once in his own museum.

705
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:47,523
Can you try and reach
my left jacket pocket?

706
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:49,984
What am I looking for?

707
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:51,527
My lucky charm.

708
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:54,613
Feels like a cigarette lighter.

709
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:57,324
Try and burn through the ropes.

710
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,453
Very good.

711
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:26,395
I ought to tell you something.

712
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,565
Don't get sentimental now, Dad.
Save it till we get out of here.

713
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:30,983
The floor's on fire.

714
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:32,651
See?
What?

715
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:34,612
And the chair.

716
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,073
Move! Move it out of here! Go!

717
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:38,949
It's scorching the table! Fast!

718
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:40,076
Move!
Okay!

719
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:56,842
Well, we have Marcus Brody,

720
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:59,178
but more important, we have the map.

721
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:05,101
"By the personal command
of the Führer.

722
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:07,186
"Secrecy essential to success.

723
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,688
"Eliminate the American conspirators."

724
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:13,859
Germany has declared war
on the Jones boys.

725
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:20,616
Dad!
What?

726
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:21,700
Dad!
What?

727
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:23,119
Dad!
What?

728
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:24,829
Head for the fireplace!

729
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,718
I think I can get these ropes off.

730
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:43,139
Whoops!

731
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,234
Our situation has not improved.

732
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,570
Listen, Dad, I'm almost free.

733
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:15,337
Alarm!

734
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,598
This is intolerable.

735
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:27,349
I'm out, Dad.

736
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:29,185
Well done, boy.

737
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:07,097
Come on, Dad.

738
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:15,147
Dead end.

739
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:16,482
There's got to be a...

740
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,193
A secret door or a...

741
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:20,444
Passageway or something.

742
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:23,822
I find that if I just sit down and think...

743
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,994
Dad!

744
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:34,625
...the solution presents itself.

745
01:02:42,384 --> 01:02:45,010
Great. More boats.

746
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:51,642
You say this has been
just another typical day for you, huh?

747
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:56,230
No! But better than most.

748
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,776
Come on, Dad. Come on.

749
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,569
What about the boat?

750
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:03,904
We're not going on the boat?

751
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:20,087
Jones!

752
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:33,827
Halt! Halt!

753
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:37,850
Stop!
What?

754
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:40,018
Stop! Stop!

755
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:44,356
You're going the wrong way.
We have to get to Berlin.

756
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:45,899
Brody's this way.

757
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:47,776
My diary's in Berlin.

758
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:49,820
We don't need the diary, Dad.

759
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:51,321
Marcus has the map.

760
01:05:51,406 --> 01:05:54,616
There is more in the diary
than just the map.

761
01:05:54,826 --> 01:05:57,619
All right, Dad. Tell me.

762
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:03,917
Well, he who finds the Grail
must face the final challenge.

763
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:05,794
What final challenge?

764
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:08,672
Three devices of such lethal cunning.

765
01:06:08,756 --> 01:06:10,382
Booby traps?
Oh, yes.

766
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:15,304
But I found the clues that
will safely take us through,

767
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,598
in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.

768
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:19,308
Well, what are they?

769
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:24,229
Can't you remember?

770
01:06:26,191 --> 01:06:30,110
I wrote them down in my diary
so that I wouldn't have to remember.

771
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:33,739
Half the German army's on our tail,
and you want me to go to Berlin?

772
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,824
Into the lion's den?
Yes.

773
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:38,076
The only thing that matters is the Grail.

774
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:39,620
What about Marcus?

775
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:41,288
Marcus would agree with me.

776
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:44,124
Two selfless martyrs.

777
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:45,542
Jesus Christ.

778
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:51,882
That's for blasphemy.

779
01:06:54,636 --> 01:06:58,263
The quest for the Grail
is not archeology.

780
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:01,934
It's a race against evil.

781
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:04,811
If it is captured by the Nazis,

782
01:07:04,896 --> 01:07:08,524
the armies of darkness
will march all over the face of the Earth.

783
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:09,691
Do you understand me?

784
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,695
This is an obsession, Dad.

785
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:17,032
I never understood it. Never.

786
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:21,203
Neither did Mom.

787
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:22,955
Oh, yes, she did.

788
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,957
Only too well.

789
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:29,795
Unfortunately, she kept
her illness from me

790
01:07:31,256 --> 01:07:32,798
until all I could do was mourn her.

791
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:38,864
My boy, we are pilgrims
in an unholy land.

792
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:10,562
Fräulein Doctor.

793
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:12,981
Where is it?
How did you get here?

794
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:15,108
Where is it? I want it.

795
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:20,906
You came back for the book? Why?

796
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:23,492
My father didn't want it incinerated.

797
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:25,202
Is that what you think of me?

798
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:27,663
I believe in the Grail, not the swastika.

799
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:29,081
But you stood up to be counted

800
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,500
with the enemy of everything
that the Grail stands for.

801
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,126
Who gives a damn what you think?

802
01:09:33,211 --> 01:09:35,253
You do.

803
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:38,423
All I have to do is squeeze.

804
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:41,259
All I have to do is scream.

805
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:53,855
I've got it.
Let's get the hell out of here.

806
01:11:06,554 --> 01:11:07,679
What did you get?
I don't know.

807
01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:09,181
First available flight out of Germany.

808
01:11:09,307 --> 01:11:11,016
Good.

809
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:39,377
Well, we made it.

810
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:43,381
When we're airborne,
with Germany behind us,

811
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:45,801
then I'll share that sentiment.

812
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:47,511
Relax.

813
01:12:33,391 --> 01:12:35,350
Tickets, please.

814
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:49,948
Guten Tag, Herr Jones.

815
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,871
Tickets, please.

816
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:09,009
We should get out of here.

817
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:12,637
No ticket.

818
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:16,558
Ticket.

819
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:17,726
Ticket!
Ticket!

820
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:18,935
Ticket!
Ticket!

821
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:37,913
You know,

822
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:42,083
sharing your adventures is
an interesting experience.

823
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:45,003
That's not all we shared.

824
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:47,422
It's disgraceful.
You're old enough to be her fa...

825
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:48,924
Her grandfather.

826
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:51,009
Well, I'm as human as the next man.

827
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:53,011
I was the next man.

828
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:57,557
Of course. Well...

829
01:13:57,642 --> 01:13:59,351
Ships that pass in the night.

830
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:03,521
Do you remember the last time
we had a quiet drink?

831
01:14:05,316 --> 01:14:07,317
I had a milkshake.

832
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:10,153
What did we talk about?

833
01:14:11,238 --> 01:14:13,031
We didn't talk.

834
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:16,034
We never talked.

835
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:20,121
Do I detect a rebuke?

836
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:24,459
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad.

837
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:27,087
It was a lonely way to grow up.
For you, too.

838
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:28,797
If you'd been an ordinary,
average father,

839
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:30,882
like the other guys' dads,
you'd have understood that.

840
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:34,177
Actually, I was a wonderful father.

841
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:35,804
When?

842
01:14:36,514 --> 01:14:38,932
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed?

843
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:40,475
Wash your ears? Do your homework?

844
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:45,522
No. I respected your privacy,
and I taught you self-reliance.

845
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:48,191
What you taught me was
that I was less important to you

846
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:51,653
than people who'd been dead
for 500 years in another country.

847
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:53,697
And I learned it so well

848
01:14:53,781 --> 01:14:55,991
that we've hardly spoken for 20 years.

849
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:58,910
You left just when
you were becoming interesting.

850
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:00,078
Unbelievable.

851
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:01,955
Dad, how can you...
Very well.

852
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:03,999
I'm here now.

853
01:15:05,376 --> 01:15:07,002
What do you want to talk about?

854
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:10,171
Well, I...

855
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:20,015
I can't think of anything.

856
01:15:20,391 --> 01:15:22,350
Then what are you complaining about?

857
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:25,895
Look, we have work to do.

858
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:32,569
When we get to Alexandretta,
we will face three challenges.

859
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:38,033
The first, "The Breath of God.
Only the penitent man will pass."

860
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:41,244
Second, "The Word of God.

861
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:44,372
"Only in the footsteps of God
will he proceed."

862
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:46,791
Third, "The Path of God.

863
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:52,630
"Only in the leap from the lion's head
will he prove his worth."

864
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:56,217
What does that mean?

865
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:59,220
I don't know. We'll find out.

866
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:09,022
We're turning around.

867
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:11,024
They're taking us back to Germany.

868
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:19,574
Well, I thought it would
take them a lot longer

869
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:20,909
to figure out the radio was dead.

870
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:22,660
Come on, Dad. Move!

871
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:29,459
Come on, Dad. Come on!

872
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:45,183
I didn't know you could fly a plane.

873
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:46,351
Fly, yes.

874
01:16:48,562 --> 01:16:50,522
Land, no.

875
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:16,673
Dad, you're going to have to
use the machine gun.

876
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:18,508
Get it ready.

877
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:21,261
Eleven o'clock!

878
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:23,596
Dad, eleven o'clock!

879
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:27,559
What happens at eleven o'clock?

880
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:29,310
Twelve, eleven, ten.

881
01:17:29,395 --> 01:17:32,063
Eleven o'clock, fire!

882
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:00,383
Dad, are we hit?

883
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:02,093
More or less.

884
01:18:02,636 --> 01:18:04,512
Son, I'm sorry.

885
01:18:04,597 --> 01:18:06,055
They got us.

886
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,268
Hang on, Dad. We're going in!

887
01:18:23,324 --> 01:18:25,783
Nice landing.
Thanks.

888
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:42,342
Those people are trying to kill us!

889
01:18:42,426 --> 01:18:44,177
I know, Dad!

890
01:18:44,261 --> 01:18:47,472
Well. It's a new experience for me.

891
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:49,432
It happens to me all the time.

892
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:21,881
This is intolerable!

893
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:24,634
This could be close.

894
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:35,520
Faster, boy! Faster!

895
01:19:51,245 --> 01:19:53,538
Well, they don't come
any closer than that!

896
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:12,640
Dad, he's coming back!

897
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:01,856
I suddenly
remembered my Charlemagne.

898
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:04,776
"Let my armies be
the rocks and the trees

899
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:07,111
"and the birds in the sky."

900
01:21:24,922 --> 01:21:28,341
These pages are taken from
Professor Jones' diary, Your Highness,

901
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:29,717
and they include a map

902
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:32,804
that pinpoints
the exact location of the Grail.

903
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:35,640
As you can see,
the Grail is all but in our hands.

904
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:36,933
However, Your Highness,

905
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:39,936
we would not think of crossing your soil
without your permission,

906
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:42,021
nor of removing the Grail
from your borders

907
01:21:42,106 --> 01:21:45,149
without suitable compensation.

908
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:49,946
What have you brought?

909
01:21:57,579 --> 01:22:00,123
Precious valuables, Your Highness,

910
01:22:00,207 --> 01:22:04,419
donated by some of the finest families
in all of Germany.

911
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:12,385
Rolls-Royce Phantom Two.

912
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:16,597
Four-point-three liter, 30 horsepower,
six-cylinder engine,

913
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:19,475
with Stromberg downdraft carburetor.

914
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:22,854
Can go from zero to
100 kilometers an hour

915
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:25,773
in 12.5 seconds.

916
01:22:25,858 --> 01:22:27,400
And I even like the color.

917
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,903
The keys are in the ignition,
Your Highness.

918
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:35,116
You shall have camels, horses,

919
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,618
an armed escort, provisions,

920
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:40,371
desert vehicles and tanks.

921
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:42,206
You're welcome.

922
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,098
We have no time to lose.

923
01:22:59,183 --> 01:23:01,726
Indiana Jones
and his father have escaped.

924
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:06,314
We go this way.

925
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:07,982
Get that camel out of the way.

926
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:12,695
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?

927
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:15,281
They set out across the desert
this afternoon.

928
01:23:15,365 --> 01:23:18,618
I believe they took Mr. Brody with them.

929
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:22,121
Now they have the map.

930
01:23:23,582 --> 01:23:25,208
And in this sort of race,

931
01:23:25,292 --> 01:23:28,169
there's no silver medal
for finishing second.

932
01:23:50,609 --> 01:23:53,069
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?

933
01:23:53,153 --> 01:23:55,029
I'd rather spit in your face.

934
01:23:55,113 --> 01:23:57,615
But as I haven't got any spit...

935
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:02,870
Must be within three or four miles.

936
01:24:02,955 --> 01:24:05,540
Otherwise we are off the map.

937
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:10,670
Well, Marcus,
we are on the brink of the recovery of

938
01:24:10,754 --> 01:24:14,382
the greatest artifact
in the history of mankind.

939
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:18,261
You're meddling with powers
you cannot possibly comprehend.

940
01:24:25,227 --> 01:24:27,270
I see Brody.

941
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:29,063
He seems okay.

942
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:34,777
They've got a tank.

943
01:24:40,242 --> 01:24:42,076
Six-pound gun.

944
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,036
What do you think you're doing there?
Get down!

945
01:24:44,955 --> 01:24:46,998
Dad, we're well out of range.

946
01:24:57,301 --> 01:24:58,467
That car belonged to my brother-in-law.

947
01:24:58,552 --> 01:25:00,094
Come on, come on!

948
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:02,430
I can't see anyone up there.

949
01:25:02,514 --> 01:25:03,764
Maybe it wasn't even Jones.

950
01:25:03,849 --> 01:25:06,100
No, it is him, all right.

951
01:25:06,184 --> 01:25:07,810
He's here somewhere.

952
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:10,813
Put Brody in the tank.

953
01:25:17,738 --> 01:25:20,531
Well, in this sun,

954
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:22,950
without transportation,
they're as good as dead.

955
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:33,878
It's Jones, all right.

956
01:25:38,383 --> 01:25:40,468
Now, who are all these people?
Who cares?

957
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:42,386
As long as
they're keeping Donovan busy.

958
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:46,807
Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I
organize some transportation.

959
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:13,918
I'm going after those horses.
I'll take the camels.

960
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:15,586
I don't need camels.
But, Indy...

961
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:17,088
No camels.

962
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:29,475
Who is he?

963
01:26:31,061 --> 01:26:33,187
A messenger from God.

964
01:26:34,648 --> 01:26:36,982
For the unrighteous,

965
01:26:37,067 --> 01:26:40,653
the Cup of Life
holds everlasting damnation.

966
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:01,882
Marcus!

967
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:05,636
"Genius of the Restoration..."

968
01:27:06,096 --> 01:27:08,472
"Aid our own resuscitation."

969
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:09,765
Henry, what are you doing here?

970
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:11,225
It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.

971
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:19,233
Search him.

972
01:27:20,152 --> 01:27:21,986
What is in this book?

973
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:25,489
That miserable little diary of yours.

974
01:27:25,949 --> 01:27:27,992
We have the map. The book is useless.

975
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:30,953
And yet you come all the way back
to Berlin to get it.

976
01:27:31,037 --> 01:27:32,663
Why?

977
01:27:32,748 --> 01:27:34,790
What are you hiding?

978
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:38,377
What does the diary tell you
that it doesn't tell us?

979
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:43,591
It tells me that goose-stepping morons
like yourself

980
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:46,761
should try reading books
instead of burning them.

981
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:48,345
Colonel!

982
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:50,431
Jones is getting away.

983
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:51,599
I think not,

984
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:53,017
Herr Donovan.

985
01:27:53,226 --> 01:27:56,061
Not that Jones, the other Jones!

986
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:07,448
Sallah, I said no camels!

987
01:28:07,532 --> 01:28:09,784
That's five camels. Can't you count?

988
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:12,203
Compensation for
my brother-in-law's car.

989
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:14,330
Indy, your father and Brody...

990
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:15,790
Where's my father?

991
01:28:15,874 --> 01:28:17,041
They have them.

992
01:28:17,334 --> 01:28:19,376
In the belly of that steel beast.

993
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:43,609
Fire!

994
01:30:44,564 --> 01:30:46,857
Dad! Dad!

995
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:49,193
Dad!
Junior?

996
01:30:49,277 --> 01:30:50,611
Junior?

997
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:52,029
Junior!

998
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:09,231
Dad!

999
01:32:09,983 --> 01:32:11,066
Dad!

1000
01:32:11,192 --> 01:32:12,943
Dad! Get out!

1001
01:33:33,399 --> 01:33:34,691
Henry, the pen...

1002
01:33:34,943 --> 01:33:36,360
What?
But don't you see?

1003
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:39,696
The pen is mightier than the sword.

1004
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:03,637
Look what you did.

1005
01:34:03,721 --> 01:34:05,222
It's war.

1006
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:13,564
Didn't I tell you it was a rescue?

1007
01:35:17,587 --> 01:35:19,671
Dad!
Yeah?

1008
01:35:20,632 --> 01:35:22,132
You call this archeology?

1009
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:23,383
Get out of there, Dad.

1010
01:35:34,687 --> 01:35:36,396
How does one get off this thing?

1011
01:35:43,321 --> 01:35:44,446
Where's Marcus?

1012
01:35:49,118 --> 01:35:50,702
Dad!

1013
01:35:54,123 --> 01:35:55,290
Hang on, Dad!

1014
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:04,216
Father of Indy, give me your hand!

1015
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:06,093
Sallah!

1016
01:36:06,177 --> 01:36:07,469
Get Dad!

1017
01:36:07,553 --> 01:36:09,346
Give me your hand!

1018
01:36:58,104 --> 01:36:59,896
Junior!

1019
01:37:01,774 --> 01:37:03,859
Indy!

1020
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:14,536
Oh, God.

1021
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:16,747
I've lost him.

1022
01:37:20,335 --> 01:37:22,961
And I never told him anything.

1023
01:37:25,465 --> 01:37:28,008
I just wasn't ready, Marcus.

1024
01:37:29,010 --> 01:37:31,678
Five minutes would have been enough.

1025
01:38:08,633 --> 01:38:11,301
I thought I'd lost you, boy!

1026
01:38:12,804 --> 01:38:14,971
I thought you had too, sir.

1027
01:38:27,985 --> 01:38:29,528
Well...

1028
01:38:31,781 --> 01:38:34,825
Well done. Come on.

1029
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:39,663
Let's go, then.

1030
01:38:42,166 --> 01:38:45,127
Why are you sitting there resting
when we're so near the end?

1031
01:38:45,211 --> 01:38:47,170
Come on, let's go!

1032
01:38:59,684 --> 01:39:03,437
The Canyon of the Crescent Moon.

1033
01:41:31,002 --> 01:41:32,294
Helmut, another volunteer!

1034
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:04,159
I never expected to see you again.

1035
01:42:04,243 --> 01:42:06,661
I'm like a bad penny, I always turn up.

1036
01:42:06,746 --> 01:42:10,415
Step back now, Dr. Schneider.
Give Dr. Jones some room.

1037
01:42:11,167 --> 01:42:13,460
He's going to recover the Grail for us.

1038
01:42:16,547 --> 01:42:20,759
Impossible? What do you say, Jones?
Ready to go down in history?

1039
01:42:20,843 --> 01:42:23,928
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?

1040
01:42:24,013 --> 01:42:25,555
The Nazis?

1041
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:28,058
Is that the limit of your vision?

1042
01:42:28,434 --> 01:42:32,103
The Nazis want to write themselves
into the Grail legend,

1043
01:42:32,188 --> 01:42:33,605
take on the world.

1044
01:42:34,315 --> 01:42:36,232
Well, they're welcome.

1045
01:42:37,401 --> 01:42:39,486
But I want the Grail itself.

1046
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:42,697
The cup that gives everlasting life.

1047
01:42:43,699 --> 01:42:46,284
Hitler can have the world,
but he can't take it with him.

1048
01:42:47,328 --> 01:42:51,247
I'm going to be drinking my own health
when he's gone the way of the dodo.

1049
01:42:55,211 --> 01:42:57,462
The Grail is mine,

1050
01:42:57,546 --> 01:42:59,506
and you're going to get it for me.

1051
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:01,591
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.

1052
01:43:02,051 --> 01:43:03,802
You know something, Dr. Jones?

1053
01:43:03,886 --> 01:43:05,804
You're absolutely right.

1054
01:43:08,474 --> 01:43:09,516
Dad?

1055
01:43:10,768 --> 01:43:11,935
Dad?

1056
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:13,687
Junior...

1057
01:43:13,771 --> 01:43:15,563
No!
Get back!

1058
01:43:33,582 --> 01:43:35,625
You can't save him when you're dead!

1059
01:43:36,001 --> 01:43:37,252
The healing power of the Grail

1060
01:43:37,336 --> 01:43:39,379
is the only thing
that can save your father now.

1061
01:43:39,463 --> 01:43:42,924
It's time to ask yourself
what you believe.

1062
01:44:18,461 --> 01:44:20,462
"The Breath of God.

1063
01:44:21,672 --> 01:44:24,340
"Only the penitent man will pass."

1064
01:44:25,634 --> 01:44:28,178
"The penitent man will pass."

1065
01:44:46,238 --> 01:44:49,532
The penitent man will pass.

1066
01:44:49,617 --> 01:44:51,659
The penitent man...

1067
01:44:54,079 --> 01:44:56,831
"Only the penitent man will pass."

1068
01:44:56,916 --> 01:44:59,250
"Only the penitent man will pass."

1069
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:03,421
The penitent man will pass.
The penitent, penitent...

1070
01:45:03,506 --> 01:45:04,798
The penitent man...

1071
01:45:04,965 --> 01:45:07,509
The penitent man... The penitent...

1072
01:45:07,885 --> 01:45:10,637
The penitent man is humble before God.

1073
01:45:10,721 --> 01:45:12,472
Penitent. Penitent...

1074
01:45:12,556 --> 01:45:14,307
The penitent man...

1075
01:45:14,558 --> 01:45:17,185
Penitent man is humble,

1076
01:45:17,645 --> 01:45:19,354
kneels before God.

1077
01:45:19,438 --> 01:45:21,314
Kneel!

1078
01:45:29,198 --> 01:45:30,490
I'm through!

1079
01:45:32,743 --> 01:45:34,118
We're through.

1080
01:45:36,247 --> 01:45:37,831
He's all right.

1081
01:45:37,915 --> 01:45:39,249
No.

1082
01:45:39,875 --> 01:45:42,627
The second challenge:
"The Word of God."

1083
01:45:42,711 --> 01:45:46,464
"Only in the footsteps of God
will he proceed."

1084
01:45:50,135 --> 01:45:52,512
The Word of God...

1085
01:45:52,596 --> 01:45:53,888
The Word of...

1086
01:45:56,976 --> 01:46:00,562
Proceed in the footsteps of the Word.

1087
01:46:00,771 --> 01:46:03,940
"The Word of God..."
No, Henry. Try not to talk.

1088
01:46:11,156 --> 01:46:12,907
The name of God...

1089
01:46:14,618 --> 01:46:17,120
The name of God...

1090
01:46:18,789 --> 01:46:20,999
Jehovah.

1091
01:46:21,542 --> 01:46:26,838
But in the Latin alphabet,
Jehovah begins with an "I."

1092
01:46:27,548 --> 01:46:28,715
J...

1093
01:46:34,889 --> 01:46:36,097
Oh, dear.

1094
01:46:40,311 --> 01:46:42,228
Idiot!

1095
01:46:42,313 --> 01:46:44,689
In Latin, Jehovah starts with an "I."

1096
01:46:47,484 --> 01:46:48,985
"I."

1097
01:46:49,695 --> 01:46:50,737
"E."

1098
01:46:52,406 --> 01:46:53,448
"H."

1099
01:46:54,033 --> 01:46:55,533
"O."

1100
01:46:56,702 --> 01:46:58,202
"V."

1101
01:46:58,287 --> 01:46:59,746
"A."

1102
01:47:22,227 --> 01:47:23,853
"The Path of God."

1103
01:47:27,650 --> 01:47:29,609
"Only in the leap from the lion's head

1104
01:47:30,527 --> 01:47:32,862
"will he prove his worth."

1105
01:47:36,617 --> 01:47:39,702
Impossible, nobody can jump this.

1106
01:47:42,581 --> 01:47:43,581
Indy!

1107
01:47:44,208 --> 01:47:45,667
Indy, you must hurry!

1108
01:47:45,876 --> 01:47:47,543
Come quickly!

1109
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:56,010
It's a leap of faith.

1110
01:47:56,095 --> 01:47:57,387
Oh, geez...

1111
01:47:57,721 --> 01:47:59,973
You must believe, boy.

1112
01:48:00,057 --> 01:48:02,475
You must believe.

1113
01:49:49,249 --> 01:49:51,751
I knew you'd come,

1114
01:49:51,835 --> 01:49:54,087
but my strength has left me.

1115
01:49:54,838 --> 01:49:56,005
Who are you?

1116
01:49:56,507 --> 01:49:58,633
The last of three brothers

1117
01:49:58,717 --> 01:50:01,803
who swore an oath to find the Grail

1118
01:50:01,887 --> 01:50:03,763
and to guard it.

1119
01:50:04,723 --> 01:50:06,349
That was 700 years ago.

1120
01:50:06,683 --> 01:50:09,018
A long time to wait.

1121
01:50:11,146 --> 01:50:14,649
You're strangely dressed, for a knight.

1122
01:50:15,484 --> 01:50:17,276
I'm not exactly...

1123
01:50:18,153 --> 01:50:19,779
A knight? What do you mean?

1124
01:50:20,364 --> 01:50:22,073
I was chosen

1125
01:50:22,157 --> 01:50:25,701
because I was the bravest,
the most worthy.

1126
01:50:25,786 --> 01:50:29,122
The honor was mine until another came

1127
01:50:29,206 --> 01:50:32,375
to challenge me to single combat.

1128
01:50:33,544 --> 01:50:39,507
I pass it to you who vanquished me.

1129
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:45,388
Listen, I don't have
time to explain, but...

1130
01:51:02,406 --> 01:51:03,823
Which one is it?

1131
01:51:04,241 --> 01:51:06,492
You must choose,

1132
01:51:06,577 --> 01:51:08,703
but choose wisely.

1133
01:51:08,787 --> 01:51:12,165
For as the true Grail will bring you life,

1134
01:51:12,249 --> 01:51:13,291
the false Grail

1135
01:51:13,709 --> 01:51:15,585
will take it from you.

1136
01:51:21,592 --> 01:51:23,342
I'm not a historian.

1137
01:51:23,427 --> 01:51:25,469
I have no idea what it looks like.

1138
01:51:25,554 --> 01:51:27,930
Which one is it?

1139
01:51:28,015 --> 01:51:29,640
Let me choose.

1140
01:51:30,601 --> 01:51:32,560
Thank you, Doctor.

1141
01:51:45,490 --> 01:51:47,450
Oh, yes.

1142
01:51:52,998 --> 01:51:56,459
It's more beautiful
than I'd ever imagined.

1143
01:52:07,804 --> 01:52:11,140
This certainly is the cup of
the King of Kings.

1144
01:52:17,606 --> 01:52:19,607
Eternal life.

1145
01:52:54,559 --> 01:52:56,978
What is happening to me?

1146
01:53:01,525 --> 01:53:03,401
Tell me, what is happening?

1147
01:53:26,717 --> 01:53:28,884
He chose

1148
01:53:28,969 --> 01:53:30,720
poorly.

1149
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:43,024
It would not be made out of gold.

1150
01:53:43,108 --> 01:53:45,276
That's the cup of a carpenter.

1151
01:53:55,412 --> 01:53:57,330
There's only one way to find out.

1152
01:54:11,928 --> 01:54:15,681
You have chosen wisely.

1153
01:54:16,767 --> 01:54:21,062
But the Grail cannot pass
beyond the Great Seal.

1154
01:54:21,146 --> 01:54:26,275
That is the boundary
and the price of immortality.

1155
01:55:52,779 --> 01:55:55,573
Drop your guns. Please.

1156
01:55:58,910 --> 01:56:00,703
Dad, come on, get to your feet.

1157
01:56:15,302 --> 01:56:17,261
We have got it. Come on!

1158
01:56:18,722 --> 01:56:21,140
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!

1159
01:56:21,641 --> 01:56:23,267
It's ours, Indy, yours and mine.

1160
01:56:23,810 --> 01:56:25,853
Elsa, don't cross the Seal.

1161
01:56:25,937 --> 01:56:28,898
The knight warned us
not to take the Grail from here.

1162
01:56:55,509 --> 01:56:56,550
Junior!

1163
01:56:56,635 --> 01:56:58,427
Junior!

1164
01:57:00,847 --> 01:57:02,056
Elsa...

1165
01:57:03,266 --> 01:57:05,142
Elsa, don't. Elsa...

1166
01:57:05,519 --> 01:57:06,936
Elsa...

1167
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:09,355
Give me your other hand, honey.
I can't hold you!

1168
01:57:09,439 --> 01:57:11,690
I can reach it. I can reach it.

1169
01:57:11,775 --> 01:57:14,401
Elsa, give me your hand.
Give me your other hand!

1170
01:57:17,113 --> 01:57:18,364
Elsa!

1171
01:57:28,667 --> 01:57:30,292
Junior, give me your other hand!

1172
01:57:30,377 --> 01:57:32,294
I can't hold on.

1173
01:57:32,379 --> 01:57:33,587
I can get it.

1174
01:57:33,672 --> 01:57:35,965
I can almost reach it, Dad.

1175
01:57:36,508 --> 01:57:38,217
Indiana...

1176
01:57:39,427 --> 01:57:40,636
Indiana...

1177
01:57:44,015 --> 01:57:46,225
Let it go.

1178
01:58:05,495 --> 01:58:07,079
Dad...

1179
01:58:13,670 --> 01:58:15,504
Please, Dad.

1180
01:58:46,995 --> 01:58:49,830
Elsa never really believed in the Grail.

1181
01:58:49,914 --> 01:58:52,791
She thought she'd found a prize.

1182
01:58:59,049 --> 01:59:01,175
What did you find, Dad?

1183
01:59:01,384 --> 01:59:02,885
Me?

1184
01:59:05,513 --> 01:59:07,681
Illumination.

1185
01:59:16,858 --> 01:59:18,067
And what did you find, Junior?

1186
01:59:18,610 --> 01:59:20,611
"Junior"? Dad...

1187
01:59:20,695 --> 01:59:23,197
Please, what does it always mean,
this... This "Junior"?

1188
01:59:23,281 --> 01:59:26,158
That's his name: Henry Jones, Junior.

1189
01:59:26,242 --> 01:59:28,077
I like Indiana.

1190
01:59:28,161 --> 01:59:30,162
We named the dog Indiana.

1191
01:59:30,246 --> 01:59:32,414
May we go home now, please?

1192
01:59:32,499 --> 01:59:33,666
The dog?

1193
01:59:34,542 --> 01:59:36,835
You are named after the dog?

1194
01:59:39,297 --> 01:59:42,925
I've got a lot of fond memories
of that dog.

1195
01:59:44,302 --> 01:59:46,845
Ready?
Ready.

1196
01:59:46,930 --> 01:59:50,140
Indy! Henry! Follow me. I know the way!

1197
01:59:55,939 --> 01:59:57,815
Got lost in his own museum, huh?

1198
01:59:57,899 --> 01:59:59,108
Uh-huh.

1199
01:59:59,734 --> 02:00:02,194
After you, Junior.

1200
02:00:02,278 --> 02:00:04,029
Yes, sir.
