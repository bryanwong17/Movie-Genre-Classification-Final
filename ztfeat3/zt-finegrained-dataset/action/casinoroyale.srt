2
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:17,697
M doesn't mind you earning
a little money on the side, Dryden.

3
00:01:18,236 --> 00:01:21,569
She'd just prefer it
if it wasn't selling secrets.

4
00:01:30,648 --> 00:01:32,775
If the theatrics
are supposed to scare me...

5
00:01:32,984 --> 00:01:35,475
...you have the wrong man, Bond.

6
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:39,046
If M was so sure that I was bent...

7
00:01:39,257 --> 00:01:41,191
...she'd have sent a double-0.

8
00:01:42,193 --> 00:01:44,593
Benefits of being section chief...

9
00:01:44,796 --> 00:01:47,458
...I'd know if anyone had been
promoted to double-0 status...

10
00:01:47,665 --> 00:01:48,962
...wouldn't I?

11
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:54,562
- Your file shows no kills, and it takes...
- Two.

12
00:02:09,454 --> 00:02:11,217
Shame.

13
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,887
We barely got to know each other.

14
00:02:17,562 --> 00:02:19,120
I know where you keep your gun.

15
00:02:21,132 --> 00:02:23,157
I suppose that's something.

16
00:02:24,502 --> 00:02:26,527
True.

17
00:02:27,405 --> 00:02:28,770
How did he die?

18
00:02:28,973 --> 00:02:30,440
Your contact?

19
00:02:31,142 --> 00:02:32,131
Not well.

20
00:03:14,853 --> 00:03:16,514
Made you feel it, did he?

21
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,754
Well...

22
00:03:22,093 --> 00:03:24,186
...you needn't worry.

23
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:26,321
The second is...

24
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:32,132
Yes.

25
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,995
Considerably.

26
00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:32,407
So how do I trust this man
that I've never met with my money?

27
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:35,178
You asked for the introduction.

28
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:37,609
That's all my organization
will guarantee.

29
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,685
I suppose our friend
Mr. White will have told you...

30
00:08:20,892 --> 00:08:23,156
...that I have provided
reliable banking services...

31
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:26,057
...for many other
freedom fighters over the years.

32
00:08:30,835 --> 00:08:33,133
Do you believe in God,
Mr. Le Chiffre?

33
00:08:33,337 --> 00:08:34,964
No.

34
00:08:35,173 --> 00:08:37,835
I believe in
a reasonable rate of return.

35
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:40,306
I want no risk in the portfolio.

36
00:08:40,511 --> 00:08:41,773
Agreed.

37
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,776
And I can access it
anywhere in the world?

38
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:45,173
Yes.

39
00:09:03,734 --> 00:09:06,362
I have the money,
so short another million shares...

40
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:08,232
<i>... of Skyfleet stock.</i>

41
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:12,307
Sir, you must know you're betting
against the market.

42
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,673
No one expects this stock
to go anywhere but up.

43
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,576
Just do it.

44
00:09:53,351 --> 00:09:55,819
Looks like our man.
Burn scars on his face.

45
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,017
I wonder if bomb-makers
are insured for things like that.

46
00:10:15,873 --> 00:10:17,272
He's on the move.

47
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,377
He's on the move,
and he's heading straight for me.

48
00:10:21,212 --> 00:10:23,271
Stop touching your ear.

49
00:10:23,481 --> 00:10:25,540
- Sorry?
- Put your hand down.

50
00:10:32,023 --> 00:10:34,514
Holster the bloody weapon, Carter.
I need him alive.

51
00:20:05,562 --> 00:20:08,463
Weeping blood comes merely
from a derangement of the tear duct...

52
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,064
...my dear general.

53
00:20:11,034 --> 00:20:12,296
Nothing sinister.

54
00:20:17,574 --> 00:20:18,939
All in.

55
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,871
I have two pair, and you have
a 17.4 percent chance...

56
00:20:25,082 --> 00:20:27,175
...of making your straight.

57
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,942
When does Ellipsis expire?

58
00:20:56,146 --> 00:20:59,309
- We have less than 36 hours. I can...
- No. No, no.

59
00:20:59,516 --> 00:21:02,246
That's all the time I have anyway.

60
00:21:03,987 --> 00:21:06,182
Give our guests
five minutes to leave...

61
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,688
...or throw them overboard.

62
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,000
Who the hell do they think they are?

63
00:21:22,205 --> 00:21:24,696
I report to the prime minister,
even he's smart enough...

64
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,102
...not to ask me what we do.

65
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:30,007
Have you ever seen such a bunch
of self-righteous, arse-covering prigs?

66
00:21:30,213 --> 00:21:33,011
They don't care what we do, they care
what we get photographed doing.

67
00:21:33,317 --> 00:21:35,877
And how the hell
could Bond be so stupid?

68
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,953
I give him double-0 status,
he celebrates by shooting an embassy.

69
00:21:39,156 --> 00:21:41,556
Is the man deranged?
And where the hell is he?

70
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:44,283
In the old days, if an agent
did something embarrassing...

71
00:21:44,494 --> 00:21:46,121
...he'd have the good sense
to defect.

72
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,161
Christ, I miss the Cold War.

73
00:23:04,808 --> 00:23:06,469
You've got a bloody cheek.

74
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:08,167
Sorry.

75
00:23:08,378 --> 00:23:10,175
I'll shoot the camera first next time.

76
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,041
Or yourself.

77
00:23:12,249 --> 00:23:14,274
You stormed into an embassy.

78
00:23:14,484 --> 00:23:17,009
You violated the only
absolutely inviolate rule...

79
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,812
...of international relationships.

80
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,956
And why?
So you could kill a nobody.

81
00:23:21,158 --> 00:23:22,853
We wanted to question him,
not kill him.

82
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,262
For God's sake. You're supposed
to display some kind of judgment.

83
00:23:27,464 --> 00:23:28,522
I did.

84
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,724
I thought one less bomb-maker
in the world would be good.

85
00:23:31,935 --> 00:23:33,732
Exactly. One bomb-maker.

86
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:37,765
We're trying to find out how an entire
network of terrorist groups is financed...

87
00:23:37,974 --> 00:23:39,464
...and you give us one bomb-maker.

88
00:23:39,676 --> 00:23:41,803
Hardly the big picture,
wouldn't you say?

89
00:23:42,012 --> 00:23:45,243
The man isn't even a true believer.
He's a gun for hire.

90
00:23:45,449 --> 00:23:47,280
And thanks to your trigger finger...

91
00:23:47,484 --> 00:23:50,351
...we have no idea
who hired him or why.

92
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,886
And how the hell
did you find out where I lived?

93
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,682
The same way
I found out your name.

94
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:57,826
I thought "M" was randomly assigned.
I had no idea it stood for...

95
00:23:58,028 --> 00:24:00,496
Utter one more syllable
and I'll have you killed.

96
00:24:01,998 --> 00:24:04,694
I knew it was too early
to promote you.

97
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:09,171
Well, I understand double-0s
have a very short life-expectancy...

98
00:24:09,372 --> 00:24:11,567
...so your mistake will be short-lived.

99
00:24:17,814 --> 00:24:22,717
Bond, this may be too much
for a blunt instrument to understand...

100
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,286
...but arrogance and self-awareness
seldom go hand in hand.

101
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:29,619
So you want me to be half monk,
half hit-man?

102
00:24:29,826 --> 00:24:31,691
Any thug can kill.

103
00:24:31,895 --> 00:24:34,295
I want you to take your ego
out of the equation...

104
00:24:34,498 --> 00:24:37,023
...and to judge the situation
dispassionately.

105
00:24:37,901 --> 00:24:40,995
I have to know I can trust you,
and that you know who to trust.

106
00:24:42,305 --> 00:24:45,832
And since I don't know that,
I need you out of my sight.

107
00:24:46,042 --> 00:24:48,067
Go and stick your head
in the sand somewhere...

108
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,643
...and think about your future.

109
00:24:49,846 --> 00:24:52,747
Because these bastards
want your head.

110
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:56,407
And I'm seriously considering
feeding you to them.

111
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,751
And Bond...

112
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:11,760
...don't ever break into
my house again.

113
00:25:12,736 --> 00:25:14,636
Ma'am.

114
00:26:27,344 --> 00:26:30,177
Good day, sir,
and welcome to the Ocean Club.

115
00:26:35,185 --> 00:26:37,415
Hey. Hey.

116
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:51,226
Hello.

117
00:26:51,434 --> 00:26:53,561
Are you going to take this
or make me wait?

118
00:26:54,604 --> 00:26:57,072
Certainly, sir. Sorry, sir.

119
00:27:40,483 --> 00:27:43,418
<i>Security to car park.</i>
<i>Security to car park.</i>

120
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,315
Absolutely incredible.

121
00:29:24,421 --> 00:29:26,912
Welcome to the Ocean Club, sir.
Checking in?

122
00:29:27,123 --> 00:29:30,559
Yes. But it's a spur-of-the-moment
thing, and I haven't got a reservation.

123
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,159
Okay.

124
00:29:33,663 --> 00:29:37,030
- We have an ocean-view villa.
- Perfect.

125
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,402
Could you do me a favor?
I was here last night...

126
00:29:42,605 --> 00:29:46,564
...and I parked my car next to
a very beautiful 1964 Aston Martin.

127
00:29:46,776 --> 00:29:48,869
I nicked the door.
You wouldn't happen to know...?

128
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,513
- Mr. Dimitrios.
- Right.

129
00:29:52,148 --> 00:29:54,446
If he hasn't noticed,
I'm not sure I'd mention it.

130
00:29:54,651 --> 00:29:56,346
Isn't the type
to take bad news well.

131
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,189
But if I felt compelled to find him?

132
00:30:01,324 --> 00:30:03,451
He has a house just up the beach.

133
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:06,392
Thank you.

134
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:10,186
- What?
- He's in the Bahamas.

135
00:31:10,393 --> 00:31:12,827
You woke me
to share his holiday plans?

136
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:14,997
Well, he's logged into
our secure website...

137
00:31:15,198 --> 00:31:17,257
...using your name and password.

138
00:31:17,467 --> 00:31:20,334
Well, how the hell
does he know these things?

139
00:31:20,537 --> 00:31:22,903
<i>Well, I'm doing my best to find out.</i>

140
00:31:23,106 --> 00:31:26,974
- Who's he looking at?
- <i>Alex Dimitrios.</i>

141
00:31:27,377 --> 00:31:29,004
That slimy bugger.

142
00:31:39,589 --> 00:31:41,489
Now known associates...

143
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:54,636
Le Chiffre.

144
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,716
We've had a good night,
we've had a few drinks.

145
00:32:14,657 --> 00:32:16,386
How can I assist you, sir?

146
00:32:16,593 --> 00:32:18,823
Good evening.
Large Mount Gay with soda, please.

147
00:32:19,696 --> 00:32:21,664
- Look what just happened.
- Good job, big boy.

148
00:32:21,864 --> 00:32:23,092
Yeah.

149
00:32:30,974 --> 00:32:31,941
Do you mind if I join?

150
00:32:32,141 --> 00:32:34,371
- Oh, good evening. How are you?
- Good evening.

151
00:32:46,022 --> 00:32:47,956
Small blind, big blind.

152
00:32:48,157 --> 00:32:49,818
I'm in.

153
00:32:52,228 --> 00:32:53,923
Bet's to you.

154
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,363
If that was for luck,
you're two hours late.

155
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:03,200
Two hundred to you.

156
00:33:08,077 --> 00:33:09,339
Bet's to you.

157
00:33:09,545 --> 00:33:11,035
I heard you.

158
00:33:11,681 --> 00:33:13,444
Five to call.

159
00:33:17,053 --> 00:33:18,350
- Action's to you.
- Pair of sevens.

160
00:33:18,554 --> 00:33:19,919
Ace high.

161
00:33:21,591 --> 00:33:23,058
Check or bet.

162
00:33:23,259 --> 00:33:24,749
- Check.
- And to you.

163
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,895
Five thousand.

164
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,298
Five to call.

165
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,513
- Check.
- Check to you, sir.

166
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:49,512
All in.

167
00:33:50,186 --> 00:33:51,983
No, wait.

168
00:33:52,388 --> 00:33:53,855
Twenty thousand.

169
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,590
Table stakes. I'm sorry, sir.

170
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:03,189
Okay. This is on the table.
That's my car. Wanna bet?

171
00:34:04,867 --> 00:34:06,732
I'm sorry, Mr. Dimitrios.

172
00:34:06,936 --> 00:34:09,928
Please, no. Give him a chance
to win his money back.

173
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:21,878
All right, show me, gentlemen.

174
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:28,322
Three kings.

175
00:34:34,497 --> 00:34:36,260
There you go with my night.

176
00:34:36,466 --> 00:34:37,865
Trip aces.

177
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:40,160
Aces win.

178
00:34:43,906 --> 00:34:45,203
Oh, and the valet ticket.

179
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:50,978
Thank you.

180
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,647
Sir.

181
00:35:24,814 --> 00:35:27,146
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

182
00:35:28,184 --> 00:35:31,347
No wonder he was
in such a foul mood.

183
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,782
My mistake.

184
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,252
Can I give you a lift home?

185
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:39,292
That would really send him
over the edge.

186
00:35:39,495 --> 00:35:41,429
I'm afraid I'm not that cruel.

187
00:35:41,731 --> 00:35:43,722
Well, perhaps you're just
out of practice.

188
00:35:51,507 --> 00:35:52,804
Perhaps.

189
00:35:53,009 --> 00:35:54,738
Well, what about
a drink at my place?

190
00:35:55,645 --> 00:35:57,636
Your place?

191
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,913
- Is it close?
- Very.

192
00:36:07,323 --> 00:36:09,188
One drink.

193
00:36:34,517 --> 00:36:36,109
Good evening, sir,
and welcome back.

194
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,219
Welcome to my home.

195
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:53,526
<i>I'm having a hard time seeing</i>
<i>how this is my fault.</i>

196
00:36:53,736 --> 00:36:56,398
It's your plan.
All I did was get you the man.

197
00:36:56,606 --> 00:37:01,100
A man who was under surveillance
by the British Secret Service.

198
00:37:02,912 --> 00:37:05,380
Which makes me wonder
if I can trust you at all.

199
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:08,149
Then don't. I couldn't care less.

200
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,319
But I do care about my reputation.

201
00:37:11,287 --> 00:37:13,517
I have someone else
willing to do the job.

202
00:37:13,723 --> 00:37:15,520
He just needs the particulars...

203
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,122
...and payment.

204
00:37:29,138 --> 00:37:32,733
You like married women,
don't you, James?

205
00:37:32,942 --> 00:37:35,137
It keeps things simple.

206
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,878
What is it about bad men?

207
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:44,052
You, my husband...

208
00:37:44,253 --> 00:37:46,915
I had so many chances
to be happy...

209
00:37:47,123 --> 00:37:49,489
...so many nice guys.

210
00:37:49,692 --> 00:37:52,388
Why can't nice guys
be more like you?

211
00:37:52,595 --> 00:37:54,825
Well, because then they'd be bad.

212
00:37:55,765 --> 00:37:58,029
Yes.

213
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:03,603
But so much more interesting.

214
00:38:08,044 --> 00:38:10,478
What makes your husband
a bad man?

215
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,240
His nature, I suppose.

216
00:38:13,449 --> 00:38:15,110
The nature of his work?

217
00:38:15,318 --> 00:38:18,981
A mystery, I'm afraid.

218
00:38:19,655 --> 00:38:24,957
I'm also afraid you will sleep with me
in order to get to him.

219
00:38:25,161 --> 00:38:27,629
How afraid?

220
00:38:28,197 --> 00:38:30,995
Not enough to stop.

221
00:38:38,574 --> 00:38:40,735
Can I ask you a personal question?

222
00:38:42,411 --> 00:38:46,074
Now would seem
an appropriate time.

223
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,648
Does "ellipsis"
mean anything to you?

224
00:38:57,994 --> 00:38:59,962
Should I ask him about it?

225
00:39:00,162 --> 00:39:02,494
Perhaps later.

226
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,626
Yes, dear?

227
00:39:04,834 --> 00:39:06,734
<i>I'm on the last flight</i>
<i>tonight to Miami.</i>

228
00:39:06,936 --> 00:39:09,564
<i>Don't wait up.</i>
<i>I'll be back in the morning.</i>

229
00:39:09,772 --> 00:39:12,104
Okay, I understand.

230
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:15,072
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

231
00:39:16,612 --> 00:39:21,015
Apparently he's on
the last flight to Miami...

232
00:39:21,217 --> 00:39:25,381
...so you have all night
to question me.

233
00:39:28,224 --> 00:39:29,691
In that case...

234
00:39:29,892 --> 00:39:31,018
...we're gonna need...

235
00:39:31,227 --> 00:39:33,593
...some more champagne.

236
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:40,901
<i>Good evening. Room Service.</i>

237
00:39:41,103 --> 00:39:44,903
Good evening. Can I get a bottle
of chilled Bollinger Grand Année...

238
00:39:45,107 --> 00:39:46,335
...and the beluga caviar?

239
00:39:46,542 --> 00:39:49,010
- <i>With everything?</i>
- Yes, with everything.

240
00:39:49,211 --> 00:39:51,304
- <i>And would that be for two, sir?</i>
- What?

241
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:54,779
- <i>For two?</i>
- No, for one.

242
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:29,612
Wait here.

243
00:40:33,689 --> 00:40:36,852
There you go. Number 53.

244
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:43,196
<i>Dr. Von Hagens' Body Worlds</i>
<i>invites visitors...</i>

245
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:46,232
<i>... to observe the body's various</i>

00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:52,199
<i>Please may I have your attention,</i>

248
00:41:53,836 --> 00:41:57,101
<i>I believe it is something very special,</i>
<i>what we see here.</i>

249
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,466
<i>This is edutainment.</i>

250
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,995
- <i>fixed in dramatic</i>

<i>... that reveal the true-to-life spatial</i>
<i>relationships amongst organs.</i>

252
00:42:45,221 --> 00:42:46,745
Hello.

253
00:42:46,956 --> 00:42:48,856
Hello.

254
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:01,025
<i>Do not leave your vehicle unattended.</i>

255
00:43:01,237 --> 00:43:03,797
<i>Welcome to Miami</i>
<i>International Airport.</i>

256
00:43:04,006 --> 00:43:07,134
<i>Curbside parking in front</i>
<i>of the terminal is restricted...</i>

257
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:45,129
- Yes.
- It's Bond. I need her now.

258
00:44:45,341 --> 00:44:48,071
I'm afraid she can't be disturbed.
Can I take a message?

259
00:44:48,277 --> 00:44:51,542
Listen, you go and find her, tell her
to call Security at Miami Airport...

260
00:44:51,747 --> 00:44:54,307
...because I think a bomb is about
to go off. Do it now.

261
00:44:54,783 --> 00:44:57,445
- Sorry, can I put you on hold?
- I thought you might.

262
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:04,620
Bond? What the hell are you up to?

263
00:45:07,463 --> 00:45:08,452
I'll call you back.

264
00:45:31,253 --> 00:45:33,517
- The Skyfleet S570 prototype.
- What about it?

265
00:45:33,722 --> 00:45:37,055
"The largest airplane in the world will
be unveiled today at Miami Airport."

266
00:46:18,434 --> 00:46:19,458
Oh, my God!

267
00:46:19,668 --> 00:46:21,260
<i>Bond? Bond!</i>

268
00:46:24,273 --> 00:46:26,366
His target is the Skyfleet prototype.

269
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,509
<i>It's launching today.</i>

270
00:46:31,547 --> 00:46:32,707
I gotta go.

271
00:50:58,046 --> 00:50:59,775
Stop! Stop!

272
00:52:02,544 --> 00:52:04,409
Get moving!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

273
00:53:37,539 --> 00:53:42,306
The puts expired. I'm sorry,
I'm not sure yet how much you've lost.

274
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:47,915
One hundred and one million,
two hundred and six thousand dollars.

275
00:53:54,456 --> 00:53:56,617
Someone talked.

276
00:54:20,448 --> 00:54:22,348
- You got everything you need?
- Yeah, I have.

277
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:24,610
I'm gonna get a few more photos...

278
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,026
Quite the body count
you're stacking up.

279
00:54:42,837 --> 00:54:45,567
She was tortured first.
As you'd already killed her husband...

280
00:54:45,774 --> 00:54:48,402
...she must have been
the only one left to question.

281
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:51,203
Did she know anything
that could compromise you?

282
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:52,380
No.

283
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:56,039
- Not your name, what you were after?
- No.

284
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:57,684
Dimitrios worked as a middleman.

285
00:54:57,886 --> 00:54:59,649
Knew where to put his hands
on weapons...

286
00:54:59,854 --> 00:55:01,287
...and people who could use them.

287
00:55:01,489 --> 00:55:03,116
He worked with anyone
who had money.

288
00:55:03,325 --> 00:55:06,692
For years he was involved with a man
we knew as Le Chiffre...

289
00:55:06,895 --> 00:55:08,795
...a private banker
to the world's terrorists.

290
00:55:08,997 --> 00:55:12,455
He invested their money, gave them
access to it wherever they wanted.

291
00:55:12,667 --> 00:55:14,430
Oh, good. You're here.

292
00:55:14,636 --> 00:55:17,196
Albanian, we believe.
Chess prodigy.

293
00:55:17,405 --> 00:55:21,967
A bit of a mathematical genius
and liked to prove it by playing poker.

294
00:55:51,239 --> 00:55:52,729
So you can keep an eye on me?

295
00:55:54,075 --> 00:55:55,565
Yes.

296
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:03,610
When they analyzed
the stock market after 9<i>l</i>11...

297
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:07,117
...the CIA discovered a massive
shorting of airline stocks.

298
00:56:07,956 --> 00:56:11,153
When the stocks hit bottom on 9<i>l</i>12,
somebody made a fortune.

299
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:14,420
The same thing happened
this morning with Skyfleet stock...

300
00:56:14,629 --> 00:56:15,857
...or was supposed to.

301
00:56:16,064 --> 00:56:19,830
With their prototype destroyed, the
company would be near bankruptcy.

302
00:56:20,035 --> 00:56:24,062
Instead, somebody lost over
$ 100 million betting the wrong way.

303
00:56:25,073 --> 00:56:26,973
You think it's this man Le Chiffre.

304
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:30,110
Which would explain how he could
set up a high-stakes poker game...

305
00:56:30,311 --> 00:56:32,006
...at Casino Royale in Montenegro.

306
00:56:32,213 --> 00:56:36,274
Ten players, $ 10 million buy-in,
5 million re-buy.

307
00:56:36,484 --> 00:56:39,248
Winner takes all.
Potentially 150 million.

308
00:56:39,454 --> 00:56:42,014
Good.
Then we'll know where he'll be.

309
00:56:42,223 --> 00:56:44,191
Do you want a clean kill
or to send a message?

310
00:56:44,392 --> 00:56:48,658
We want him alive. Le Chiffre
doesn't have 100 million to lose.

311
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:52,264
Has he been playing the stock market
with his clients' funds?

312
00:56:52,467 --> 00:56:55,300
They're not gonna be too happy
when they find out it's gone.

313
00:56:55,503 --> 00:56:56,868
We can't let him win this game.

314
00:56:57,072 --> 00:56:59,302
If he loses,
he'll have nowhere to run.

315
00:56:59,507 --> 00:57:02,340
We'll give him sanctuary
in return for everything he knows.

316
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,273
I'm putting you in the game...

317
00:57:04,479 --> 00:57:07,141
...replacing someone
who's playing for a syndicate.

318
00:57:07,348 --> 00:57:10,909
According to Villiers,
you're the best player in the Service.

319
00:57:11,319 --> 00:57:13,150
Trust me, I wish it wasn't the case.

320
00:57:17,792 --> 00:57:22,126
I would ask you if you could remain
emotionally detached...

321
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:25,493
...but I don't think
that's your problem, is it, Bond?

322
00:57:26,201 --> 00:57:28,032
No.

323
00:57:30,105 --> 00:57:31,732
Don't worry about keeping in touch.

324
00:57:32,974 --> 00:57:34,271
We'll know where you are.

325
00:57:34,476 --> 00:57:35,841
You can stop pretending.

326
00:57:36,711 --> 00:57:38,736
You knew I wouldn't let this drop,
didn't you?

327
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:42,212
Well, I knew you were you.

328
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:02,464
Thank you.

329
00:58:09,477 --> 00:58:10,842
I'm the money.

330
00:58:13,148 --> 00:58:14,410
Every penny of it.

331
00:58:16,851 --> 00:58:18,944
The Treasury has agreed
to stake you in the game.

332
00:58:20,321 --> 00:58:21,982
"Vesper."

333
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:24,681
Well, I do hope you gave
your parents hell for that.

334
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,893
Thank you.

335
00:58:27,095 --> 00:58:28,756
Your boss must be well-connected.

336
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:31,397
I've never seen so much
go out the door so quickly.

337
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,627
Or quite so stylishly.

338
00:58:35,737 --> 00:58:37,170
May I ask you where it is?

339
00:58:37,372 --> 00:58:39,897
Ten million was wired
to your account in Montenegro...

340
00:58:40,108 --> 00:58:44,442
...with a contingency for 5 more
if I deem it a prudent investment.

341
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:47,672
I suppose you've given some thought
to the notion that if you lose...

342
00:58:47,882 --> 00:58:50,783
...our government
will have directly financed terrorism.

343
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:55,554
What looks good?

344
00:59:02,797 --> 00:59:05,595
So you're telling me it's a matter
of probability and odds.

345
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,768
I was worried there was
some chance involved.

346
00:59:07,969 --> 00:59:10,631
Well, only if you assume the player
with the best hand wins.

347
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:13,072
So that would be
what you call "bluffing"?

348
00:59:16,144 --> 00:59:17,941
You've heard the term.

349
00:59:18,146 --> 00:59:20,637
Then you'll also know that in poker
you never play your hand.

350
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:22,214
You play the man across from you.

351
00:59:22,417 --> 00:59:24,783
- And you're good at reading people?
- Yes, I am.

352
00:59:24,986 --> 00:59:26,681
Which is why
I've been able to detect...

353
00:59:26,888 --> 00:59:29,015
...an undercurrent
of sarcasm in your voice.

354
00:59:29,724 --> 00:59:32,591
I'm now assured our money
is in good hands.

355
00:59:33,661 --> 00:59:35,856
You don't think
this is a very good plan, do you?

356
00:59:36,064 --> 00:59:37,554
So there is a plan?

357
00:59:37,765 --> 00:59:40,325
I got the impression
we were risking millions of dollars...

358
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,765
...and hundreds of lives
on a game of luck.

359
00:59:42,971 --> 00:59:44,996
What else can you surmise,
Mr. Bond?

360
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:47,367
About you, Miss Lynd?

361
00:59:47,575 --> 00:59:49,167
Well, your beauty's a problem.

362
00:59:49,644 --> 00:59:51,635
You worry you won't
be taken seriously.

363
00:59:51,846 --> 00:59:54,838
Which one can say of any
attractive woman with half a brain.

364
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:56,607
True, but this one
overcompensates...

365
00:59:56,818 --> 00:59:58,649
...by wearing
slightly masculine clothing...

366
00:59:58,853 --> 01:00:01,219
...being more aggressive
than her female colleagues...

367
01:00:01,422 --> 01:00:03,890
...which gives her a somewhat
prickly demeanor...

368
01:00:04,092 --> 01:00:07,425
...and ironically enough, makes it
less likely for her to be accepted...

369
01:00:07,629 --> 01:00:09,824
...and promoted
by her male superiors...

370
01:00:10,031 --> 01:00:12,795
...who mistake her insecurities
for arrogance.

371
01:00:13,301 --> 01:00:17,328
Now, I'd have normally
gone with only child...

372
01:00:17,538 --> 01:00:20,632
...but, you see, by the way you ignored
the quip about your parents...

373
01:00:20,842 --> 01:00:23,504
...I'm gonna have to go with orphan.

374
01:00:26,481 --> 01:00:28,415
All right.

375
01:00:29,284 --> 01:00:31,844
By the cut of your suit,
you went to Oxford or wherever...

376
01:00:32,053 --> 01:00:34,419
...and actually think
human beings dress like that.

377
01:00:34,622 --> 01:00:36,522
But you wear it with such disdain...

378
01:00:36,724 --> 01:00:38,624
...my guess is
you didn't come from money...

379
01:00:38,826 --> 01:00:41,386
...and your school friends
never let you forget it.

380
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:43,530
Which means you were
at that school by the grace...

381
01:00:43,731 --> 01:00:46,598
...of someone else's charity,
hence the chip on your shoulder.

382
01:00:46,801 --> 01:00:49,292
And since your first thought about me
ran to orphan...

383
01:00:49,504 --> 01:00:51,495
...that's what I'd say you are.

384
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:57,434
Oh, you are.

385
01:00:57,912 --> 01:00:59,743
I like this poker thing.

386
01:00:59,948 --> 01:01:01,711
And that makes perfect sense...

387
01:01:01,916 --> 01:01:04,316
...since Ml6 looks
for maladjusted young men...

388
01:01:04,519 --> 01:01:06,783
...that give little thought
to sacrificing others...

389
01:01:06,988 --> 01:01:09,183
...in order to protect
Queen and country.

390
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:10,482
You know...

391
01:01:10,692 --> 01:01:14,628
...former SAS types with easy smiles
and expensive watches.

392
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:17,495
- Rolex?
- Omega.

393
01:01:17,699 --> 01:01:19,530
Beautiful.

394
01:01:20,034 --> 01:01:21,695
Now, having just met you...

395
01:01:21,903 --> 01:01:24,736
...I wouldn't go as far as calling you
a cold-hearted bastard.

396
01:01:24,939 --> 01:01:26,304
No, of course not.

397
01:01:26,507 --> 01:01:28,202
But it wouldn't be a stretch
to imagine.

398
01:01:28,409 --> 01:01:30,570
You think of women
as disposable pleasures...

399
01:01:30,778 --> 01:01:32,871
...rather than meaningful pursuits.

400
01:01:34,349 --> 01:01:36,476
So as charming as you are,
Mr. Bond...

401
01:01:36,684 --> 01:01:39,118
...I will be keeping my eye
on our government's money...

402
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,288
...and off your perfectly formed arse.

403
01:01:41,756 --> 01:01:43,280
You noticed?

404
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:45,482
Even accountants have imagination.

405
01:01:45,693 --> 01:01:47,024
How was your lamb?

406
01:01:47,428 --> 01:01:48,986
Skewered.

407
01:01:49,197 --> 01:01:50,824
One sympathizes.

408
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:54,157
Good evening, Mr. Bond.

409
01:01:54,369 --> 01:01:56,701
Good evening, Miss Lynd.

410
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:15,189
- Hotel Splendid, sir?
- That's right.

411
01:02:17,458 --> 01:02:19,688
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

412
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:36,005
It's just last-minute details.

413
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:39,441
Apparently we're very much in love.

414
01:02:40,181 --> 01:02:43,150
Do you usually leave it to porters
to tell you this sort of thing?

415
01:02:43,351 --> 01:02:46,047
Only when the romance
has been necessarily brief.

416
01:02:46,454 --> 01:02:49,423
I'm Mr. Arlington Beech,
professional gambler...

417
01:02:49,624 --> 01:02:51,182
...and you're
Miss Stephanie Broadchest...

418
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:53,587
- I am not.
- You're gonna have to trust me on this.

419
01:02:53,795 --> 01:02:55,763
Oh, no, I don't.

420
01:02:55,963 --> 01:02:57,863
We've been involved
for quite a while...

421
01:02:58,599 --> 01:03:00,362
...hence the shared suite.

422
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:02,934
But my family
is strict Roman Catholic...

423
01:03:03,137 --> 01:03:05,867
...so for appearances' sake,
it'll be a two-bedroom suite.

424
01:03:06,074 --> 01:03:09,339
I do hate it when religion
comes between us.

425
01:03:09,644 --> 01:03:12,044
Religion and a securely locked door.

426
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:14,214
Am I going to have a problem
with you, Bond?

427
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:17,179
No, don't worry. You're not my type.

428
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:18,510
Smart?

429
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,815
Single.

430
01:03:40,041 --> 01:03:42,032
Welcome to the Hotel Splendid.
Your name, sir?

431
01:03:42,243 --> 01:03:45,110
James Bond. You'll find
the reservation under Beech.

432
01:03:45,313 --> 01:03:48,043
- Welcome, Mr. Bond.
- You sign that, dear.

433
01:03:48,683 --> 01:03:51,015
You represent the Treasury.

434
01:03:55,356 --> 01:03:58,018
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

435
01:03:58,226 --> 01:03:59,818
I will. Thank you.

436
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:03,990
Very funny.

437
01:04:04,198 --> 01:04:06,166
Look, if Le Chiffre
is that well-connected...

438
01:04:06,367 --> 01:04:08,494
...he knows who I am
and where the money's from.

439
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:10,864
Which means he's decided
to play me anyway.

440
01:04:11,072 --> 01:04:13,438
So he's either desperate
or he's overly confident...

441
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:15,939
...but either way, that tells me
something about him.

442
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:18,669
And all he gets in return
is a name he already has.

443
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,607
And now he knows
something about you.

444
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:23,010
He knows you're reckless.

445
01:04:23,618 --> 01:04:25,449
Take the next one.

446
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:28,520
There isn't enough room for me
and your ego.

447
01:04:28,923 --> 01:04:30,481
Mr. Bond?

448
01:04:30,691 --> 01:04:33,023
- It was left for you.
- Thank you.

449
01:05:04,158 --> 01:05:05,682
I love you too, M.

450
01:05:44,865 --> 01:05:50,064
My name is Mathis. Rene Mathis.
I'm your contact here.

451
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:55,132
Does he know
we've been watching him?

452
01:05:55,343 --> 01:05:58,005
Le Chiffre? I don't think so.

453
01:05:58,212 --> 01:06:02,546
Probably because there's no "we."
Just me.

454
01:06:03,184 --> 01:06:05,152
I'm afraid if you get
into trouble here...

455
01:06:05,353 --> 01:06:09,084
...the cavalry won't be
coming over the nearest hill.

456
01:06:10,625 --> 01:06:12,422
Le Chiffre arrived yesterday...

457
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:16,387
...and spent the time reestablishing
old relationships.

458
01:06:16,998 --> 01:06:19,933
The chief of police and he
are now quite close.

459
01:06:20,134 --> 01:06:22,034
That's him, with the mustache.

460
01:06:22,236 --> 01:06:23,794
Over my left shoulder.

461
01:06:24,872 --> 01:06:27,067
Well, that could make life
quite difficult.

462
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:29,243
Yeah, and quite possibly shorter.

463
01:06:29,443 --> 01:06:32,071
He's not a very subtle man.

464
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,443
I thought about trying to buy
his services, but we frankly...

465
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:38,847
...couldn't afford to outbid Le Chiffre.

466
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:48,121
I hate to say it...

467
01:06:48,329 --> 01:06:52,288
...but the accountants seem
to be running Ml6 these days.

468
01:06:53,367 --> 01:06:56,564
Oh, not that I have anything
against accountants.

469
01:06:56,771 --> 01:06:59,035
Many of them are lovely people.

470
01:07:00,574 --> 01:07:03,668
So I decided that it was cheaper
to supply his deputy...

471
01:07:03,878 --> 01:07:07,473
...with evidence
that we were bribing the chief.

472
01:07:07,682 --> 01:07:12,016
It's amazing what you can do with
Photoshop these days, isn't it?

473
01:07:14,955 --> 01:07:17,583
I think your odds are improving,
Mr. Bond.

474
01:07:23,064 --> 01:07:24,429
Yes?

475
01:07:25,099 --> 01:07:26,760
For you.

476
01:07:27,935 --> 01:07:30,426
Something you expect me to wear?

477
01:07:32,907 --> 01:07:34,238
I need you looking fabulous.

478
01:07:34,442 --> 01:07:36,740
So when you walk up behind me
and kiss me on the neck...

479
01:07:36,944 --> 01:07:39,310
...the players will be thinking
about your neckline...

480
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:41,242
...and not about their cards.

481
01:07:41,449 --> 01:07:43,849
Do you think you can
do that for me?

482
01:07:44,051 --> 01:07:45,985
I'll do my best.

483
01:07:47,054 --> 01:07:48,988
Thank you.

484
01:08:01,001 --> 01:08:02,229
I have a dinner jacket.

485
01:08:03,437 --> 01:08:05,769
There are dinner jackets
and dinner jackets.

486
01:08:05,973 --> 01:08:07,133
This is the latter.

487
01:08:07,341 --> 01:08:10,538
And I need you looking like a man
who belongs at that table.

488
01:08:10,978 --> 01:08:12,605
How...?

489
01:08:13,414 --> 01:08:14,881
It's tailored.

490
01:08:15,082 --> 01:08:17,642
I sized you up the moment we met.

491
01:09:11,338 --> 01:09:13,966
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

492
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:17,571
Thank you.

493
01:09:28,355 --> 01:09:30,482
And you must be
Mr. Bliss' replacement.

494
01:09:30,691 --> 01:09:32,784
Welcome, Mr. Beech.

495
01:09:33,994 --> 01:09:36,792
Or is that Bond?
I'm a little confused.

496
01:09:36,997 --> 01:09:39,431
Well, we wouldn't want that,
would we?

497
01:09:48,876 --> 01:09:50,867
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

498
01:09:51,078 --> 01:09:53,672
As you know, the game is no-limit
hold 'em poker.

499
01:09:53,881 --> 01:09:55,815
Five communal cards,
two in the hole.

500
01:09:56,283 --> 01:09:59,047
Monsieur Mendel here represents
the Basel Bank, Switzerland...

501
01:09:59,253 --> 01:10:00,481
...holding the stakes.

502
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:05,315
You have each deposited
$ 10 million buy-in.

503
01:10:05,526 --> 01:10:08,427
A further buy-in of 5 million
can be made by electronic transfer.

504
01:10:08,629 --> 01:10:10,722
The money will remain in escrow
until I return...

505
01:10:10,931 --> 01:10:13,661
...and the winner of the contest
enters his or her password...

506
01:10:13,868 --> 01:10:15,028
...into the encryptor...

507
01:10:15,236 --> 01:10:16,965
...whereupon the entire sum
will be wired...

508
01:10:17,171 --> 01:10:19,298
...to any bank account
in the world you nominate.

509
01:10:19,874 --> 01:10:21,603
Mr. Bond?

510
01:10:22,042 --> 01:10:23,202
We proceed alphabetically.

511
01:10:23,410 --> 01:10:25,844
Please be so kind as to enter
a password of your choice.

512
01:10:34,255 --> 01:10:35,415
Six letters or more.

513
01:10:48,502 --> 01:10:51,164
High card for dealer position.

514
01:10:58,212 --> 01:10:59,509
It's Signor Gallardo.

515
01:10:59,713 --> 01:11:02,739
Mr. Kaminofsky is
the small blind, $5000...

516
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:06,408
...and Mr. Fukutu, the big blind,
$ 10,000.

517
01:11:08,522 --> 01:11:10,547
Well, enjoy the game.

518
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:35,507
Four players.

519
01:11:38,118 --> 01:11:39,449
It's your bet.

520
01:11:40,988 --> 01:11:42,455
Check.

521
01:11:42,656 --> 01:11:44,453
Check.

522
01:11:48,762 --> 01:11:50,821
Bet. Fifty thousand.

523
01:12:04,044 --> 01:12:05,306
Call.

524
01:12:08,582 --> 01:12:09,844
Fold.

525
01:12:12,052 --> 01:12:14,452
Fold. Heads up.

526
01:12:18,759 --> 01:12:20,192
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

527
01:12:31,705 --> 01:12:34,265
Bet. One hundred thousand.

528
01:12:37,378 --> 01:12:40,370
Weren't you supposed to enter
so the others could see you?

529
01:12:40,581 --> 01:12:43,607
Was I? Forgive me.

530
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:46,346
Good luck, darling.

531
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:52,557
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

532
01:12:54,528 --> 01:12:55,722
Monsieur Bond?

533
01:12:55,929 --> 01:12:58,591
Oh, I'm sorry. What was the bet?
A hundred thousand?

534
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,129
Call.

535
01:13:06,273 --> 01:13:07,433
Hello.

536
01:13:07,641 --> 01:13:11,236
I suppose I don't have to tell you
how beautiful you look.

537
01:13:11,445 --> 01:13:14,573
Half the people at that table
are still watching you.

538
01:13:14,782 --> 01:13:15,749
Champagne.

539
01:13:19,453 --> 01:13:21,318
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

540
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:33,696
Bet. Two hundred thousand.

541
01:13:40,107 --> 01:13:43,873
Monsieur, you have been called.
Showdown, please.

542
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:48,709
A full house to Monsieur Le Chiffre.
Deuces full of nines.

543
01:13:48,916 --> 01:13:50,713
Mr. Bond?

544
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:54,951
Fold.

545
01:14:02,329 --> 01:14:04,661
Send the barman over, please.

546
01:14:12,806 --> 01:14:15,604
A dry martini. Wait.

547
01:14:15,809 --> 01:14:17,504
Three measures Gordon's,
one of vodka...

548
01:14:17,711 --> 01:14:19,542
...half of Kina Lillet,
shake it over ice...

549
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:22,580
...then add a thin slice of lemon peel.
- Yes, sir.

550
01:14:22,783 --> 01:14:25,650
- You know, I'll have one of those.
- So will I.

551
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:27,848
Certainly.

552
01:14:28,789 --> 01:14:32,691
My friend, bring me one as well.
Keep the fruit.

553
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,891
That's it?

554
01:14:36,196 --> 01:14:37,788
Anyone want to play poker now?

555
01:14:37,998 --> 01:14:39,158
Someone's in a hurry.

556
01:14:48,175 --> 01:14:50,109
Would you excuse me?

557
01:15:03,624 --> 01:15:04,955
You taste nice.

558
01:15:05,159 --> 01:15:08,094
- I thought we dispensed with covers.
- No.

559
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:11,992
We dispensed with one that was
of no use and created another that is.

560
01:15:12,199 --> 01:15:13,723
- Is he watching?
- Yes.

561
01:15:13,934 --> 01:15:14,992
Good.

562
01:15:15,202 --> 01:15:17,966
This is me in character pissed off
because you're losing so fast...

563
01:15:18,172 --> 01:15:19,935
...we won't be here past midnight.

564
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:23,109
Oddly, my character's feelings
mirror my own.

565
01:15:23,744 --> 01:15:25,302
Check.

566
01:15:25,946 --> 01:15:27,777
- You know, that's not half bad.
- Up to you.

567
01:15:27,981 --> 01:15:29,881
I'm gonna have to think up
a name for that.

568
01:15:31,418 --> 01:15:33,978
It was worth it to discover his tell.

569
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:35,583
What do you mean?

570
01:15:35,956 --> 01:15:37,981
The twitch he has to hide
when he bluffs.

571
01:15:38,192 --> 01:15:42,322
- Bluffs? He had the best hand.
- Which he got on the last card.

572
01:15:42,529 --> 01:15:44,724
The odds against were 23-to-1,
and he'd know that.

573
01:15:44,932 --> 01:15:46,900
When he did his first raise
he had nothing.

574
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:48,624
Winning was blind luck.

575
01:15:48,836 --> 01:15:50,667
- Did you get the bug?
- Yes.

576
01:15:50,871 --> 01:15:52,736
Bet. One hundred thousand.

577
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:54,464
Thank you.

578
01:15:56,276 --> 01:15:57,709
It's your play, Monsieur Fukutu.

579
01:15:57,911 --> 01:16:00,937
Maybe he can actually pull this off.

580
01:16:01,782 --> 01:16:03,215
Call.

581
01:16:04,818 --> 01:16:06,786
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

582
01:16:09,323 --> 01:16:11,848
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mesdames, Messieurs...

583
01:16:12,059 --> 01:16:13,822
...we've now been
playing for four hours.

584
01:16:14,027 --> 01:16:18,487
It's time for a short break.
We will resume play in one hour.

585
01:16:47,327 --> 01:16:53,095
Well, I think I'll report
on the evening's frivolities.

586
01:16:54,701 --> 01:16:56,566
So?

587
01:16:56,770 --> 01:16:58,897
You want to do what to me?

588
01:16:59,106 --> 01:17:00,437
You've lost me completely.

589
01:17:00,641 --> 01:17:03,576
You just said you can't wait
to get me back to the room. Come on.

590
01:17:27,534 --> 01:17:31,163
So, what's so damn important?

591
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:35,199
I'm sorry.

592
01:17:38,078 --> 01:17:39,636
Where is my money?

593
01:17:44,184 --> 01:17:45,378
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

594
01:17:45,585 --> 01:17:47,815
You're holding a parcel for me.

595
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:54,120
Thank you.

596
01:17:55,395 --> 01:17:59,559
Do you think you can lose that kind
of money and no one would notice?

597
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:01,897
Your money is safe.

598
01:18:03,704 --> 01:18:05,433
Open that.

599
01:18:21,455 --> 01:18:23,514
You'll have it tomorrow.

600
01:18:24,458 --> 01:18:25,755
All of it.

601
01:18:39,239 --> 01:18:43,198
I would take a hand for this betrayal,
but you need it to play cards.

602
01:18:47,748 --> 01:18:49,477
Hold out your arm.

603
01:18:50,751 --> 01:18:52,548
Hold out your arm, my beauty...

604
01:18:53,186 --> 01:18:54,778
...or I will take your head.

605
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:07,633
Go to the room. Wait for me there.

606
01:19:20,981 --> 01:19:21,948
Stairs.

607
01:19:26,453 --> 01:19:29,081
Not a word of protest.

608
01:19:29,689 --> 01:19:32,249
You should find a new boyfriend.

609
01:21:17,397 --> 01:21:19,092
Go find Mathis.

610
01:21:19,299 --> 01:21:22,530
Tell him I've hidden the bodies here
and I want him to get rid of them.

611
01:21:22,736 --> 01:21:25,762
Do that now. Go. Go, go!

612
01:22:28,602 --> 01:22:31,196
You changed your shirt, Mr. Bond.

613
01:22:31,538 --> 01:22:35,235
I hope our little game
isn't causing you to perspire.

614
01:22:35,442 --> 01:22:36,670
A little.

615
01:22:36,876 --> 01:22:40,437
But I won't consider myself to be
in trouble until I start weeping blood.

616
01:22:40,647 --> 01:22:44,674
Ladies and gentlemen, if everybody's
ready, let's continue the game.

617
01:23:45,912 --> 01:23:50,281
It's like there's blood on my hands.
It's not coming off.

618
01:23:51,318 --> 01:23:53,183
Here, let's see.

619
01:24:08,768 --> 01:24:10,599
That's better.

620
01:24:14,674 --> 01:24:16,005
You cold?

621
01:24:16,209 --> 01:24:17,608
Yeah.

622
01:24:17,811 --> 01:24:19,711
Here.

623
01:25:16,436 --> 01:25:18,700
You have any trouble
with the bodies?

624
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:21,199
Less than some.

625
01:25:34,988 --> 01:25:38,719
Being dead doesn't mean
one can't still be helpful.

626
01:25:39,659 --> 01:25:42,355
That'll keep Le Chiffre
looking over his shoulder.

627
01:25:42,562 --> 01:25:44,792
He'll be wondering who's gonna
come for him next.

628
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:48,663
How's our girl?

629
01:25:49,202 --> 01:25:52,399
Melted your cold heart yet?

630
01:26:10,323 --> 01:26:11,517
Call.

631
01:26:11,724 --> 01:26:13,123
Fold.

632
01:26:13,326 --> 01:26:15,294
And call.

633
01:26:16,596 --> 01:26:18,655
Three players.

634
01:26:22,268 --> 01:26:24,031
Three hundred grand.

635
01:26:24,237 --> 01:26:25,898
Bet. Three hundred thousand.

636
01:26:27,774 --> 01:26:29,435
Call.

637
01:26:31,177 --> 01:26:32,144
And call.

638
01:26:37,317 --> 01:26:38,614
Three players.

639
01:26:42,956 --> 01:26:43,945
Check.

640
01:26:49,462 --> 01:26:50,622
Monsieur Bond?

641
01:27:00,507 --> 01:27:02,941
Bet. Five hundred thousand.

642
01:27:14,621 --> 01:27:18,921
Look. It's the tell. He is bluffing.

643
01:27:19,125 --> 01:27:21,150
My God, James was right.

644
01:27:22,262 --> 01:27:24,196
It's up to you.

645
01:27:30,336 --> 01:27:32,736
Raise. One million.

646
01:27:39,812 --> 01:27:42,178
Seems someone knows
something I don't.

647
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:44,410
Fold.

648
01:27:44,617 --> 01:27:46,380
Heads up, gentlemen.

649
01:27:46,586 --> 01:27:48,144
It's up to you.

650
01:28:02,335 --> 01:28:03,802
Two.

651
01:28:04,571 --> 01:28:06,664
Re-raise. Two million.

652
01:28:08,641 --> 01:28:10,700
And it's up to you.

653
01:28:21,788 --> 01:28:23,653
I'm all in.

654
01:28:31,064 --> 01:28:33,430
Well, it's 14 million
and 500,000.

655
01:28:33,633 --> 01:28:35,965
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

656
01:28:38,605 --> 01:28:42,974
Bond will have to go all in
to call his bluff.

657
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:46,640
- Call.
- Call.

658
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:49,446
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

659
01:28:51,184 --> 01:28:53,584
Full house. Kings and aces.

660
01:28:53,786 --> 01:28:55,811
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

661
01:29:08,768 --> 01:29:12,465
It's four jacks.
Monsieur Le Chiffre wins.

662
01:29:16,476 --> 01:29:19,639
You must have thought
I was bluffing, Mr. Bond.

663
01:29:20,313 --> 01:29:21,473
Please.

664
01:29:21,681 --> 01:29:23,979
We will now break for one hour.

665
01:29:24,183 --> 01:29:27,516
When we return,
the big blind will be 200,000.

666
01:29:34,961 --> 01:29:36,622
Good game.

667
01:30:04,757 --> 01:30:08,090
Well, I'm gonna need the other
5 million to buy back in.

668
01:30:08,661 --> 01:30:10,993
I can't do that, James.

669
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:13,931
Look, I made a mistake.

670
01:30:14,734 --> 01:30:17,726
I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant,
but I can beat him.

671
01:30:17,937 --> 01:30:19,370
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

672
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:21,873
Sorry?

673
01:30:22,075 --> 01:30:23,838
Try putting that in a sentence.

674
01:30:24,043 --> 01:30:25,442
"Sorry Le Chiffre's gonna win...

675
01:30:25,645 --> 01:30:27,977
...continue funding terror and killing."
That kind of sorry?

676
01:30:28,181 --> 01:30:31,241
You lost because of your ego,
and that same ego can't take it.

677
01:30:31,451 --> 01:30:32,850
That's what this is about.

678
01:30:33,052 --> 01:30:35,020
All you're going to do now
is lose more.

679
01:30:35,655 --> 01:30:36,815
Then you're an idiot.

680
01:30:37,023 --> 01:30:39,890
- I'm sorry?
- I said, you're a bloody idiot.

681
01:30:41,794 --> 01:30:44,058
Look in my eyes.

682
01:30:44,831 --> 01:30:46,594
I can beat this man, you know that.

683
01:30:49,235 --> 01:30:51,829
Get your hand off my arm.

684
01:31:14,727 --> 01:31:15,887
Vodka martini.

685
01:31:16,095 --> 01:31:18,893
- Shaken or stirred?
- Do I look like I give a damn?

686
01:31:37,083 --> 01:31:39,347
- James.
- Get the girl out.

687
01:31:46,626 --> 01:31:47,593
Funny game, right?

688
01:31:47,794 --> 01:31:50,888
Sorry, I should've introduced myself,
seeing as we're related.

689
01:31:51,631 --> 01:31:54,725
Felix Leiter, a brother from Langley.

690
01:31:56,736 --> 01:31:58,135
You should have a little faith.

691
01:31:58,337 --> 01:32:00,828
If you keep your head about you,
I think you have him.

692
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:03,304
Had. Excuse me.

693
01:32:03,743 --> 01:32:05,677
You're not buying in?

694
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:08,745
No.

695
01:32:12,084 --> 01:32:16,020
Listen, I'm bleeding chips.
I'm not gonna last much longer.

696
01:32:16,222 --> 01:32:18,884
You have a better chance.
I'll stake you.

697
01:32:19,959 --> 01:32:22,052
I'm saying I'll give you the money
to keep going.

698
01:32:22,261 --> 01:32:27,130
Just one thing. If you pull it off,
the CIA bring him in.

699
01:32:28,501 --> 01:32:30,833
And what about the winnings?

700
01:32:31,537 --> 01:32:34,097
Does it look like
we need the money?

701
01:32:45,651 --> 01:32:47,744
Shall we up the blinds?

702
01:32:49,956 --> 01:32:51,651
Why not?

703
01:32:55,127 --> 01:32:56,617
Bet.

704
01:32:58,698 --> 01:33:00,359
Raise.

705
01:33:15,882 --> 01:33:17,816
And fold.

706
01:33:20,052 --> 01:33:22,020
Excuse me, please.

707
01:33:23,723 --> 01:33:25,350
Call.

708
01:33:26,893 --> 01:33:28,053
Raise.

709
01:33:28,261 --> 01:33:31,719
Raise. Five hundred thousand.

710
01:33:34,233 --> 01:33:36,167
- Fold.
- Thank you.

711
01:33:38,537 --> 01:33:39,697
Fold.

712
01:33:43,976 --> 01:33:45,500
Fold.

713
01:33:50,416 --> 01:33:51,849
Thank you.

714
01:33:52,051 --> 01:33:53,018
Wins.

715
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:15,300
Deal me out.

716
01:34:16,309 --> 01:34:19,437
Sorry, sir. You are the big blind.

717
01:34:21,414 --> 01:34:22,972
Small blind, please.

718
01:35:27,079 --> 01:35:29,479
- Who is it?
- It's 007.

719
01:35:31,150 --> 01:35:33,710
Bond's been poisoned.
He's going into cardiac arrest.

720
01:35:35,888 --> 01:35:38,322
Stay calm and don't interrupt.
Because you'll be dead...

721
01:35:38,524 --> 01:35:41,152
...within two minutes
unless you do exactly what I tell you.

722
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:42,620
I'm all ears.

723
01:35:42,828 --> 01:35:44,352
Remove the defibrillator
from the pouch.

724
01:35:44,563 --> 01:35:46,895
- Do we know what it is yet?
- <i>We're still scanning.</i>

725
01:35:52,538 --> 01:35:55,268
Attach the leads to your chest.

726
01:36:03,916 --> 01:36:05,884
Ventricular tachycardia. Digitalis.

727
01:36:06,185 --> 01:36:08,983
What do we give him? The kit
has amphetamines, antihistamines...

728
01:36:09,188 --> 01:36:10,815
<i>... hydrocortisone. Adrenalin?</i>

729
01:36:11,023 --> 01:36:13,753
- <i>As soon as it reads charged</i>...
- <i>Lidocaine. That'll work.</i>

730
01:36:13,959 --> 01:36:16,427
Bond, don't push the red button yet.
Do you hear me? Don't push it.

731
01:36:16,629 --> 01:36:18,062
His heart's gonna stop.

732
01:36:18,264 --> 01:36:20,630
<i>There's only time for one charge</i>
<i>before he passes out.</i>

733
01:36:21,634 --> 01:36:25,502
Take the blue combipen, Bond.
Mid-neck into the vein.

734
01:36:25,704 --> 01:36:28,002
<i>That'll counteract the digitalis.</i>

735
01:36:31,310 --> 01:36:33,107
You're going to pass out
in a few seconds.

736
01:36:33,312 --> 01:36:34,745
You need to keep
your heart going.

737
01:36:34,947 --> 01:36:36,175
Push the red button now, Bond.

738
01:36:42,288 --> 01:36:44,722
- Bond, push the damn button!
- Do it now!

739
01:37:32,605 --> 01:37:34,573
- You okay?
- Me?

740
01:37:37,910 --> 01:37:40,504
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

741
01:37:40,713 --> 01:37:44,376
- Now get yourself off to a hospital.
- I will do.

742
01:37:45,384 --> 01:37:46,783
As soon as I've won this game.

743
01:37:46,986 --> 01:37:49,716
You're not seriously
going back there?

744
01:37:52,291 --> 01:37:54,191
I wouldn't dream of it.

745
01:37:55,828 --> 01:37:57,420
Bet. One million.

746
01:38:01,167 --> 01:38:02,725
- All in.
- Call. All in.

747
01:38:02,935 --> 01:38:05,529
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

748
01:38:07,540 --> 01:38:09,440
Two pair. Aces and sevens.

749
01:38:13,379 --> 01:38:15,813
Queen plays. Wins.

750
01:38:24,390 --> 01:38:25,584
Oh, I'm sorry.

751
01:38:25,791 --> 01:38:28,351
That last hand, it nearly killed me.

752
01:38:29,795 --> 01:38:33,390
Gentlemen, with this chip exchange,
we enter the final phase of the game...

753
01:38:33,599 --> 01:38:35,362
...which means no more buy-ins.

754
01:38:35,568 --> 01:38:38,765
The big blind is now
1 million dollars.

755
01:38:45,844 --> 01:38:46,970
Four players.

756
01:38:49,782 --> 01:38:51,147
It's your bet.

757
01:38:55,187 --> 01:38:56,347
- Monsieur Bond?
- Check.

758
01:38:56,555 --> 01:39:00,389
- Check.
- Twenty-four million in the pot already.

759
01:39:03,262 --> 01:39:05,389
Check. And check.

760
01:39:05,831 --> 01:39:07,423
All check.

761
01:39:07,766 --> 01:39:08,960
Four players.

762
01:39:13,973 --> 01:39:15,372
- Check.
- Check.

763
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:23,441
All in. Six million.

764
01:39:24,350 --> 01:39:26,875
Bet. Six million. All in.

765
01:39:32,324 --> 01:39:34,656
Five million. All in.

766
01:39:34,860 --> 01:39:37,420
Bet is 6 million.

767
01:39:44,937 --> 01:39:46,268
Raise.

768
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:49,034
Raise.

769
01:39:49,241 --> 01:39:52,506
Twelve million. Heads up.

770
01:40:23,108 --> 01:40:26,236
Forty million, 500,000. All in.

771
01:40:28,681 --> 01:40:30,512
Raise. All in.

772
01:40:49,401 --> 01:40:52,996
Well, I think I will call you
on that one.

773
01:40:59,845 --> 01:41:01,039
Call.

774
01:41:12,925 --> 01:41:17,123
One hundred and fifteen million
in the pot.

775
01:41:17,329 --> 01:41:20,059
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

776
01:41:23,702 --> 01:41:25,636
Flush. Ace, king, queen.

777
01:41:34,213 --> 01:41:37,205
Full house. Eights full of aces.

778
01:41:55,367 --> 01:41:57,494
A higher full house.

779
01:41:57,703 --> 01:41:59,170
Aces full of sixes.

780
01:42:05,177 --> 01:42:06,371
Monsieur Bond.

781
01:42:23,429 --> 01:42:25,920
Five and seven of spades.

782
01:42:26,131 --> 01:42:27,598
A straight flush.

783
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:29,097
Four to the eight.

784
01:42:29,301 --> 01:42:31,394
The high hand.

785
01:42:36,108 --> 01:42:37,632
Monsieur Bond wins.

786
01:42:38,644 --> 01:42:40,942
- For you.
- Thank you very much.

787
01:42:43,382 --> 01:42:44,576
Congratulations.

788
01:42:44,783 --> 01:42:48,310
- He's all yours.
- Much appreciated, brother.

789
01:42:55,294 --> 01:42:56,454
Congratulations.

790
01:42:56,662 --> 01:42:58,527
You know,
I think a celebration's in order.

791
01:42:58,730 --> 01:43:01,255
You were almost dead an hour ago.

792
01:43:02,134 --> 01:43:05,126
Come on, I'm famished.

793
01:43:15,547 --> 01:43:17,412
Thank you.

794
01:43:25,023 --> 01:43:28,925
Mathis says the Americans
have made contact with Le Chiffre.

795
01:43:29,127 --> 01:43:31,755
They're going to extract him
before dawn.

796
01:43:32,464 --> 01:43:34,432
You know, I think
I'll call that a Vesper.

797
01:43:35,834 --> 01:43:37,631
Because of the bitter aftertaste?

798
01:43:37,836 --> 01:43:42,000
No. Because once you've tasted it,
that's all you want to drink.

799
01:43:44,610 --> 01:43:47,704
- I thought that was quite a good line.
- It was a very good line.

800
01:43:48,947 --> 01:43:50,437
But you're laughing at it.

801
01:43:50,782 --> 01:43:55,048
- Not so much it as you.
- Well, that's fine then.

802
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:02,918
I figured out what that is.

803
01:44:05,364 --> 01:44:07,628
It's an Algerian love knot.

804
01:44:07,833 --> 01:44:11,030
Really? I thought it was
just something pretty.

805
01:44:11,236 --> 01:44:12,863
No, you didn't.

806
01:44:13,772 --> 01:44:15,239
Someone gave that to you.

807
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:20,673
He's a very lucky man.

808
01:44:27,185 --> 01:44:30,018
You can switch off so easily,
can't you?

809
01:44:30,389 --> 01:44:32,584
It doesn't bother you,
killing those people?

810
01:44:33,191 --> 01:44:36,217
Well, I wouldn't be very good
at my job if it did.

811
01:44:37,162 --> 01:44:39,392
I don't believe you.

812
01:44:40,032 --> 01:44:42,193
You've got a choice, you know?

813
01:44:42,401 --> 01:44:43,993
Just because
you've done something...

814
01:44:44,202 --> 01:44:46,329
...doesn't mean
you have to keep doing it.

815
01:44:46,538 --> 01:44:49,439
Why is it people who can't take advice
always insist on giving it?

816
01:44:49,641 --> 01:44:51,609
You think I can't take
my own advice?

817
01:44:52,511 --> 01:44:55,173
I think something is driving you.

818
01:44:55,714 --> 01:44:57,739
And I think I'll never find out
what that is.

819
01:45:03,689 --> 01:45:05,816
Mathis needs me.

820
01:45:06,491 --> 01:45:07,753
Good night.

821
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:09,291
Congratulations again.

822
01:45:28,580 --> 01:45:30,411
Mathis.

823
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:26,296
I'm afraid your friend Mathis
is really...

824
01:47:27,566 --> 01:47:29,363
...my friend Mathis.

825
01:49:12,137 --> 01:49:14,867
You've taken good care
of your body.

826
01:49:21,413 --> 01:49:23,904
Such a waste.

827
01:49:41,166 --> 01:49:42,997
You know...

828
01:49:43,368 --> 01:49:46,496
...I never understood
all these elaborate tortures.

829
01:49:46,705 --> 01:49:48,900
It's the simplest thing...

830
01:49:49,107 --> 01:49:52,634
...to cause more pain
than a man can possibly endure.

831
01:49:54,145 --> 01:49:55,305
And of course...

832
01:49:55,513 --> 01:49:58,482
...it's not only the immediate agony,
but the knowledge...

833
01:49:58,683 --> 01:50:01,345
...that if you do not yield
soon enough...

834
01:50:02,053 --> 01:50:05,682
...there will be little left
to identify you as a man.

835
01:50:11,763 --> 01:50:13,663
The only question remains...

836
01:50:15,166 --> 01:50:17,327
...will you yield in time?

837
01:50:19,404 --> 01:50:22,532
I want the money.

838
01:50:41,259 --> 01:50:44,695
Miss Lynd will give me the account
number, if she hasn't already.

839
01:50:44,896 --> 01:50:47,262
So all I need from you
is the password.

840
01:50:57,042 --> 01:51:00,273
The password, please.

841
01:51:04,516 --> 01:51:06,814
I've got a little itch...

842
01:51:07,018 --> 01:51:08,883
...down there.

843
01:51:09,654 --> 01:51:11,121
Would you mind?

844
01:51:18,863 --> 01:51:22,264
No! No! No!

845
01:51:23,234 --> 01:51:26,931
No. To the right.
To the right. To the right!

846
01:51:27,138 --> 01:51:29,572
You are a funny man, Mr. Bond.

847
01:51:31,509 --> 01:51:32,999
Yeah!

848
01:51:34,245 --> 01:51:37,544
Yes, yes, yes.

849
01:51:43,221 --> 01:51:48,659
Now the whole world's gonna know
that you died scratching my balls.

850
01:51:49,961 --> 01:51:51,952
I died?

851
01:51:52,163 --> 01:51:53,460
- I died?
- Yes.

852
01:51:53,665 --> 01:51:56,634
Because no matter what you do,
I'm not gonna give you the password.

853
01:51:56,835 --> 01:51:58,666
Which means your clients
will hunt you down...

854
01:51:58,870 --> 01:52:01,703
...and cut you into pieces of meat
while you're still breathing.

855
01:52:01,906 --> 01:52:03,305
Because if you kill me...

856
01:52:03,508 --> 01:52:05,567
...there'll be nowhere else to hide.

857
01:52:05,777 --> 01:52:08,575
But you are so wrong!

858
01:52:08,780 --> 01:52:11,772
Because even after I slaughtered
you and your little girlfriend...

859
01:52:11,983 --> 01:52:14,781
...your people would still welcome me
with open arms...

860
01:52:16,321 --> 01:52:19,950
...because they need what I know.

861
01:52:21,192 --> 01:52:23,251
The big picture.

862
01:52:31,169 --> 01:52:33,399
Give me the password...

863
01:52:33,605 --> 01:52:35,539
...and I will at least let her live.

864
01:52:39,210 --> 01:52:42,304
Bond. Do it soon enough
and she might even be in one piece.

865
01:52:55,393 --> 01:52:57,520
You really aren't going to tell me,
are you?

866
01:52:57,729 --> 01:52:59,526
No.

867
01:53:01,366 --> 01:53:03,266
So I think...

868
01:53:07,806 --> 01:53:11,242
...I'll feed you
what you seem not to value.

869
01:53:24,389 --> 01:53:26,653
I'll get the money.

870
01:53:27,559 --> 01:53:30,050
Tell them I'll get the money.

871
01:53:30,261 --> 01:53:34,721
Money isn't as valuable to our
organization as knowing who to trust.

872
01:53:58,356 --> 01:53:59,755
Francesco.

873
01:54:00,692 --> 01:54:02,592
Francesco.

874
01:54:15,306 --> 01:54:17,433
Vesper.

875
01:54:19,310 --> 01:54:21,210
Vesper.

876
01:54:23,348 --> 01:54:24,872
No.

877
01:54:25,683 --> 01:54:27,014
Not him.

878
01:54:27,218 --> 01:54:29,118
Not Mathis.

879
01:54:30,955 --> 01:54:32,115
No.

880
01:54:32,957 --> 01:54:34,982
I'll get the doctor.

881
01:54:37,762 --> 01:54:39,559
Not him.

882
01:54:41,466 --> 01:54:42,626
Any ideas?

883
01:54:46,371 --> 01:54:50,205
- What?
- Why they left the two of you alive.

884
01:54:52,210 --> 01:54:53,643
Where is she?

885
01:54:54,679 --> 01:54:56,579
Sleeping.

886
01:54:57,182 --> 01:55:00,447
Well, I'm supposed
to get you to drink this.

887
01:55:01,553 --> 01:55:03,214
It's just odd...

888
01:55:03,421 --> 01:55:07,323
...killing everyone else
but leaving you and her untouched.

889
01:55:07,525 --> 01:55:10,858
Almost as if someone
was trying to tell us something.

890
01:55:12,030 --> 01:55:14,157
Get a look at the killer?

891
01:55:14,699 --> 01:55:16,428
No.

892
01:55:17,902 --> 01:55:19,335
Shame.

893
01:55:21,005 --> 01:55:22,734
Drink up.

894
01:55:26,144 --> 01:55:28,305
Anything else you remember?

895
01:55:28,513 --> 01:55:30,538
Anything that can help us?

896
01:55:30,748 --> 01:55:32,375
Help us?

897
01:55:32,584 --> 01:55:34,814
Or help you?

898
01:56:15,193 --> 01:56:16,353
Hello.

899
01:56:16,561 --> 01:56:18,392
Hello.

900
01:56:20,098 --> 01:56:21,395
You all right?

901
01:56:22,033 --> 01:56:24,194
I can't resist waking you.

902
01:56:24,402 --> 01:56:29,032
Every time I do, you look at me as if
you haven't seen me in years.

903
01:56:30,174 --> 01:56:32,165
It makes me feel reborn.

904
01:56:35,913 --> 01:56:39,007
If you'd just been born...

905
01:56:39,684 --> 01:56:41,948
...wouldn't you be naked?

906
01:56:42,720 --> 01:56:44,915
You have me there.

907
01:56:47,592 --> 01:56:50,288
You can have me anywhere.

908
01:56:52,363 --> 01:56:53,887
I can?

909
01:56:54,098 --> 01:56:57,966
Yeah. Here, there,
anywhere you like.

910
01:56:58,970 --> 01:57:01,871
Does this mean
that you're warming to me?

911
01:57:02,073 --> 01:57:04,268
Yeah. That's how I would describe it.

912
01:57:04,475 --> 01:57:05,908
It's just that not so long ago...

913
01:57:06,110 --> 01:57:09,978
...I would have described
your feelings towards me as...

914
01:57:11,449 --> 01:57:14,077
I'm trying to think
of a better word than "loathing."

915
01:57:14,652 --> 01:57:17,553
I'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.

916
01:57:18,089 --> 01:57:20,580
That is something to be afraid of.

917
01:57:23,361 --> 01:57:26,990
- Hello.
- Oh, perfect timing.

918
01:57:28,433 --> 01:57:31,163
Monsieur Mendel.
How are things in Switzerland?

919
01:57:31,369 --> 01:57:33,360
My apologies,
I do not mean to rush...

920
01:57:33,571 --> 01:57:35,562
...but 120 million
is a large sum of money.

921
01:57:35,773 --> 01:57:38,606
It certainly is. You didn't bring
any chocolates with you?

922
01:57:38,810 --> 01:57:40,937
I'm afraid not.

923
01:57:42,146 --> 01:57:45,013
If you would type in
the account number.

924
01:57:52,090 --> 01:57:53,489
And now the password.

925
01:57:54,292 --> 01:57:55,452
You can do that.

926
01:57:56,160 --> 01:57:58,219
I would if I knew what it was.

927
01:57:58,830 --> 01:58:05,201
V-E-S-P-E-R.

928
01:58:16,047 --> 01:58:17,844
The funds have been transferred.

929
01:58:18,049 --> 01:58:20,916
Sorry for disturbing you.

930
01:58:22,754 --> 01:58:25,985
- Auf Wiedersehen.
- Auf Wiedersehen, Herr Mendel.

931
01:58:32,563 --> 01:58:33,962
You know, James...

932
01:58:36,567 --> 01:58:39,468
...I just want you to know
that if all that was left of you...

933
01:58:39,670 --> 01:58:42,969
...was your smile
and your little finger...

934
01:58:43,174 --> 01:58:45,904
...you'd still be more of a man
than anyone I've ever met.

935
01:58:55,319 --> 01:58:58,982
That's because you know
what I can do with my little finger.

936
01:59:01,859 --> 01:59:05,727
- I have no idea.
- But you're aching to find out.

937
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:12,936
You're not going to let me
in there, are you?

938
01:59:13,671 --> 01:59:15,798
You've got your armor back on.

939
01:59:16,007 --> 01:59:17,235
That's that.

940
01:59:18,743 --> 01:59:21,303
I have no armor left.

941
01:59:22,547 --> 01:59:25,038
You've stripped it from me.

942
01:59:25,917 --> 01:59:28,385
Whatever is left of me...

943
01:59:28,853 --> 01:59:31,720
Whatever is left of me...

944
01:59:32,557 --> 01:59:34,525
...whatever I am...

945
01:59:34,725 --> 01:59:37,216
...I'm yours.

946
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:41,648
I suppose M won't miss me
for a couple of days.

947
02:00:42,393 --> 02:00:44,224
She'll be too busy sweating Mathis.

948
02:00:44,428 --> 02:00:45,622
Mathis?

949
02:00:45,830 --> 02:00:47,855
Remember I told you
about Le Chiffre's tell?

950
02:00:48,065 --> 02:00:50,499
Well, Mathis told Le Chiffre.

951
02:00:51,068 --> 02:00:52,626
That's how he wiped me out.

952
02:00:52,837 --> 02:00:56,500
Same goes for the implant. Can't say
I'm too sorry about losing that.

953
02:00:56,707 --> 02:00:58,902
I can't believe it.

954
02:00:59,110 --> 02:01:00,702
No, neither could I.

955
02:01:01,178 --> 02:01:03,578
I thought he had my back.

956
02:01:04,248 --> 02:01:06,045
But there you go, lesson learned.

957
02:01:07,451 --> 02:01:09,851
Does everyone have a tell?

958
02:01:11,789 --> 02:01:13,518
Yes.

959
02:01:16,460 --> 02:01:18,223
Everyone.

960
02:01:18,629 --> 02:01:20,460
Everyone except you.

961
02:01:24,936 --> 02:01:26,961
I wonder if that's why I love you.

962
02:01:29,006 --> 02:01:30,940
You love me?

963
02:01:31,475 --> 02:01:33,739
Enough to quit
and float round the world with you...

964
02:01:33,945 --> 02:01:36,140
...until one of us
has to find an honest job.

965
02:01:36,781 --> 02:01:40,842
But I think that's gonna have to be you.
I've no idea what an honest job is.

966
02:01:41,752 --> 02:01:43,185
You're serious.

967
02:01:44,155 --> 02:01:46,055
Like you said...

968
02:01:46,624 --> 02:01:48,319
...you do what I do for too long...

969
02:01:48,526 --> 02:01:51,324
...and there won't be any soul
left to salvage.

970
02:01:51,529 --> 02:01:54,396
I'm leaving with
what little I have left.

971
02:01:56,400 --> 02:01:58,493
Is that enough for you?

972
02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:44,740
- Come on.
- No. No.

973
02:03:45,242 --> 02:03:48,439
No, stop it. Stop.
I have to get to the bank.

974
02:03:48,646 --> 02:03:50,841
What's the time?

975
02:03:53,084 --> 02:03:55,143
How much do we need
to float for a month?

976
02:03:55,619 --> 02:03:57,382
I've got plenty.

977
02:03:57,588 --> 02:04:01,524
No, I want to pay for my half
of our aimless wanderings.

978
02:04:04,462 --> 02:04:06,794
You stopped wearing the necklace.

979
02:04:06,997 --> 02:04:10,160
Yeah. It was time.

980
02:04:10,367 --> 02:04:13,097
Time enough to get over someone?

981
02:04:17,875 --> 02:04:21,242
To realize sometimes
you can forget the past.

982
02:04:29,954 --> 02:04:31,854
Though apparently not
your employer.

983
02:04:36,293 --> 02:04:39,524
Back in one month.

984
02:04:40,598 --> 02:04:42,998
Come on. I'll get the money...

985
02:04:43,200 --> 02:04:45,361
...you get supplies.

986
02:05:15,032 --> 02:05:17,466
I'll see you back here
in half an hour.

987
02:05:41,959 --> 02:05:44,393
- Hello, M.
- I got your note.

988
02:05:44,595 --> 02:05:46,256
<i>Yes?</i>

989
02:05:46,463 --> 02:05:48,294
We'll talk about that later.

990
02:05:48,499 --> 02:05:51,491
Right now I have a lovely man
from the Treasury here...

991
02:05:51,702 --> 02:05:54,262
...wondering if you're ever
going to deposit the winnings.

992
02:05:57,975 --> 02:06:00,808
That's a shame.
I didn't think they'd miss it.

993
02:06:01,011 --> 02:06:04,310
<i>Yes. Well, I told them not to worry.</i>

994
02:06:04,515 --> 02:06:06,676
So you'll be depositing it today.

995
02:06:07,017 --> 02:06:09,645
On my way to the bank right now.

996
02:06:10,054 --> 02:06:12,750
James Bond for Mr. Mendel.

997
02:06:13,224 --> 02:06:14,384
<i>Hello.</i>

998
02:06:14,592 --> 02:06:17,993
Mr. Mendel? I'm having trouble
accessing the funds in my account.

999
02:06:18,195 --> 02:06:20,026
It was transferred
to the account number...

1000
02:06:20,231 --> 02:06:22,529
...your company gave us, Mr. Bond.

1001
02:06:25,169 --> 02:06:28,570
It appears the funds
are being withdrawn as we speak.

1002
02:06:31,275 --> 02:06:33,106
- Where?
- The Venice branch, of course.

1003
02:06:33,310 --> 02:06:34,538
St. Mark's Square.

1004
02:06:36,914 --> 02:06:38,609
<i>Is there a problem, Mr. Bond?</i>

1005
02:08:51,315 --> 02:08:52,475
I'll kill her!

1006
02:08:53,484 --> 02:08:54,678
Allow me.

1007
02:13:14,611 --> 02:13:16,579
I'm sorry, James.

1008
02:16:28,238 --> 02:16:30,968
<i>She had a boyfriend.</i>
<i>A French Algerian.</i>

1009
02:16:31,174 --> 02:16:33,233
<i>They were very much in love.</i>

1010
02:16:33,643 --> 02:16:36,771
<i>He was kidnapped</i>
<i>by the organization behind Le Chiffre.</i>

1011
02:16:36,980 --> 02:16:41,940
And they blackmailed her, threatening
to kill him unless she cooperated.

1012
02:16:42,152 --> 02:16:43,517
We should've picked up on it...

1013
02:16:43,720 --> 02:16:45,950
...but sometimes
we're so focused on our enemies...

1014
02:16:46,156 --> 02:16:47,680
...we forget to watch our friends.

1015
02:16:49,326 --> 02:16:51,191
<i>How are you doing?</i>

1016
02:16:51,528 --> 02:16:53,758
She left her cell phone.

1017
02:16:53,964 --> 02:16:56,330
She must have known I'd check it.

1018
02:16:57,133 --> 02:16:59,294
She knew you were you.

1019
02:17:00,370 --> 02:17:02,600
- Well, at least this clears Mathis.
- <i>No.</i>

1020
02:17:02,806 --> 02:17:04,433
- No?
- No.

1021
02:17:04,641 --> 02:17:07,132
We just proved that she's guilty,
not that he's innocent.

1022
02:17:07,344 --> 02:17:09,676
It could've been a double blind.
Keep sweating him.

1023
02:17:10,480 --> 02:17:12,243
You don't trust anyone,
do you, James?

1024
02:17:12,449 --> 02:17:14,076
<i>No.</i>

1025
02:17:14,584 --> 02:17:16,848
Then you've learnt your lesson.

1026
02:17:17,654 --> 02:17:19,849
Get back as soon as you can.
We need you.

1027
02:17:20,590 --> 02:17:21,750
Will do.

1028
02:17:24,027 --> 02:17:25,392
If you do need time...

1029
02:17:25,595 --> 02:17:26,857
<i>Why should I need more time?</i>

1030
02:17:27,998 --> 02:17:31,263
The job's done,
and the bitch is dead.

1031
02:17:32,202 --> 02:17:33,999
James...

1032
02:17:34,638 --> 02:17:38,039
...did you ever ask yourself
why you weren't killed that night?

1033
02:17:38,642 --> 02:17:40,337
<i>Isn't it obvious?</i>

1034
02:17:40,544 --> 02:17:44,503
<i>She made a deal to spare your life</i>
<i>in exchange for the money.</i>

1035
02:17:44,714 --> 02:17:46,875
<i>I'm sure she hoped</i>
<i>they would let her live.</i>

1036
02:17:48,451 --> 02:17:51,443
But she must have known
she was going to her death.

1037
02:17:52,556 --> 02:17:55,491
<i>And now we'll never know</i>
<i>who was behind this.</i>

1038
02:17:55,692 --> 02:17:58,252
<i>The trail's gone cold.</i>

1039
02:19:25,782 --> 02:19:27,682
- Hello.
- <i>Mr. White?</i>

1040
02:19:27,884 --> 02:19:29,374
<i>We need to talk.</i>

1041
02:19:29,586 --> 02:19:31,451
Who is this?

1042
02:20:01,751 --> 02:20:03,742
The name's Bond.

1043
02:20:03,953 --> 02:20:05,887
James Bond.

1044
02:20:06,305 --> 02:20:12,381
