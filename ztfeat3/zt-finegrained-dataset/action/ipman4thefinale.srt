[doctor] Mr. Ip.

15
00:01:57,642 --> 00:01:59,842
Your x-ray result shows
that your tumor is malignant.

16
00:02:02,642 --> 00:02:04,473
Even though it is still
at an early stage,

17
00:02:04,475 --> 00:02:06,340
the cancer cells
are spreading rapidly

18
00:02:06,342 --> 00:02:09,674
for it to be controlled
by standard medication.

19
00:02:09,676 --> 00:02:11,409
Nowadays, hospitals
offer chemotherapy.

20
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:14,807
It can control cancer cells.

21
00:02:14,809 --> 00:02:16,075
You should think about it.

22
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:19,776
First, you must quit smoking.

23
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:22,409
Don't smoke anymore.

I'm just tryin' to share

No.

- [instructor] Leave.

42
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:38,840
- It's fine.
- Just listen to me.

- I don't understand you.

- Just listen to me!

- What's wrong with you?
- Are you nuts?

Do you want me to beat you up?

47
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:46,340
- Get lost!
- Don't push me.

48

- I said get lost!
- I said don't push me!

Here to challenge us?

[all gasping in surprise]

I'm a student of Bruce Lee.

My name's Billy.

65

I have something for you.

66
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,140
Sifu wants you to come to the
Karate tournament in the US

which takes place next month.

Here, this is a plane ticket
for you he prepared.

69
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,907
And this book, he wrote it.

70
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,208
He wants you to have it.

71
00:04:39,943 --> 00:04:41,409
- Bruce.
- Bruce?

72
00:04:42,043 --> 00:04:43,173
Bruce Lee?

73
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:44,240
He is good?

74
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,373
He's doin' fine.

75
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,740
He has a Kung Fu school
in Seattle.

76
00:04:46,742 --> 00:04:49,142
And I'm from his newly
opened one in San Francisco.

77
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:54,108
Billy.

78
00:04:55,776 --> 00:04:57,142
Tell Bruce...

79
00:04:58,275 --> 00:04:59,776
maybe I have no time.

80
00:05:00,776 --> 00:05:03,108
- Thank you.
- Oh.

81
00:05:05,342 --> 00:05:07,142

Thank you.

00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:34,173
What is it?

87
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:35,709

Mr. Ip.

94
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:55,275
This is Ip Ching's
expulsion letter.

95
00:05:57,442 --> 00:06:00,342
We can't keep him
in our school anymore.

96
00:06:01,576 --> 00:06:03,041
Headmaster.

97
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:05,307
Can you give Ip Ching
one more chance?

98
00:06:05,309 --> 00:06:08,007
I promise he will behave.

99
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:09,774
Please give him another chance.

100
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:11,540
Let him stay.

101
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:13,707
It's not his first time
getting into a fight.

102
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:16,874
[principal] Last time
was already his last chance.

103
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,640
Since he is so sportive,

104
00:06:18,642 --> 00:06:21,375
it may be better for him
to study abroad.

105
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:31,106
It's not serious.
They're just minor cuts.

106
00:06:31,108 --> 00:06:32,542
But be careful next time.

107
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,007
Thank you, doctor.

108
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:36,776
The nurse will patch you up.

109
00:06:38,842 --> 00:06:40,106
Where is your family?

110
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,309
Doctor.

111
00:06:42,275 --> 00:06:44,041
Master Ip.

[Ming] It has been a while.

113
00:06:45,776 --> 00:06:48,273
I am Ming, Ms Luk's son.

114
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:50,907
Your kung fu studio used to be
on our rooftop.

115
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:52,073
- Oh.
- [laughs]

116
00:06:52,075 --> 00:06:53,707
My mom sent me
to study in America

117
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:55,707
since I was too naughty.

118
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:56,574
[Ming] I just came back.

119
00:06:56,576 --> 00:06:58,740
I work in this hospital now.

120
00:06:58,742 --> 00:07:01,707
It's really something
to be abroad on your own.

121
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:03,106
[Ming] Not really.

122
00:07:03,108 --> 00:07:04,173
Master Ip.

123
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:06,574
Ching is fine, don't worry.

124
00:07:06,576 --> 00:07:08,309
- See you later.
- Thank you.

Answer the door, Ching.

[buzzing continues]

131
00:07:58,442 --> 00:08:01,375
- Master Ip.
- Hi, Bob. Please come in.

132
00:08:02,642 --> 00:08:04,106
What's the matter?

133
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,473
America is so far away.

134
00:08:05,475 --> 00:08:07,574
Why are you leaving so suddenly?

135
00:08:07,576 --> 00:08:11,407
I am going to San Francisco
to look for a school for Ching.

136
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:14,774
Good idea. Mr. Ba also sent
his son there recently.

137
00:08:14,776 --> 00:08:15,840
One can earn much more

138
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:17,041
after studying overseas..

139
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:19,240
- [Ip] Please take a seat.
- Okay.

140
00:08:19,242 --> 00:08:21,642
- [Ip] Have some tea.
- Don't bother.

141
00:08:23,542 --> 00:08:24,475
Ching.

142
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,774
- Greet your elder.
- He did, he nodded.

143
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:31,142
- [Ip] Have some tea.
- [Bob] Thank you.

144
00:08:32,676 --> 00:08:34,774
- Bob.
- Yes?

145
00:08:34,776 --> 00:08:39,206
Can you please come to check
on Ching while I'm away?

146
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,941
Not a problem.

147
00:08:40,943 --> 00:08:42,106
While I'm in America,

148
00:08:42,108 --> 00:08:45,707
I will phone home at 10:00 p.m.
Hong Kong time every day.

149
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:46,707
Okay.

150
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:48,609
[Ching] You don't have to call.
I won't answer it.

151
00:08:50,842 --> 00:08:51,740
Don't worry.

152
00:08:51,742 --> 00:08:54,307
I will be here on time
to make him answer the call.

153
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:56,507
Right, don't be too soft
on your son.

154
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:59,840
- You're spoiling him.
- No, I have to.

155
00:08:59,842 --> 00:09:01,140
I want to send him abroad

156
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:03,473
so that he'll have
a chance to experience

157
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:06,340
- how it is to be independent.
- That's right.

158
00:09:06,342 --> 00:09:08,073
[Ching] I won't go.

159
00:09:08,075 --> 00:09:09,542
If you want to go,
go by yourself.

160
00:09:11,075 --> 00:09:13,941
If you have something to say,
come here and say it, okay?

161
00:09:13,943 --> 00:09:15,242
- [Ching sighs]
- [paper rustles]

162
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,707
There's no way
I'm going to America.

163
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:20,140
You can't make me.

164
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,607
I have told you many times.

165
00:09:21,609 --> 00:09:23,607
I don't like studying at all.

00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:50,809
How about this?

329
00:16:52,108 --> 00:16:53,809
Drink this cup of tea...

330
00:16:54,976 --> 00:16:56,607
and you are one of us.

331
00:16:56,609 --> 00:16:59,442
I'll write the letter for you.

[Ip] Fellow masters.

00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:21,206
Mr. Wan.

335
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,240
You might have
misunderstood Bruce.

336
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,941
In fact, Bruce just wants
Chinese martial arts

337
00:17:26,943 --> 00:17:28,440
to have a wider following.

338
00:17:28,442 --> 00:17:29,742
I think it's a wonderful thing.

Do you two have what it takes

343
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:44,242
to be the exemplars
of Chinese martial arts?

Excuse me.

I am sorry about what happened.

- I didn't expect that.
- It's not your fault.

- Gun.
- Hmm?

364
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:03,640
Is the recommendation letter
essential

for meeting
the school principal?

Yes.

00:19:07,342 --> 00:19:09,507
After all, we are immigrants.

368
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:13,273
Schools here only acknowledge
reputable people.

369

- A recommendation is a must.
- Mm-hm.

Don't worry.

371
00:19:16,442 --> 00:19:17,674
I have some American friends.

372
00:19:17,676 --> 00:19:19,041
I'll ask them
to write the letter.

373

- [Ip] Okay.
- I won't keep you.

Get some rest.

- [Ip] Let me walk you out.
- Sure.

I can hear you, Bob.
Loud and clear.

Really?

How are things over there?

388
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,073
I heard the air
is fresher there.

389
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:11,240
It's a huge country.

390
00:20:11,242 --> 00:20:13,175
It's so vast that you can't
even see the buildings across you.

391
00:20:15,842 --> 00:20:16,742
Not exactly.

392
00:20:17,742 --> 00:20:20,206
Right. Is Ching there?

393
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,106
Can you put him on the phone?

394
00:20:22,108 --> 00:20:24,108
Ching. Come take the call.

395
00:20:28,943 --> 00:20:30,807
[Bob] Hurry up.

396
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:32,576
Long-distance calls cost a lot.

397
00:20:36,108 --> 00:20:38,407
He won't answer.

398
00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:39,507
That's how they are.

Defiance is the trademark
of youth.

400

are some meds</i>

that are only sold in the US
and not in Hong Kong.

403
00:20:48,742 --> 00:20:50,941
Can you help me
get some just in case?

404
00:20:50,943 --> 00:20:52,041
No problem.

405
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,974
Please write them down.

Why are you late again?

412
00:21:12,242 --> 00:21:13,574
I am exhausted today.

413
00:21:13,576 --> 00:21:15,273
I just finished
all the assignments.

414
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,440
I took a nap before I came.

You're not exhausted
when practicing cheerleading,

00:21:20,342 --> 00:21:22,740
but you are when it comes
to martial arts, huh?

418
00:21:22,742 --> 00:21:24,642
You don't get tired
of doing what you like.

- Nothing.

Look at yourself.

How can you join
the Mid-Autumn Festival?

431
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,175
How can you go on stage?

432
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:08,108
God, this is so tedious.

How many times have I told you?

434
00:22:13,509 --> 00:22:16,609
In here,
you have to speak Chinese.

[Gun] Hi, Mr. Wright.
How are you?

436
00:22:21,642 --> 00:22:23,507
I thought I was gonna be
speaking with your boss.

437
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:26,874
[Gun] Actually, it's not
my boss who send me.

438
00:22:26,876 --> 00:22:29,607
I have something perhaps
you can help me with.

439
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:31,275
[Wright] Okay, what
can I do for you?

440
00:22:32,342 --> 00:22:34,807
This is my friend, Ip Man.

441
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:36,173
How do you do?

442
00:22:36,175 --> 00:22:38,140
He is looking for a school
for his son

443
00:22:38,142 --> 00:22:39,874
to attend in America.

444
00:22:39,876 --> 00:22:42,307
So maybe you can help him

445
00:22:42,309 --> 00:22:44,774
by writing
a recommendation letter.

446
00:22:44,776 --> 00:22:46,642
Can I have a minute
with you, please?

447
00:22:50,676 --> 00:22:56,173
Mr. Leung, nowadays, many people
fancy comin' over here

448
00:22:56,175 --> 00:22:57,907
to try and find a better life.

449
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:00,407
Your luck is your ability.

450
00:23:00,409 --> 00:23:02,073
And you achieve
because you choose

451
00:23:02,075 --> 00:23:03,774
to work with a great boss.

452
00:23:03,776 --> 00:23:05,173
But your friend here...

453
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,007
He is a Chinese kung fu master.

454
00:23:07,009 --> 00:23:11,041
[Wright] Look, I don't really
know you that well.

455
00:23:11,043 --> 00:23:12,907
I certainly don't know him.

456
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:16,407
How do I know that he isn't
some kind of fugitive

457
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:18,340
just like all of the other
illegal aliens

458
00:23:18,342 --> 00:23:21,206
that get deported every day
from Chinatown?

459
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:22,674
[Gun] I think you're
being biased.

460
00:23:22,676 --> 00:23:25,674
Not all Chinese
are criminals, Mr. Wright.

461

Listen, sonny.

standing here on my property

00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:35,140
wasting my valuable time
is because of your boss.

464
00:23:35,142 --> 00:23:37,874
[Wright] I'm only doing this
for the sake of my friend.

to America.

493
00:25:42,075 --> 00:25:44,440
[exhales]
You are welcome.

494
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:49,576
Actually, I'm also here to try
to find a school for Ching.

495
00:25:50,876 --> 00:25:52,106
You know,

496
00:25:52,108 --> 00:25:54,540
a recommendation letter is
needed for school application.

497
00:25:54,542 --> 00:25:56,907
So, do you mean

498
00:25:56,909 --> 00:25:59,375
those folks from the association
refused to write you a letter?

499
00:26:01,342 --> 00:26:03,974
I have a student
who is a lawyer.

500
00:26:03,976 --> 00:26:05,674
He should be able to help.

501
00:26:05,676 --> 00:26:06,774
Don't worry.

502
00:26:06,776 --> 00:26:08,540
- Thank you.
- Mm.

503
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:09,607
- [Hartman] Master.
- Hey.

504
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,707
- [Billy] Master.
- Over here.

505
00:26:10,709 --> 00:26:12,507
- [student] Master.
- They're my students.

506
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:15,140
- Grandmaster, how you doing?
- Hartman, come and sit.

507
00:26:15,142 --> 00:26:16,373
Hey. Hello.

508
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:18,073
- Amazing.
- [Ip] Hello.

509
00:26:18,075 --> 00:26:19,507
- Master.
- Grandmaster.

510
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:22,206
This is Hartman.
He's one of a kind.

511
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:24,774
He's a Marine Staff Sergeant.

512
00:26:24,776 --> 00:26:26,574
He's very much
into Chinese martial arts.

513
00:26:26,576 --> 00:26:28,907
He always tells me he wants to
introduce Chinese martial arts

514
00:26:28,909 --> 00:26:30,106
to the Marines.

515
00:26:30,108 --> 00:26:34,273
In America, most people don't
know about Chinese martial arts.

516
00:26:34,275 --> 00:26:35,707
[Hartman] I have practiced
Wing Chun for a while.

517
00:26:35,709 --> 00:26:38,307
Its centerline theory
for both attack and defense

518
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:39,540
is useful for combat.

519
00:26:39,542 --> 00:26:41,507
I'd recommend it to my officer.

520
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:42,840
[Billy]
What do you think, Grandmaster?

521
00:26:42,842 --> 00:26:43,907
Great idea.

522
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:45,473
[laughing]

523
00:26:45,475 --> 00:26:47,840
- [laughs]
- Hey, yo, kung fu man!

524
00:26:47,842 --> 00:26:49,106
[karateka] I saw you
at the tournament tonight.

525
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,709
I think your stuff is bullshit.

526
00:26:51,642 --> 00:26:53,340
I don't buy it.

527
00:26:53,342 --> 00:26:54,941
[tense music]

528
00:26:54,943 --> 00:26:56,106
What's up, man?

529
00:26:56,108 --> 00:26:58,173
- You wanna try it?
- [Bruce] Hartman.

530
00:26:58,175 --> 00:26:59,807
Let's take it outside.

531
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:01,041
[scoffs]

532
00:27:01,043 --> 00:27:02,307
I'll kick your ass, man.

533
00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:03,542
I'll kick your ass too.

534
00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:06,776
- Let's take 'em out here.
- I'll take you outside.

535
00:27:07,576 --> 00:27:08,807
[Bruce] Master.

536
00:27:08,809 --> 00:27:10,642
This happens all the time.
I'll be right back.

537
00:27:28,876 --> 00:27:29,842
[yells]

00:27:31,142 --> 00:27:33,342

How do you do?

- Hi. How are you today?
- It's very good.

594
00:31:59,742 --> 00:32:02,842
I have a appointment
with the principal.

00:32:05,108 --> 00:32:07,073
- "Mr. Ip Man," right?
- Yes.

596
00:32:07,075 --> 00:32:09,273
Do you have all
the required documents?

You, sir. Fire away.

She's in a meeting.
So would you mind waiting?

Okay, the contest is over.
I have made my decision.

00:33:26,876 --> 00:33:28,740
Yonah, you will be
the new cheerleader

619
00:33:28,742 --> 00:33:31,574
for away games starting
this mid-semester.

- Well done.
- [cheering]

621
00:33:33,242 --> 00:33:35,206
She doesn't deserve it.

What?

623
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:39,674
[Becky] She changed the routine
all on her own.

624
00:33:39,676 --> 00:33:41,073
She cheated.

625
00:33:41,075 --> 00:33:43,874
- Ah...
- She should be disqualified.

626
00:33:43,876 --> 00:33:45,173
Okay, I don't remember saying

627
00:33:45,175 --> 00:33:47,206
that improvisation
wasn't allowed.

628
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:49,007
Since I haven't finalized
the routines,

anyone's input is welcomed.

630

Yonah's... her, her move
was amazing.

[coach] And so is she.

632
00:33:56,142 --> 00:33:57,740
We all have the same goals.

633
00:33:57,742 --> 00:34:00,707
Why don't we try
to work together?

634
00:34:00,709 --> 00:34:01,840

- No problem.
- I was stuck

in a very important meeting.

641
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,175
- No problem.
- Come, please.

[principal] This lawyer
who wrote the letter,

643
00:34:27,342 --> 00:34:29,041
is he your lawyer?

644
00:34:29,043 --> 00:34:31,173
Actually, he is my student.

645
00:34:31,175 --> 00:34:32,440
Student.

646
00:34:32,442 --> 00:34:34,807
So you're a teacher too?

647
00:34:34,809 --> 00:34:36,242
I am a teacher.

648
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,373
I teach Chinese kung fu.

649
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:40,742
Chinese martial art.

650
00:34:41,943 --> 00:34:43,774
Like a gymnast?

651
00:34:43,776 --> 00:34:45,440
Yes, something like that.

652
00:34:45,442 --> 00:34:48,674
Well, as you already know,

653
00:34:48,676 --> 00:34:52,507
this is an exclusive
private school.

654
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:56,840
I can accept this letter
as a referral.

655
00:34:56,842 --> 00:34:59,407
But you still need to get
a recommendation

00:34:59,409 --> 00:35:02,407
from the Chinese Benevolent
Association

657
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:07,242
as they act as guarantors
for late school payment.

00:35:08,175 --> 00:35:09,475
- However...
- I understand.

659
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:14,507
If you can donate $10,000
to our school,

660
00:35:14,509 --> 00:35:18,607
to be one of our sponsoring
board of directors,

661
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:21,173
we can waive
the recommendation letter

662
00:35:21,175 --> 00:35:22,842
and accept your son right away.

[Becky] You think you look
so great out there.

670
00:35:49,242 --> 00:35:51,507
You look like
a little yellow monkey.

671
00:35:51,509 --> 00:35:53,007
We're not gonna
follow your lead.

672
00:35:53,009 --> 00:35:57,307
In America, people like you
follow. They don't lead.

673
00:35:57,309 --> 00:35:59,206
What do you want?
Just leave me alone.

674
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:02,407
If you're not happy,
then go back to Asia,

675
00:36:02,409 --> 00:36:05,840
This has been our land
for generations.

676

What do you people want from us?

677
00:36:08,509 --> 00:36:11,373
Now I know why they call you
a stupid blonde.

678
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:13,340
America has always
had immigrants.

679
00:36:13,342 --> 00:36:15,874
[Yonah] The Indians
are the only real Americans.

680
00:36:15,876 --> 00:36:19,442
Your ancestors
stole their land, paleface.

681

You think you can beat me?

No! No more! No! I'm sorry.

Mr. Ip, Yonah.

[Yonah] Mr. Ip, can you
hold this for me?

Mm-hm.

Mr. Ip, please take a look
from behind.

Please help me cut it
if it's not neat.

You were slammed by the gate.

- I'm okay.
- Let me take a look.

[Yonah] Whoa!

00:39:50,108 --> 00:39:52,273
I am really fine.

733
00:39:52,275 --> 00:39:53,974
I have some herbal ointment
at home.

734
00:39:53,976 --> 00:39:55,774
It works like magic.

735
00:39:55,776 --> 00:39:58,073
About what happened
at school today,

736
00:39:58,075 --> 00:39:59,807
does it happen often?

737
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:01,106
It's not the first time.

738
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:02,409
But I am not afraid of them.

739
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,206
- Does your family know?
- Yes.

740
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:08,307
My dad always asks me
to put up with it.

741
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:09,707
He is very strict.

742
00:40:09,709 --> 00:40:12,373
Mr. Ip, why were you
in our school?

743
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:14,974
I was there to apply for my son.

744
00:40:14,976 --> 00:40:16,373
Then you must have met my dad.

745
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:18,442
He is the Chairman of the
Chinese Benevolent Association.

746
00:40:19,676 --> 00:40:21,440
I have met your dad.

747
00:40:21,442 --> 00:40:23,373
He must have given you
the letter, then.

748
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:26,273
Mr. Ip, when will your son come?

749
00:40:26,275 --> 00:40:28,073
He'll have a hard time
getting used to life here.

750
00:40:28,075 --> 00:40:29,175
I can help out.

751
00:40:30,542 --> 00:40:32,707
Actually, your dad didn't help
with the letter.

752
00:40:32,709 --> 00:40:35,273
How come?
You are not a foreigner.

753
00:40:35,275 --> 00:40:37,674
Does your dad have an opinion
against them?

754
00:40:37,676 --> 00:40:38,574
Yes.

755
00:40:38,576 --> 00:40:42,273
He always says that they
are very bad to the Chinese.

756
00:40:42,275 --> 00:40:44,240
They only discriminate
and bully us.

757
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:46,440
[Yonah]
It has always been like that

758
00:40:46,442 --> 00:40:47,874
since he came here
with Grandpa as a kid.

759
00:40:47,876 --> 00:40:50,740
The way the Chinese are treated
here has always been unfair.

760
00:40:50,742 --> 00:40:53,007
That's why he founded the
Chinese Benevolent Association

761
00:40:53,009 --> 00:40:54,542
to protect us Chinese.

762

Oh, my god!

00:41:07,442 --> 00:41:08,576
[Gabrielle] What happened?

767
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,674
This Chinese girl.

768
00:41:12,676 --> 00:41:14,842
[Gabrielle] I need you
to come home right now.

00:41:16,108 --> 00:41:17,709
Becky's been attacked.

I wish you weren't away
on this business trip.

This is my friend, Mr. Ip.

776
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:50,240
You always say Chinese people
should help each other out.

777
00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:52,309
So please write him
a recommendation letter.

778
00:42:03,108 --> 00:42:04,208
Come over here.

779
00:42:11,342 --> 00:42:12,576
Did you get into a fight again?

No.

You know how I hate liars.

783
00:42:21,275 --> 00:42:22,609
I will ask you one more time.

784
00:42:23,442 --> 00:42:24,542
Did you get into a fight?

785
00:42:25,742 --> 00:42:26,674
- No.
- [slaps]

786

- Hey!
- They were jealous of me!

787
00:42:29,043 --> 00:42:30,206
Because I was made leader,

788
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:32,240
they cut my hair
and had people beat me up.

789
00:42:32,242 --> 00:42:34,106
How can I put up with it?

790
00:42:34,108 --> 00:42:35,073
You want me to put up with it.

791
00:42:35,075 --> 00:42:37,073
Then what's the point
of practicing martial arts?

792
00:42:37,075 --> 00:42:39,907
- Shut your mouth!
- [Ip] Mr. Wan.

793
00:42:39,909 --> 00:42:41,473
Your daughter was bullied.

794
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:43,208
It's not wrong
to defend herself.

795
00:42:47,709 --> 00:42:49,407
Master Ip.

796
00:42:49,409 --> 00:42:50,542
[Wan] As I've told you before,

797
00:42:52,509 --> 00:42:55,742
you don't understand
since you don't live here.

798

Let me tell you.

799
00:42:59,609 --> 00:43:00,709
We live here.

800
00:43:02,275 --> 00:43:03,809
This is our home.

801
00:43:05,742 --> 00:43:09,340
Those people keep trying
to get rid of us.

802
00:43:09,342 --> 00:43:11,542
They even want
to get rid of Chinatown.

803
00:43:12,776 --> 00:43:14,373
Don't you understand?

804
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:15,974
Have you tried
to get out of Chinatown

805
00:43:15,976 --> 00:43:19,275
to communicate with them
directly, to fight for a change?

You can change too.

If you want your letter,
don't use my daughter.

Show me what you've got.

It looks like we'll have to wait
until the Mid-Autumn Festival

859
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:47,776
to decide who's the winner.

860
00:47:51,442 --> 00:47:54,842
Winning or losing,
does it really matter?

861
00:47:56,475 --> 00:47:59,206
Shouldn't we use
Chinese martial arts

862
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:01,742
to change the biases against us?

863
00:48:07,776 --> 00:48:10,208
I brought Yonah back
because I wanted to protect her.

864

I'm not here for the letter.

Where's Ching?

877
00:49:24,742 --> 00:49:27,240
He went out to buy
some late-night snacks.

878
00:49:27,242 --> 00:49:29,407
[Bob] Right, how are things

Mm...

There's a bit of a hiccup.

882
00:49:35,075 --> 00:49:37,440
It might take a few more days
before I can return.

883
00:49:37,442 --> 00:49:41,140
Back in a few days?
That's very good.

00:51:03,409 --> 00:51:06,473
Did I just hear you say
that you surrender?

Did I?

915
00:51:07,542 --> 00:51:09,941
You know what
our motto is, recruit!

916
00:51:09,943 --> 00:51:12,373
Trained to kill! Ready to die!

917
00:51:12,375 --> 00:51:14,907
Do you understand the meaning
of those words?

918
00:51:14,909 --> 00:51:18,273
- It's hurting me, sir!
- Oh, it's hurting you, is it?

919
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:20,640
Hurting you. You know,
this is the problem.

920
00:51:20,642 --> 00:51:23,507
You know there is a rumor
going around this base,

921
00:51:23,509 --> 00:51:25,307
people saying that I'm racist.

922
00:51:25,309 --> 00:51:26,874
I'm not racist.

923
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:29,707
See, I don't hate you
because you're colored.

924
00:51:29,709 --> 00:51:32,974
I hate you because
you're a cowardly colored!

- You, Jackson. You're next.

927
00:51:41,642 --> 00:51:45,640
Staff Sergeant Hartman,
do you mind explaining to me

928
00:51:45,642 --> 00:51:49,409
what exactly
this contraption is?

929
00:51:50,309 --> 00:51:51,774
It's a Wing Chun dummy.

930
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:55,041
A kung fu training aid, like
a punching bag, if you will,

931
00:51:55,043 --> 00:51:57,140
but for Chinese martial arts.

932
00:51:57,142 --> 00:51:58,941
- [chuckles]
- [hard thumping]

933
00:51:58,943 --> 00:52:00,874
Let me ask you something.

934
00:52:00,876 --> 00:52:03,473
Did you fall out of your crib
this morning

935
00:52:03,475 --> 00:52:04,941
and bang your little head?

936
00:52:04,943 --> 00:52:07,106
[Gunny] Where the hell
do you think you are?

937
00:52:07,108 --> 00:52:08,774
Does this look like a museum

938
00:52:08,776 --> 00:52:13,106
for preserving your ancient
Chinese heritage?

939
00:52:13,108 --> 00:52:16,073
Wing Chun is improvising
and adapting,

940
00:52:16,075 --> 00:52:17,674
just like a Marine.

941
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:19,206
I've been practicing
for months now,

942
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:21,640
and I find it practical
for real combat.

943
00:52:21,642 --> 00:52:24,407
I'm certain the practicing it
will be beneficial

944
00:52:24,409 --> 00:52:26,173
for Marines on the battleground.

945
00:52:26,175 --> 00:52:27,907
Oh, you're certain, are you?

946
00:52:27,909 --> 00:52:31,240
So this kung fu bullshit's gonna
allow us to kill our enemies?

947
00:52:31,242 --> 00:52:32,840
Is that what you're
trying to say?

948
00:52:32,842 --> 00:52:34,440
Outstanding, Staff Sergeant.

949
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:36,273
[Gunny] You're a goddamn genius.

950
00:52:36,275 --> 00:52:39,173
Get this thing off my base now.

951
00:52:39,175 --> 00:52:41,342
You know nothing
of Chinese kung fu.

952
00:52:42,842 --> 00:52:44,175
[Gunny] Zero!

953
00:52:47,909 --> 00:52:49,206
[tense music]

954
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:51,173
All right,
Staff Sergeant Hartman,

955
00:52:51,175 --> 00:52:53,607
I'm gonna allow you
to prove those words.

956
00:52:53,609 --> 00:52:56,307
If you can defeat Colin
in a fair fight,

957
00:52:56,309 --> 00:52:57,473
then I'll consider,

958
00:52:57,475 --> 00:52:59,707
maybe allowing
your wooden girlfriend

959
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:01,007
to stay on the base.

960
00:53:01,009 --> 00:53:02,442
Is that understood?

961
00:53:05,175 --> 00:53:07,742

- [applause]
- [Gunny] Outstanding work.

973
00:53:52,142 --> 00:53:54,206
Very nice.

974
00:53:54,208 --> 00:53:56,041
You see this, men?

975
00:53:56,043 --> 00:53:59,440
Now this is karate.

976
00:53:59,442 --> 00:54:02,574
Your Chinese kung fu is only
good for folding laundry.

977
00:54:02,576 --> 00:54:06,842
It stays where it belongs and
that is the hell off my base.

978
00:54:08,509 --> 00:54:12,540
Now, because of
the Staff Sergeant's stupidity,

979
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:16,041
all you Chinese will run
an extra 30 laps today.

980
00:54:16,043 --> 00:54:21,774
And the Staff Sergeant himself
will run an extra 30 after that.

981
00:54:21,776 --> 00:54:23,108

- Mr. Ip.

- I have great news for you.
- What's up, Yonah?

[paper rustles]

Mm.

Mm?

[sighs]

00:55:35,043 --> 00:55:36,540
Did you forge the signature?

1001
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:39,206
Don't worry, it looks
the same as Dad's.

1002
00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:40,609
I am sure no one will notice.

1003
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:44,807
I don't understand what you kids
are thinking nowadays.

1004
00:55:44,809 --> 00:55:48,106
[Ip] You guys act without
thinking about the consequences.

1005
00:55:48,108 --> 00:55:51,409
[Yonah] What are you doing?
It took me a lot of effort.

1006
00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:54,809
[sighs]

1007
00:55:58,909 --> 00:56:02,707
Did it cross your mind that
your dad would be very upset?

1008
00:56:02,709 --> 00:56:05,674
I don't care. He doesn't care
if I'm happy anyway.

1009
00:56:05,676 --> 00:56:07,106
Why do you say that?

1010
00:56:07,108 --> 00:56:08,874
I think he cares about you.

1011
00:56:08,876 --> 00:56:10,240
He only cares about himself.

1012
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:11,507
He always pushes me
to practice Tai Chi

1013
00:56:11,509 --> 00:56:13,240
and to perform
at the Mid-Autumn Festival.

1014
00:56:13,242 --> 00:56:14,840
Just because he likes it.

1015
00:56:14,842 --> 00:56:15,742
[Yonah] But I don't.

1016
00:56:20,709 --> 00:56:23,874
If you don't like Tai Chi,
just tell him.

1017
00:56:23,876 --> 00:56:26,407
I did. He wouldn't listen.

1018
00:56:26,409 --> 00:56:28,106
In his eyes,
everything I do is wrong.

1019
00:56:28,108 --> 00:56:30,574
I fight back when I'm
being bullied, it's my fault.

1020
00:56:30,576 --> 00:56:32,874
I like cheerleading and dancing,
it's my fault.

1021
00:56:32,876 --> 00:56:35,941
I am always wrong.
He never supports me.

1022
00:56:35,943 --> 00:56:37,842
[Yonah] I don't believe
that's how other dads are like.

1023
00:56:38,742 --> 00:56:39,642
At the very least,

1024
00:56:40,342 --> 00:56:41,676
you are not, Mr. Ip.

1025
00:56:43,943 --> 00:56:46,442
[pensive music]

1026
00:56:59,842 --> 00:57:05,242
Is cheerleading your passion?

1027
00:57:09,142 --> 00:57:10,540
Not really.

1028
00:57:10,542 --> 00:57:13,273
I do it because I like it.

1029
00:57:13,275 --> 00:57:14,640
Mr. Ip, you are
so good at fighting.

1030
00:57:14,642 --> 00:57:16,309
Isn't it because
you like martial arts?

1031
00:57:19,842 --> 00:57:23,240
Ah! At the Mid-Autumn Festival,

1032
00:57:23,242 --> 00:57:25,574
why don't you do
your cheerleading dance?

1033
00:57:25,576 --> 00:57:28,240
Right, why haven't I
thought about that?

1034
00:57:28,242 --> 00:57:29,874
[Yonah] That's a great idea.

1035
00:57:29,876 --> 00:57:31,375
Mr. Ip, will you come?

1036
00:57:32,075 --> 00:57:33,473
Sure.

1037
00:57:33,475 --> 00:57:34,809
Great.

1038
00:57:36,108 --> 00:57:38,375
- Now go to school.
- Okay.

1039
00:57:42,776 --> 00:57:43,842
Off you go.

1040
00:57:47,442 --> 00:57:48,709
- Bye bye.
- [Yonah] Bye bye.

1041
00:58:05,375 --> 00:58:06,674
[Gabrielle] You finally decided
to come back, then,

1042
00:58:06,676 --> 00:58:07,574
Andrew, thank you.

1043
00:58:07,576 --> 00:58:09,440
I was in Washington DC,
Gabrielle.

1044
00:58:09,442 --> 00:58:10,840
I came back as soon as I could.
How's Becky?

1045
00:58:10,842 --> 00:58:13,607
She was almost disfigured
by a Chinese girl at school.

1046
00:58:13,609 --> 00:58:14,774
[Gabrielle] And I don't
understand the grounds

1047
00:58:14,776 --> 00:58:17,674
they let a Chinese student
in anyway.

1048
00:58:17,676 --> 00:58:19,574
What do you intend
to do about it?

1049
00:58:19,576 --> 00:58:21,842
What are the INS going to do
about those Chinese savages?

1050
00:58:23,108 --> 00:58:25,409
Get rid of them. Send them home!

1051
00:58:28,242 --> 00:58:30,140
Becky, honey, who...
who did this to you?

1052
00:58:30,142 --> 00:58:32,574
Yonah Wan.

1053
00:58:32,576 --> 00:58:33,874
She's the daughter
of the Chairman

1054
00:58:33,876 --> 00:58:37,475
of the Chinese
"Benelovent" Association,

1055
00:58:38,142 --> 00:58:39,640
or so she claims.

1056
00:58:39,642 --> 00:58:40,676
Chinatown.

1057
00:58:44,375 --> 00:58:45,742
I'll handle this.

1058

[film reel rustling]

Really impressive.

1061
00:59:05,175 --> 00:59:07,574
- So this is Chinese kung fu?
- Yes, sir.

1062
00:59:07,576 --> 00:59:10,007
It's really amazing.
I mean really amazing.

1063
00:59:10,009 --> 00:59:11,507
Thank you, sir.

1064
00:59:11,509 --> 00:59:13,674
This brochure has
a brief introduction

1065
00:59:13,676 --> 00:59:16,108
and here is the transcript
that I've prepared.

1066
00:59:17,043 --> 00:59:17,941
Actually, sir,

1067
00:59:17,943 --> 00:59:20,206
there's a martial arts event
taking place in Chinatown

1068
00:59:20,208 --> 00:59:21,373
during the Full Moon Festival.

1069
00:59:21,375 --> 00:59:22,473
With your permission,

1070
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:24,273
I'd like to go film it
and do some more research

1071
00:59:24,275 --> 00:59:26,273
so that we may further
investigate this matter.

1072
00:59:26,275 --> 00:59:27,774
- Chinatown?
- [Hartman] Yes, sir.

1073
00:59:27,776 --> 00:59:28,807
Granted.

1074
00:59:28,809 --> 00:59:30,307
Just don't make this
a waste of my time.

1075
00:59:30,309 --> 00:59:32,473
- Definitely not, sir.
- All right.

1076
00:59:32,475 --> 00:59:34,108
- [knocks on door]
- Come in.

1077
00:59:37,509 --> 00:59:38,640
Sir.

1078
00:59:38,642 --> 00:59:41,140
Please excuse
the Staff Sergeant's intrusion.

1079
00:59:41,142 --> 00:59:42,907
What the hell
are you doing here?

1080
00:59:42,909 --> 00:59:45,007
My job, as a Marine.

1081
00:59:45,009 --> 00:59:46,273
So that's all right.

1082
00:59:46,275 --> 00:59:48,373
So let's start
to explore the idea

1083
00:59:48,375 --> 00:59:50,707
of incorporating Chinese kung fu

1084
00:59:50,709 --> 00:59:52,907
into our hand to hand
combat training.

1085
00:59:52,909 --> 00:59:54,540
Now, Staff Sergeant Hartman

1086
00:59:54,542 --> 00:59:58,307
is gonna go to Chinatown
for research.

1087

[commanding officer]
I'd like you to start learning

1088
00:59:59,375 --> 01:00:01,574
something from this handbook.

1089
01:00:01,576 --> 01:00:02,742
Here, take it.

1090
01:00:06,576 --> 01:00:09,475
- Gentlemen, that's all.
- Sir.

Gunny?

1100
01:00:45,509 --> 01:00:47,574
You know there is not a doubt
in my mind

1101
01:00:47,576 --> 01:00:51,373
that karate is the best form of
hand to hand combat. Bar none.

1102
01:00:51,375 --> 01:00:53,640
But do you know what that
backstabbing son of a bitch

- Tell me.

that his bullshit kung fu

1105
01:00:59,709 --> 01:01:02,073
is more effective
than our karate training.

[heavy sigh]

I'm gonna need you to right
that wrong, Colin.

1108
01:01:05,442 --> 01:01:06,707
You just let me show
those people

1109
01:01:06,709 --> 01:01:08,774
the meaning
of real combat karate

1110
01:01:08,776 --> 01:01:11,941
and I'll shut those
kung fu charlatans up for good.

Mr. Ip, you are late.

1125
01:02:23,909 --> 01:02:27,674
I saved you a seat
next to the masters over there.

1126
01:02:27,676 --> 01:02:30,140
No worries.
I'll stay where I am.

and get ready to perform, okay?

Go on.

No, I came first.

My father, Wan Zhong Hua
has been taken by mistake.

1304
01:12:29,108 --> 01:12:30,640
I need to see him right now.

- I can't let you in.

- Grandmaster.
- [Ip] Billy.

1307
01:12:33,876 --> 01:12:35,707
- Can you help us?
- [Billy] I wish I could.

1308
01:12:35,709 --> 01:12:39,307
Her father, Mr. Wan Zhong Hua,
what happened?

1309
01:12:39,309 --> 01:12:41,874
I have no idea, sir.
But please take my advice.

1310
01:12:41,876 --> 01:12:44,707
Stay away from the Chinese
Benevolent Association tonight.

1311
01:12:44,709 --> 01:12:45,807
Tonight, don't go there.

1312
01:12:45,809 --> 01:12:48,407
All right? We're gonna raid
that place tonight.

1313
01:12:48,409 --> 01:12:51,275
I gotta go. But remember,
don't go there.

Who incited those karate guys
to come here?

1318
01:13:10,943 --> 01:13:12,907
They made a scene for no reason.

1319
01:13:12,909 --> 01:13:15,007
It must be Bruce Lee.

1320
01:13:15,009 --> 01:13:16,607
He dragged us into this.

1321

[Chen] Don't make
false assumptions.

1322

Where is he?

Uh, what do you want with him?

1365
01:15:39,375 --> 01:15:41,240
I'm Gunnery Sergeant

Second Battalion, Fifth Marines.

1367
01:15:43,375 --> 01:15:47,540
One of my men was assaulted
in Chinatown tonight.

1368
01:15:47,542 --> 01:15:50,073
Wan Zhong Hua is the chairman

1369
01:15:50,075 --> 01:15:51,473
of the Chinese
Benevolent Association.

1370
01:15:51,475 --> 01:15:53,776
I need him back
on my base tonight.

1371
01:15:56,142 --> 01:15:57,807
This man made me look bad.

1372
01:15:57,809 --> 01:15:58,842
[Gunny] It's personal.

1373
01:16:00,108 --> 01:16:01,540
So why don't you cooperate

1374
01:16:01,542 --> 01:16:03,140
or things are gonna get
pretty bad for you too.

1375
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:04,674
Do you understand?

1376
01:16:04,676 --> 01:16:05,807
So go and get him

1377
01:16:05,809 --> 01:16:07,776
and I'll worry
about the repercussions.

1378
01:16:10,742 --> 01:16:11,676
Follow me.

1379
01:16:21,609 --> 01:16:24,242
You're now officially in the
custody of the US Marines.

1380
01:16:25,542 --> 01:16:26,607
Just don't let him stay
in the country

1381
01:16:26,609 --> 01:16:27,674
when you're done
with him, all right?

1382
01:16:27,676 --> 01:16:30,275
My karate coach was defeated
in a fight tonight

by Chinese kung fu.

1384
01:16:34,876 --> 01:16:37,073
Since you're the representative
of Chinese kung fu,

1385
01:16:37,075 --> 01:16:39,075
I'm holding you
personally accountable.

[Gunny]
These Chinamen right here,

1387
01:16:42,208 --> 01:16:44,941
I just crushed all of them.

1388
01:16:44,943 --> 01:16:47,041
You're the only one left.

1389
01:16:47,043 --> 01:16:48,574
I need to fight you.

1390

01:16:49,542 --> 01:16:51,273
[Walters] What are you
doing here? Get out of here!

You're Becky's father, right?

1393
01:16:53,175 --> 01:16:55,273
Listen, it's all my fault.

1394
01:16:55,275 --> 01:16:57,173
It's nothing to do
with my father.

1395
01:16:57,175 --> 01:16:58,874
I'm sorry.

1396
01:16:58,876 --> 01:17:00,407
[Yonah] I beg you.

1397
01:17:00,409 --> 01:17:02,273
Please let my papa go.

Get up!

Don't kneel to these people.

1404
01:17:30,776 --> 01:17:31,776
You are right.

1405
01:17:33,275 --> 01:17:36,609
If you can't take it anymore,
then just don't.

1406
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:52,676
I will fight you.

1407
01:17:55,943 --> 01:17:56,842
Let's go.

1408
01:17:59,409 --> 01:18:00,742

01:18:39,943 --> 01:18:41,640
Good!

1421
01:18:41,642 --> 01:18:44,540
Move your asses, Marines!
Move it!

1422
01:18:44,542 --> 01:18:47,874
Move that ass!

Right hand, right knee.
Aye, sir.

1425
01:18:51,009 --> 01:18:53,874
Sit down! Sit down! Move it!

1426
01:18:53,876 --> 01:18:56,340
I try to be a fair man.

1427
01:18:56,342 --> 01:18:58,473
[Gunny] So since
Staff Sergeant Hartman

1428
01:18:58,475 --> 01:19:01,907
so desperately wants his
Chinese kung fu

1429
01:19:01,909 --> 01:19:04,607
to be part of our curriculum,

1430
01:19:04,609 --> 01:19:07,674
I'm happy to give up
my rack time

1431
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:09,874
and give a Chinese
representative

1432
01:19:09,876 --> 01:19:11,173
the chance to prove

1433
01:19:11,175 --> 01:19:16,776
their kung fu is actually useful
in a real combat situation.

1434
01:19:18,742 --> 01:19:19,774
Master Wan.

1435
01:19:19,776 --> 01:19:21,807
You don't have to accept
his challenge.

1436
01:19:21,809 --> 01:19:22,742
I have to.

1437
01:19:24,208 --> 01:19:27,242
If I back down,
I'm no longer Chinese.

1438
01:19:33,976 --> 01:19:35,240
[Gunny] No rules.

1439
01:19:35,242 --> 01:19:36,676
Fight till you drop.

1440
01:19:39,142 --> 01:19:41,140
Make sure you get
all these on film.

01:22:47,509 --> 01:22:50,275
You and your daughter look
a hell of a lot alike...

1466
01:22:52,809 --> 01:22:54,275
when you beg.

1467
01:22:57,676 --> 01:22:58,809
Enough!

1468
01:23:06,075 --> 01:23:07,309
[groans]

1469
01:23:08,009 --> 01:23:09,676
Uh...

1470
01:23:15,776 --> 01:23:17,073
[Hartman] Master Wan.

1471
01:23:17,075 --> 01:23:18,007
Master Wan.

1472
01:23:18,009 --> 01:23:21,206
[Gunny] Don't you think
I deserve a round of applause?

1473
01:23:21,208 --> 01:23:23,509
[applause]

1474
01:23:35,075 --> 01:23:38,774
[Tam] Those white people
always pick on our Chinatown.

1475
01:23:38,776 --> 01:23:41,407
They made a scene tonight
at the association.

1476
01:23:41,409 --> 01:23:43,307
They are getting way
out of line.

1477
01:23:43,309 --> 01:23:44,740
[Lui] That's right.

1478
01:23:44,742 --> 01:23:48,073
It's not the first time
the immigration officers came.

1479
01:23:48,075 --> 01:23:50,142
They harassed us for no reason.

1480
01:23:50,842 --> 01:23:52,507
[Chen] Yes.

1481
01:23:52,509 --> 01:23:56,140
My grandfather came here
as a hard labor worker.

1482
01:23:56,142 --> 01:23:57,974
He helped them
build the railway.

1483
01:23:57,976 --> 01:24:02,540
He helped the Americans connect
the east coast with the west.

1484
01:24:02,542 --> 01:24:05,273
It's all thanks
to Chinese labor.

1485
01:24:05,275 --> 01:24:06,740
Yet the American government

1486
01:24:06,742 --> 01:24:09,707
was never willing to acknowledge
our contribution.

1487
01:24:09,709 --> 01:24:12,407
They keep trying to kick us out
with all sorts of excuses.

1488
01:24:12,409 --> 01:24:14,540
The white guys are too arrogant.

1489
01:24:14,542 --> 01:24:16,275
[Lau] There's no equality here.

1490
01:24:16,943 --> 01:24:18,574
Bruce.

1491
01:24:18,576 --> 01:24:20,373
- We were too...
- Hey.

1492
01:24:20,375 --> 01:24:21,774
It's no big deal.

1493
01:24:21,776 --> 01:24:23,774
I didn't take it to heart.
Don't worry.

1494
01:24:23,776 --> 01:24:25,206
[relieved sigh]

1495
01:24:25,208 --> 01:24:26,507
[Chen] Master Ip.

1496
01:24:26,509 --> 01:24:28,640
- Thank you very much...
- [Ip] Hey.

1497
01:24:28,642 --> 01:24:29,807
Not at all.

1498
01:24:29,809 --> 01:24:31,507
All of us are Chinese.

1499
01:24:31,509 --> 01:24:33,507
We should help each other out.

1500
01:24:33,509 --> 01:24:34,774
[Law] That has always
been my belief.

1501
01:24:34,776 --> 01:24:36,340
Chinese people must help
each other out.

1502
01:24:36,342 --> 01:24:37,907
Right? Right?

1503
01:24:37,909 --> 01:24:38,807
- Yes.
- Spot on.

1504
01:24:38,809 --> 01:24:40,273
- Master Law is right.
- He's right.

1506
01:24:42,009 --> 01:24:43,275
[Tam] Okay.

1507
01:24:49,043 --> 01:24:51,540
- Hello.
- [Hartman] <i>Master.</i>

1508
01:24:51,542 --> 01:24:52,974
At the Mid-Autumn
Festival tonight,

1509
01:24:52,976 --> 01:24:53,907
the masters in Chinatown

1510
01:24:53,909 --> 01:24:55,509
had a conflict
with people from the army.

1511
01:24:56,642 --> 01:24:58,073
Master Wan is...

1512
01:24:58,075 --> 01:24:59,740
He is severely injured.

1513
01:24:59,742 --> 01:25:01,108

Little prick, you're
not answering the phone again!

1526
01:26:23,075 --> 01:26:24,842
- Hello.
- Bob.

1527
01:26:26,108 --> 01:26:27,340
Where is Ching?

1528
01:26:27,342 --> 01:26:29,540
He is practicing
with the wooden dummy.

[Bob] Master Ip, long-distance

1532
01:26:40,576 --> 01:26:41,475
Bob.

1533
01:26:48,909 --> 01:26:50,108
I have cancer.

Are you serious?

1537
01:26:58,876 --> 01:27:01,175
Actually, the reason
I hurried to America...

1538
01:27:03,776 --> 01:27:08,240
is to have a look here
and see if it's right for Ching.

1539
01:27:08,242 --> 01:27:09,509
Please let me talk to him.

1540
01:27:10,876 --> 01:27:11,776
Hold on.

1541
01:27:14,509 --> 01:27:16,108
[Bob] Your dad
is asking for you.

1542
01:27:16,909 --> 01:27:17,842
Answer the phone.

1543
01:27:18,842 --> 01:27:20,073
I won't take his call.

1544
01:27:20,075 --> 01:27:21,142
[Ching] <i>No way!</i>

1545
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:27,874
Listen to me.

1546
01:27:27,876 --> 01:27:29,275
I will only say it once.

1547
01:27:30,043 --> 01:27:31,509
Your dad has cancer.

1548
01:27:34,742 --> 01:27:36,776
He went to America
just to find you a school.

1549

- [Ching] <i>Dad.</i>
- Ching.

[Ching sobbing on the line]

1551
01:28:01,108 --> 01:28:04,542
It was my fault
for hitting you last time.

1552
01:28:07,642 --> 01:28:09,507
I am sorry.

1553
01:28:09,509 --> 01:28:11,175
[Ip] I know
you like martial arts.

1554
01:28:12,043 --> 01:28:13,475
I will teach you when I'm back.

1555
01:28:16,676 --> 01:28:17,576
Dad.

1556

[Ching] <i>When will
you be home?</i>

1557
01:28:22,642 --> 01:28:24,609
I still have something
to take care of.

1558
01:28:26,542 --> 01:28:29,409
Once it's done,
I will be right back.

Take me to the boot camp.

1564
01:29:10,876 --> 01:29:13,273
[Yonah] Mr. Ip, don't go.

1565
01:29:13,275 --> 01:29:14,776
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

1566
01:29:24,375 --> 01:29:27,473
I'm a martial artist.

1567
01:29:27,475 --> 01:29:30,809
In the face of injustice,
I must stand up and fight.

1568
01:29:32,309 --> 01:29:34,242
[Ip] That was why
we took up martial arts.

1569
01:29:35,208 --> 01:29:38,273
This is something I want to do.

1570
01:29:38,275 --> 01:29:40,375
Just like you want
to do cheerleading.

1571
01:29:56,943 --> 01:29:59,907
[Gunny] If you're lucky enough
to come to America,

Consider yourselves incredibly
honored to be here.

Incredibly honored!

1576

1580
01:30:25,876 --> 01:30:27,173

01:30:34,909 --> 01:30:38,407
<i>I had the unfortunate
but necessary task</i>

1585
01:30:38,409 --> 01:30:41,173
of demonstrating how
an inferior race

1586
01:30:41,175 --> 01:30:44,307
can and should be defeated.

1587

I'm sure you will all agree the
<i>results were quite definitive.</i>

So don't even think about
