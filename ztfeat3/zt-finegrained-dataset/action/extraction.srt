1
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,075
I think I'll watch a movie and...

2
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,963
Come on, let's go to my place.
We'll watch a movie.

3
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,581
It'll be great.
Come on.

4
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,642
...inside the school.
And then guess who found him?

5
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:50,496
Who?
Amit sir.

6
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:51,833
Oh!

7
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,633
That's epic! Good!

8
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,633
Go over and tell her who you are.

9
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,828
Get her one coffee.
No, I don't have money for it.

10
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,665
I'll pay for the coffee. Hey, hey, listen.

11
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,934
She's looking at you. She's blushing.

12
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,668
She's blushing. Dude, she wants you.

13
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,030
Go over and talk.
No, no, no.

14
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,786
That's Ovi, though.
Isn't that hilarious?

15
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:13,875
No! No!

16
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,575
Where have you been?

17
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,288
With friends.

18
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,878
Hasn't your father told you
to come straight home after school?

19
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,423
Hmm?

20
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,253
Okay.

21
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,581
Insane night pub. I'm gonna come back.

22
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:51,246

23
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,920

Oh!

26
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,880
Hey! What's up? Did you talk to her yet?

27
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,461
Ah!

28
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,751
Did you talk to her yet?

29
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,633
No.
Did he talk to...

30
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,418
Come on, Ovi.
You gotta go talk to her.

31
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,790
Oh, she's smiling.

32
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,248
I know what you need. Come on.

33
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,880
Try it. Take one hit, man, it'll help you.

34
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,365
Having fun tonight?
Drop it.

35
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,580
Ah...

36
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,996
Are you guys from inside? Huh?

37
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,420
I think you dropped something, no?

38
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,880
No!

39
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:45,958
No?

40
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,540
Did you buy this inside?

41
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,625
No, it's not ours.
Chill. Relax.

42
00:05:58,708 --> 00:05:59,878
It's all good.

43
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,418
You boys are lucky.

44
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,536
You got your whole lives ahead of you.

45
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,575
No!

46
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,293
You all leave.

47
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:38,705
Leave. Move fast.

48
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,331
I told you,
you dumb motherfucker,

49
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,251
to watch his every move...

50
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,375
...and yet Amir Asif has grabbed my son.

51
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:04,875
We can negotiate.

52
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,828
This isn't about ransom, Saju.

53
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:09,828
It's about humiliation.

54
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:18,963
Go to Dhaka.

55
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,250
And do what?

56
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:23,825
Steal him back.

57
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,583
I'd need an army, Ovi.

58
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,536
Then hire a fucking army!

59
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,668
What do you think?

60
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:38,786
You think I can't hurt you from here?

61
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,080
Ovi, please...

62
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:46,956
You want your son
to see his next birthday?

63
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,383
Then...

64
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,538
get mine back.

65
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,331
Tell Mahajan to pay the ransom
and get his son back.

66
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,306
Why are they getting us involved in this?

67
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:22,536
Neysa...

68
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,418
There's not enough money.

69
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,326
The NCB have frozen Mahajan's assets.

70
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,208
I'm all he's got.

71
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,750
You understand?

72
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,456
Animals!

73
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,168
There's a man who does
this sort of thing.

74
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:48,286
His price will be out of Mahajan's reach.

75
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,666
But there's a way I can play this.

76
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,250
It will not be easy.

77
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:55,878
Do whatever you have to.

78
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,330
Christ! That is high.

79
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,208
It's only 30 meters.

80
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,376
Fuckin' high.

81
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,583
It's fuckin' beautiful, though.
Mmm-hmm.

82
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,166
He okay?

83
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,291
He's fine.

84
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,873
You sure, bruh?
'Cause he looks fuckin' dead.

85
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,541
Quit swearin' all the time.

86
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,496
So?
It makes you sound stupid.

87
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,173
Find another fuckin' adjective.

88
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,333
Told you he's fine.

89
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,208
♪ Oh and the night will look back ♪

90
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,883
♪ I'm gonna travel all day all night ♪

91
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,633
Hold my beer, would you?
Oh, I gotcha.

92
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,633
I said hold it. Don't drink it.
I gotcha.

93
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,461
Christ!

94
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,208
Come here, girl.

95
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:37,875
Hey.

96
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,418
Make yourself at home.

97
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,003
There's a chicken in your bathroom.

98
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:04,133
Yeah, I like chickens,
except when they shit everywhere.

99
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,331
We landed the whale.

100
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:17,881
Oh, yeah?

101
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,998
Extraction. Indian kid.

102
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,503
Drug lord's son.

103
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,793
A rival gangster is holding
this kid in Dhaka.

104
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:25,961
I think Gaspar lives in Dhaka.

105
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,581
Gaspar is out of the game.

106
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,380
Clock's running at 16 hours.
Deadline, Friday, noon.

107
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,920
Proof of life as of six hours ago.

108
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,251
Yeah, I'll take it.

109
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:55,171
This gangster, Amir Asif,
he holds a massive sway in Dhaka.

110
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,880
You get your hands on this kid,
it's gonna get complicated.

111
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,376
It's always fuckin' complicated, innit?

112
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,578
This was a mistake.

113
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,210
God, Nik, what are you doing here?

114
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,711
Don't bullshit yourself.

115
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,083
No one else is gonna commit
to somethin' this fucked up.

116
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,418
And why would you?

117
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,461
I need the money.

118
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,328
Chickens aren't cheap.

119
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,921
You're hoping
if you spin the chamber enough times,

120
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,790
you're gonna catch a bullet.

121
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:55,496
Tomorrow morning,
I'll meet you in Fitzroy Crossing.

122
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,543
If you're not sober, don't show up.

123
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,173
What's his name?

124
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:11,753
Ovi. Ovi Mahajan.

125
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,076
Head on straight, Tyler.

126
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:04,213
This is our extract.
Ovi Mahajan, 14 years old.

127
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,291
His father, Ovi Mahajan Senior,
is in jail.

128
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,955
So, his people employed us
to get the boy back,

129
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,211
and they refuse to negotiate.

130
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,631
What about our opposition?

131
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,918
Amir Asif.
Dhaka's very own Pablo Escobar.

132
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,330
Biggest drug lord in India
versus biggest drug lord in Bangladesh.

133
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,666
Sounds like some mythic shit.

134
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,040
A lot of bad blood between them.

135
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:27,325
This is our extraction point.
So, José and Thiago will man a boat,

136
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:31,126
ferry you and the kid nine miles
down the river to a chopper.

137
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,458
Any questions?
How many hostiles on site?

138
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:37,496
Maybe 20. Okay, clock is ticking.
Let's chop-chop!

139
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,253
You see the laundry
across the street?

140
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,333
Yep.

141
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,375
Walk to it.

142
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,458
Now what?

143
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,331
Welcome to Dhaka.

144
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,791
Do we look like we muck
around? Give us the money and get lost.

145
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,115
Show me the proof.

146
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,043
Proof.

147
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:12,916
Money.

148
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:14,541
Proof.

149
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,168
Show me proof.

150
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,830
Money!

151
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,892
You show me the kid's
all right, I tell my people, they pay you.

152
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,576
Do you under...

153
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,708
Fuck... come here. Hey!

154
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,036
Listen, you boys seem
like real busy professionals,

155
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,575
so let's say we cut this shit
and get down to business, yeah?

156
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Okay.

157
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,416
Bastard!

158
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,248
Didn't even blink!

159
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,053
Hey, man,
you're crazy or what?

160
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,793
There's no magazine in it.

161
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,205
Boom!

162
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,210
Enough talk.

163
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,248
Let's get to business.

164
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:32,583
No.

165
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:33,905
Come on, boy!

166
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,205
Show me your face.

167
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,383
Beautiful!

168
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,168
Good night!

169
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,920
No. No.

170
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,498
Now you go.

171
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,786
Tell them. Pay.

172
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,206
If not?

173
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,165
I take this...

174
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,706
stick in his ass and blow his insides out.

175
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,455
Move it!

176
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,171
Let's go!

177
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,543
Hey, you!

178
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:03,538
No! No! No! No! No!

179
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:04,825
Shh!

180
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,125
Who are you?

181
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:16,245
Can you walk?
Yeah.

182
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:18,753
All right. Put this on.

183
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:19,416
No! No, Amir, no! Amir, no!

184
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,540
Swine.

185
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:31,131
Sons of bitches.

186
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,210
Anybody feel like they remember now?

187
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Huh?

188
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,083
Wait!

189
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:41,041
I know...

190
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:48,416
I know who took the money.
Who?

191
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,130
Sanjib.
Who's Sanjib?

192
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:52,498
You just threw him off the roof.

193
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:57,166
Come here.

194
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:06,288
What's your name?

195
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:07,666
Farhad.

196
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:08,916
Farhad?

197
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:12,326
You're pretty clever.

198
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:17,075
Pay attention...

199
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:18,458
and learn...

200
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:20,673
that's how you survive.

201
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,750
You need to be smart. Use your wits.

202
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:27,713
Eh, Farhad?

203
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,043
Cut off two of your fingers.

204
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,578
Any two.

205
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:45,923
Why?

206
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,670
Because the kid who stole from me is dead.

207
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:53,883
And I'd like a walking reminder

208
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:57,495
of what happens when you touch my money.

209
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,460
I'd recommend the left hand.

210
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:08,495
So you can still hold a gun.

211
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:16,996
Amir!

212
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:18,423
I am talking!

213
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,750
Amir, we lost the kid.

214
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:31,753
Clever and lucky...

215
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,920
Close the city.

216
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,790
Bridges, trains, airports...

217
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:43,165
Close everything.

218
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,830
Impossible, Amir.

219
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:51,745
Make it possible, Colonel,

220
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:56,246
or you'll lose more than just a finger.

221
00:26:58,291 --> 00:26:59,291
Hmm?

222
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:20,078
Okay, get out. Let's go.

223
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:28,213
Here. Hey.

224
00:27:38,416 --> 00:27:40,416
Kid, you wanna survive,
you do exactly as I say.

225
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,790
Here. Put these on.

226
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:07,925
Here, eat this. Your blood sugar is low.
That's why you feel like shit.

227
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:20,418
Twenty-one hundred meters out.
In possession.

228
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,040
Copy.
Alpha team is with the boat. In position.

229
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:28,923
All right. Arms up.

230
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,418
Okay. All right. Name?

231
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:53,083
Say your name, mate.

232
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,880
Say your bloody name, come on.

233
00:28:57,541 --> 00:28:58,961
Ovi.
Last name?

234
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:00,455
Mahajan.

235
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:01,711
Your birthday?

236
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:03,711
Twenty-first of January, 2005.

237
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,630
Proceeding to extraction. Let's go.

238
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:25,705
Satellite's online.
Rake and the kid are en route.

239
00:29:29,791 --> 00:29:30,791
You good?

240
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,580
Good.

241
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:49,503
You guys ready for us?
We're 1,600 meters out.

242
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:50,713
Ready and waiting.

243
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:51,851
Copy. See you soon.

244
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,705
Last name?
Mahajan.

245
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:56,711
Your birthday?
Twenty-first of January, 2005.

246
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:02,881
Sending proof of possession.

247
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:05,495
You have seven minutes
to transfer the funds.

248
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,830
It's G. I'm in position.

249
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:21,642
There's an alarm
going off in the engine room.

250
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:24,326
G, I need you to be my eyes.
Copy that.

251
00:30:24,916 --> 00:30:26,642
Blockades have been set up

252
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:28,186
on every bridge into and out of Dhaka.

253
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:31,668
I have teams combing
the Buriganga as we speak.

254
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,170
We'll find them, sir.

255
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:40,333
I like this one.

256
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:43,955
Get him a gun. Put his fingers to work.

257
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:05,713
I... I can't breathe.

258
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:09,383
Deep breath, mate. Deep breath.

259
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:14,496
Yeah, we gotta keep moving. Come on.

260
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:28,253
Rake's about five minutes from the boat.

261
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:30,583
Where are we at with the transfer?

262
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:35,828
Where is it?

263
00:31:35,916 --> 00:31:38,376
I don't know.
Well, try it again.

264
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,670
Nada.
Fuckin' shit.

265
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:00,960
Call them back. Tell them they have
60 seconds to make the transfer.

266
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:03,881
Otherwise they're gonna find a boy's body
floating in the Buriganga.

267
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:15,745
We're getting played.

268
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,630
Give me verbal.
 G here.

269
00:32:21,291 --> 00:32:22,291
Thiago?

270
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,378
Thiago?
Shit.

271
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:29,456
Thiago?

272
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,626
Tyler, something's wrong.
Hold your position.

273
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:34,708
Holding.

274
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:37,878
G, you got the eyes on the boat?

275
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:40,828
I'm looking at it right now.
Our boys haven't come up yet.

276
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:42,536
I'm moving in for a closer look.

277
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:48,630
Colonel, stand by.
We think we found something.

278
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:51,418
Nik, you're gonna wanna see this.
What is it?

279
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:53,708
Shit!

280
00:32:53,791 --> 00:32:55,671
Tyler, two inbound police boats.

281
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,380
Two hundred meters and closing in fast.
G?

282
00:33:06,541 --> 00:33:07,981
There's someone else in those woods.

283
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:11,003
About a hundred meters out
and closing in on your position.

284
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:42,458
Kid... Move fast. Stay low. Go!

285
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:56,291
They found the boat.

286
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:00,456
We need air support
by the river.

287
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:02,001
They're in the forest.

288
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:03,923
Tyler, chopper's inbound.

289
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,500
Go, go!

290
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:20,415
Down.

291
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,790
Ovi, it's Saju!

292
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:23,666
I'm here to take you home!

293
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,920
Saju, I'm here!
Sit down and shut up!

294
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:35,746
I need the boy! I won't hurt him!

295
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:39,713
Okay, when I tell you to, run like hell
or I'm gonna kill you both. Understand?

296
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,750
Go!

297
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:49,208
Okay kid, go!

298
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:53,995
Go on, kid. Go, go! Go! Come on.

299
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:55,963
Ovi!
Move, boy!

300
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:58,501
Here, get in the car. Get in the car.
Stop running!

301
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:22,434
Shit!

302
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:27,078
Come on! Go!

303
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:36,461
Get down!

304
00:35:36,541 --> 00:35:37,961
Saju! Help!

305
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:42,125
Hey! Hey!

306
00:35:42,625 --> 00:35:44,575
Please let me go!
Saju works for my father.

307
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:47,456
I work for your father.
But something is fucked here.

308
00:35:47,541 --> 00:35:50,392
Saju could have a deal with the men
who grabbed you and send you back to them.

309
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:52,626
Then take me to the police.
The cops are in on it.

310
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:54,708
Look, if you wanna live,
you have to trust me.

311
00:35:56,541 --> 00:35:58,881
I need eyes. Radio's compromised.
Call my sat.

312
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:02,642
Turn right,
after the bridge.

313
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:04,426
How far past the gate?
What gate?

314
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:08,286
Turn right.
Can't. Bloody truck is in the way.

315
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,960
Tyler, on your right.

316
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:23,166
Fuck off!

317
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,980
Up ahead, make a left.

318
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:08,998
No, no, no! Left! You just passed it.

319
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:10,173
For fuck's sake!

320
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:15,916
Get down!

321
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:30,711
I'm in survival mode.

322
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,075
Put your belt on.
What belt?

323
00:37:34,166 --> 00:37:35,326
Your fucking seat belt.

324
00:37:35,416 --> 00:37:37,536
It's been on.
You drive like you're insane!

325
00:37:38,958 --> 00:37:39,958
Hold tight.

326
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:45,326
You okay, kid?
I'm fine.

327
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:47,746
We gotta move. Go. Up the stairs.

328
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:05,776
Go, go, go!

329
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:30,631
This way.

330
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:36,078
Shh.

331
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:39,536
Come on. Come on.

332
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:47,833
Move!

333
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,880
Help! Help! Help!

334
00:40:20,416 --> 00:40:22,376
Come here.

335
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:33,788
Come here, you little shit...

336
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:04,415
Run, go.

337
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,540
Get up the stairs. Go. Come on. Move!

338
00:41:24,458 --> 00:41:25,458
Get down.

339
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:29,321
All right, kid. Do you trust me?

340
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:30,495
No.
Good.

341
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:32,583
No!

342
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:39,665
Get up, kid.

343
00:41:54,791 --> 00:41:56,001
Okay!

344
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:09,955
Stay on my shoulder, all right?

345
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:00,165
Fuck.

346
00:44:14,458 --> 00:44:16,788
Help me! Let me go!

347
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:24,915
Let me go!

348
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:29,205
Help!

349
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:31,434
Hey,
I am telling you to stop.

350
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:32,788
Stop there or I will kill you.

351
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:42,625
Are you hurt?

352
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:08,383
Get in, kid. Come on. Come on!

353
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:15,746
You hit him with the truck.
Yeah.

354
00:45:24,875 --> 00:45:26,245
They're still following us.

355
00:45:29,833 --> 00:45:30,833
Hold on.

356
00:46:07,666 --> 00:46:10,076
All right, kid.
I need you to slide on over here.

357
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:13,596
Okay, we're gonna jump on three.
All right?

358
00:46:13,666 --> 00:46:14,916
What?
One...

359
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:35,198
The vehicle
crashed. It flipped over and is in flames.

360
00:46:37,291 --> 00:46:38,751
I want to see the bodies.

361
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:42,883
We're coming.

362
00:47:37,166 --> 00:47:38,486
They're still alive.

363
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:41,540
One is seriously injured.

364
00:47:44,791 --> 00:47:49,421
I want every gun in Dhaka
pointed at this guy.

365
00:48:06,208 --> 00:48:07,848
All right. Close the door.
Close the door.

366
00:48:45,833 --> 00:48:46,833
Can you give me a hand?

367
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,960
I need eyes. Hold that on there.

368
00:48:52,583 --> 00:48:55,043
Just hook it through there
and then pull it back this way.

369
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:56,125
Yeah.

370
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:02,083
Yep.

371
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:03,458
Yeah?
Yeah, I got it.

372
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,830
Yeah?

373
00:49:19,916 --> 00:49:22,876
Our new friend is Saju Rav.
Ex-Special Forces.

374
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:24,668
He works for the kid's father.

375
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,500
We were played.

376
00:49:29,583 --> 00:49:31,213
Second transfer never came through.

377
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:34,960
Mahajan got us to do the heavy lifting,
and he doesn't wanna pay.

378
00:49:35,583 --> 00:49:36,583
What about G?

379
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:39,043
The whole team is dead.

380
00:49:39,708 --> 00:49:40,708
Shit.

381
00:49:42,375 --> 00:49:45,665
City's on lockdown. You got cover?
Yeah.

382
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,083
And the kid?

383
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:50,583
He's with me.

384
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:54,785
There's a clearing on east side
of Sultana Kamal Bridge,

385
00:49:54,875 --> 00:49:58,625
just outside the city.
We can send a chopper and get you out.

386
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:02,416
How far?
Four kilometers.

387
00:50:06,416 --> 00:50:08,326
You gotta leave the kid behind, Tyler.

388
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:17,666
Tyler?

389
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:25,250
Tyler?

390
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:29,958
That's not the job.

391
00:50:30,041 --> 00:50:31,501
The job is fucked.

392
00:50:36,791 --> 00:50:38,381
Just find my money, Nik.

393
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:52,535
Are you gonna
leave me in the street?

394
00:50:55,166 --> 00:50:57,166
Your phone... It's loud.

395
00:50:59,916 --> 00:51:02,666
The only chance
of getting my money is you, mate. So...

396
00:51:03,916 --> 00:51:04,916
no.

397
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:10,130
I'm like a package then.

398
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:13,330
Yeah, pretty much.

399
00:51:14,791 --> 00:51:16,291
In brown paper.

400
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:26,705
What are you doing?

401
00:51:27,333 --> 00:51:28,333
This?

402
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:32,963
Piano. I play the piano when I'm nervous.

403
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:35,375
It helps.

404
00:51:36,958 --> 00:51:38,668
My father hates it when I do it.

405
00:51:44,125 --> 00:51:46,075
He thinks of me the same way you do.

406
00:51:48,416 --> 00:51:50,036
More like a thing than a person.

407
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,630
I didn't... I didn't mean it like that.

408
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
It's okay.

409
00:52:42,958 --> 00:52:43,958
Sir.

410
00:52:44,708 --> 00:52:46,078
How many beds?

411
00:53:34,291 --> 00:53:35,291
Saju?

412
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:37,576
Hey, beautiful.

413
00:53:39,541 --> 00:53:40,751
Are you okay?

414
00:53:41,416 --> 00:53:42,996
Listen to me carefully.

415
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:46,423
If you don't hear from me
in the next 12 hours...

416
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:49,881
take the cash and go.

417
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:52,920
Disappear.

418
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:56,670
You understand me, right?

419
00:53:57,666 --> 00:53:58,826
I understand.

420
00:54:00,208 --> 00:54:01,288
Are you okay?

421
00:54:02,625 --> 00:54:03,625
I'm fine.

422
00:54:05,333 --> 00:54:06,963
Just tired.

423
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,206
I love you.

424
00:54:14,166 --> 00:54:15,246
I love you, too.

425
00:54:17,583 --> 00:54:19,003
Put Aarav on the phone.

426
00:54:22,708 --> 00:54:25,038
Aarav,
Papa's on the phone.

427
00:54:27,708 --> 00:54:28,708
Sadia.

428
00:54:30,625 --> 00:54:31,875
Hello, Papa.

429
00:54:32,458 --> 00:54:33,788
Hey, champ.

430
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,080
Are you coming home soon?

431
00:54:37,791 --> 00:54:40,751
Yes, it'll be very soon.

432
00:54:40,833 --> 00:54:41,753
When?

433
00:54:41,833 --> 00:54:42,833
When?

434
00:54:46,166 --> 00:54:48,126
When you wake up in the morning.

435
00:54:51,666 --> 00:54:53,826
You help your mother, okay?

436
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:57,793
Yes, Papa, I will.

437
00:54:59,666 --> 00:55:01,076
I love you.

438
00:55:04,416 --> 00:55:05,416
Always.

439
00:55:08,083 --> 00:55:09,753
I love you too, Papa.

440
00:55:11,625 --> 00:55:12,625
Bye.

441
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:30,580
Yeah.

442
00:55:30,666 --> 00:55:33,416
You got a chopper.
Meet you at the east side of the bridge.

443
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,750
Copy. I'm on the move.

444
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,920
Kid. Kid. Hey, come on.

445
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:52,875
Hey.

446
00:55:55,875 --> 00:55:56,875
Get in, go.

447
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:15,205
Come on, you bastard.

448
00:56:22,541 --> 00:56:23,541
Get out of the car.

449
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:27,581
Go, go, go, go, go!

450
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:36,923
Stay there!
Yeah.

451
00:56:54,083 --> 00:56:57,793
Hey, this guy wants my gun!
My ankle is broken!

452
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,326
Leave my gun.

453
00:57:01,416 --> 00:57:02,666
Leave it!

454
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:04,710
My friend is gonna shoot you!

455
00:57:04,791 --> 00:57:07,251
Hey! Give me my gun... Give it back!

456
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:09,333
That's my gun. Give it back to me!

457
00:57:10,666 --> 00:57:13,466
Give it back or I'll blow you away!
I will finish you off.

458
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:15,170
The fuck?

459
00:58:00,458 --> 00:58:01,578
Son of a bitch!

460
00:58:01,666 --> 00:58:03,786
I will finish you off!

461
00:58:20,583 --> 00:58:21,963
I'll kill you!

462
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,540
I'll murder you.

463
00:58:26,583 --> 00:58:28,213
Piss off!

464
00:58:29,916 --> 00:58:31,536
Fucking shits.

465
00:58:31,625 --> 00:58:33,745
You are surrounded.

466
00:58:33,833 --> 00:58:35,583
Please surrender to DMP

467
00:58:35,666 --> 00:58:38,126
or else you will be shot.
Fuck! Come on. We gotta move.

468
00:58:38,208 --> 00:58:43,208
Shit! Go, go, go, go, go!

469
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,040
All right. Get in.

470
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:22,288
Talk to me.

471
00:59:22,375 --> 00:59:24,125
Call Gaspar.
What's going on?

472
00:59:24,208 --> 00:59:27,878
We just got attacked by the Goonies
from hell. We made it about four blocks.

473
00:59:27,958 --> 00:59:29,458
I said get rid of the kid.

474
00:59:29,541 --> 00:59:31,251
I don't give a shit what you said.

475
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:33,333
We're in the worst smelling sewer
on the planet.

476
00:59:33,416 --> 00:59:36,456
There's about 200 cops over our heads.
Just call Gaspar.

477
00:59:36,541 --> 00:59:40,171
Tyler, I don't think that's a good idea.
The guy owes me his life, Nik.

478
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:42,000
Tyler, I...
Call him.

479
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,500
Your name's Tyler?

480
00:59:56,666 --> 00:59:57,666
Mmm-hmm.

481
01:00:03,291 --> 01:00:04,421
I'm Ovi.

482
01:00:07,083 --> 01:00:08,173
Nice to meet ya.

483
01:00:46,625 --> 01:00:48,535
Ugh, Jesus Christ!

484
01:01:17,208 --> 01:01:18,668
Hey, how's it going?

485
01:01:19,416 --> 01:01:20,916
Yeah, better after the shower.

486
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:35,083
Cheers.

487
01:01:41,875 --> 01:01:43,125
Good to see you, man.

488
01:01:44,916 --> 01:01:46,326
I appreciate you coming for us.

489
01:01:46,875 --> 01:01:48,875
The hell is wrong with you?
Don't insult me.

490
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:53,383
You hungry?
Yeah.

491
01:01:53,458 --> 01:01:54,538
Hey, how's that kid?

492
01:01:55,166 --> 01:01:56,416
Uh, he's resting.

493
01:01:58,666 --> 01:01:59,826
So, where are we?

494
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:03,920
We are south of the city center.

495
01:02:04,416 --> 01:02:08,876
I told Nik that an extraction is...
It's not feasible.

496
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:11,418
Well, you know, the city
is surrounded by rivers.

497
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,080
There are bridges going in and out.

498
01:02:13,166 --> 01:02:18,416
But every one of those bridges currently
is blocked by a roadblock

499
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:21,830
because you are a very popular individual.

500
01:02:24,666 --> 01:02:28,246
I figure we lie low a couple days,
we let the panic dissipate.

501
01:02:28,333 --> 01:02:33,503
And we'll get you going.
Now, my wife made that.

502
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,583
So, I want you to be very careful
what you say.

503
01:02:36,416 --> 01:02:37,416
Your wife?

504
01:02:40,125 --> 01:02:41,455
And what's that for, the knee?

505
01:02:42,083 --> 01:02:44,333
Yeah, knee, back, shoulder...

506
01:02:44,875 --> 01:02:49,205
Hang on one sec... my knee.
Ow! Oh, God. Oh, it hurts.

507
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:51,456
Two oughta do it.

508
01:02:56,958 --> 01:02:59,628
Okay. I gotta go. I gotta go.

509
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:01,575
I gotta kiss my wife.

510
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:06,673
But you stay here and rest up.
And I will be back.

511
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:11,793
It's good to see you, man. I missed you.

512
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:17,645
Don't you see I'm eating?

513
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,080
I had him...
Had who?

514
01:04:20,166 --> 01:04:21,826
The man you want.

515
01:04:22,416 --> 01:04:24,416
I lost him...

516
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:25,630
near the market.

517
01:04:26,625 --> 01:04:28,625
Tell them to scour the market.

518
01:04:28,708 --> 01:04:29,918
Yes, sir.

519
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,290
What is this?
A gift.

520
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,500
When you catch him,

521
01:04:44,583 --> 01:04:46,673
I want to be the one to pull the trigger.

522
01:04:47,333 --> 01:04:49,543
If you let me do that,

523
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:52,665
I'll give you the other finger!

524
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:09,960
He made me feel like a fool.

525
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:12,710
Of course he did.

526
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:18,455
You're only a kid. Hmm?

527
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:41,328
Here's some advice, a gift.

528
01:05:43,333 --> 01:05:46,583
Keep your other finger.

529
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:51,130
Because no matter how badass
you think you are...

530
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:55,460
there's always a badass
who's bigger than you.

531
01:06:19,125 --> 01:06:20,125
Tyler.

532
01:06:22,375 --> 01:06:23,375
Yeah?

533
01:06:24,916 --> 01:06:28,786
If you had been killed today,
it would have been my fault.

534
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,750
No, mate. But it would've been my fault.

535
01:06:36,666 --> 01:06:38,206
You don't look like a Tyler.

536
01:06:41,041 --> 01:06:42,211
No?

537
01:06:42,291 --> 01:06:43,331
What do I look like?

538
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:47,416
A Brad.

539
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:52,875
Yeah.

540
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:58,000
Can I ask you something?

541
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:00,500
It's Rake.

542
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,210
What's Rake?
My last name.

543
01:07:04,208 --> 01:07:05,918
That's not what I was going to ask.

544
01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:08,875
That's a strange last name, though.

545
01:07:10,208 --> 01:07:12,128
Isn't that like a gardening tool?

546
01:07:16,291 --> 01:07:17,501
What were you gonna ask me?

547
01:07:19,666 --> 01:07:25,666
If you were always this way.
You know... brave.

548
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:27,671
I'm not brave, mate.

549
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:33,290
Of course you are. You rescue people.

550
01:07:34,666 --> 01:07:38,666
Yeah, sometimes.
Sometimes I do other things.

551
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:42,875
Like killing people?

552
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,791
Yeah.

553
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:51,173
My father, he kills people, too.

554
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:58,790
Sometimes, I would sit with him at dinner,
look at him and think,

555
01:08:00,416 --> 01:08:02,746
he just killed somebody else's father
that day.

556
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:05,791
And I'd feel sick.

557
01:08:25,041 --> 01:08:26,461
You have a family?

558
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:31,253
I did have me a wife.

559
01:08:32,166 --> 01:08:33,206
Where is she?

560
01:08:34,208 --> 01:08:37,788
I don't know.
I haven't seen her in a long time.

561
01:08:39,833 --> 01:08:41,083
Children?

562
01:08:43,416 --> 01:08:44,626
Yeah, a son.

563
01:08:46,125 --> 01:08:47,205
Where is he?

564
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:55,205
He died a few years ago.

565
01:08:58,500 --> 01:08:59,630
How did he die?

566
01:09:02,041 --> 01:09:03,041
Lymphoma.

567
01:09:12,041 --> 01:09:13,041
How old was he?

568
01:09:16,625 --> 01:09:17,625
Six.

569
01:09:26,916 --> 01:09:30,876
I wasn't even there... when he died.

570
01:09:33,333 --> 01:09:34,753
Where were you?

571
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,130
Kandahar, Afghanistan.
It was my third tour.

572
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:43,378
You were called away?

573
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:53,208
No.

574
01:09:57,875 --> 01:09:58,995
I left.

575
01:10:01,833 --> 01:10:02,963
Voluntary.

576
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:09,245
Because you couldn't watch?

577
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:16,125
Yep.

578
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:25,630
I told you, mate. I'm not brave.
I'm just...

579
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,920
I'm just the opposite.

580
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:33,375
You know...

581
01:10:36,875 --> 01:10:41,325
"You drown not by falling into the river,

582
01:10:43,041 --> 01:10:44,881
but by staying submerged in it."

583
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:50,921
Who told you that?

584
01:10:52,083 --> 01:10:53,753
I read it in a book in school.

585
01:11:31,791 --> 01:11:35,881
Estancia Los Chanares.

586
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,208
Yes. Yes!
I don't know...

587
01:11:38,291 --> 01:11:39,921
It's the best dove hunting in Argentina.

588
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:44,213
Just lie in this pool...
You lie in a pool and they fly around!

589
01:11:45,833 --> 01:11:48,463
And you shoot them.

590
01:11:48,541 --> 01:11:50,171
And you sip a Cuba Libre.

591
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:55,458
I shot my first dove when I was
ten years old. Have I told you this?

592
01:11:55,541 --> 01:11:57,421
I haven't. Listen.
I think you have.

593
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:02,080
No. It was when I was ten years old,
my dad... My dad... The gun backfired,

594
01:12:02,166 --> 01:12:04,996
gave me a black eye,
and my dad laughs at me.

595
01:12:05,083 --> 01:12:09,083
I used to move so quick,
kill those little shits.

596
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:11,375
Not anymore, though.

597
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,920
It sucks getting old, man. Sucks!

598
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,830
Getting old sucks.
Shh.

599
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:18,206
Sucks!

600
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,250
I think he's asleep.

601
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,540
What a goddamn tragedy, hmm?

602
01:12:31,416 --> 01:12:33,666
That kid is a walking corpse.

603
01:12:40,416 --> 01:12:42,076
Asif will never let him live.

604
01:12:44,041 --> 01:12:45,291
Think the disgrace.

605
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:50,705
I mean, you get him home. And then, what?
His father's in prison.

606
01:12:52,041 --> 01:12:53,541
There's no way to protect him.

607
01:12:57,541 --> 01:12:59,181
You know what the best thing
you could do?

608
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:02,128
The best thing you could do, honestly,
would be to go up there right now

609
01:13:02,916 --> 01:13:05,916
and just go put a bullet in his brain.
Make it painless.

610
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,580
'Cause the animals out there,
they're not gonna be... as kind to him.

611
01:13:14,875 --> 01:13:16,535
They like to start with the ears.

612
01:13:17,875 --> 01:13:20,665
Then they cut off
each finger at the joint.

613
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:21,830
Mate, you're drunk.

614
01:13:25,333 --> 01:13:27,423
I'm talking about mercy, Tyler.

615
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:37,790
You know how much he's worth?

616
01:13:39,208 --> 01:13:40,568
We're talking about a kid, Gaspar.

617
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:42,495
We're talking about a gangster's kid.

618
01:13:44,708 --> 01:13:46,538
With a price tag
of ten million on his head.

619
01:13:46,625 --> 01:13:48,165
You need to sober up, mate.

620
01:13:49,541 --> 01:13:53,881
You're a mercenary, right, Tyler?
Why don't you act the mercenary?

621
01:13:54,833 --> 01:13:57,463
Aren't you sick of this life?
'Cause I am and I...

622
01:13:58,833 --> 01:14:03,673
I do not wanna end it playing hero
on some goddamn suicide mission...

623
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:05,540
What are you doing?
You said you'd help me.

624
01:14:05,625 --> 01:14:08,705
I am helping you. Ten million dollars.

625
01:14:10,375 --> 01:14:12,325
I'll get you to the border
in a couple hours.

626
01:14:12,416 --> 01:14:16,706
It's money in your pocket.
I take care of the body. Painless.

627
01:14:16,791 --> 01:14:18,581
And it's the best that
that kid can hope for.

628
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Did you call someone?

629
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:23,916
Who'd you call?

630
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,580
Why are you such a hypocrite? You've got
the blood of a hundred men on your hands...

631
01:14:27,666 --> 01:14:28,666
Answer me!

632
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:32,383
Put your hands on me?

633
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:33,458
What'd you do?

634
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:37,000
Do you know what happens to me
if they find out that I'm helping you?

635
01:14:37,083 --> 01:14:39,083
You know what happens to my wife?

636
01:14:40,625 --> 01:14:41,625
Asif's a friend.

637
01:14:42,916 --> 01:14:45,286
I did some work for him.
We made a deal.

638
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,960
He gets the kid, you get your freedom,
and we both get rich.

639
01:14:50,041 --> 01:14:52,501
What do you want from me?
Walk upstairs and shoot the kid

640
01:14:52,583 --> 01:14:53,633
in the fucking head?

641
01:14:53,708 --> 01:14:57,378
No. No. I'll do it.

642
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:04,246
Don't do this.

643
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,673
You saved my life once.

644
01:15:08,458 --> 01:15:09,668
Now I'm gonna save yours.

645
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:13,380
Step aside.

646
01:15:38,875 --> 01:15:40,495
Come on, Tyler. Stop!

647
01:16:00,333 --> 01:16:02,333
What are we doing, man? Huh?

648
01:16:04,166 --> 01:16:05,496
Come on, stay down.

649
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Stay down.

650
01:16:26,208 --> 01:16:27,208
Hey, kid.

651
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:41,881
I know it looks bad. I know it looks bad.

652
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:08,420
I want to go home.

653
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:20,960
I'll get you home, mate.

654
01:18:26,166 --> 01:18:27,246
I'll get you home.

655
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:51,460
 I've got the boy.
I need your help.

656
01:19:21,958 --> 01:19:22,958
Stay here.

657
01:19:57,625 --> 01:19:58,625
Just like that?

658
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:00,710
Yeah, just like that.

659
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:03,710
I want the boy out of here.
That's all I care about.

660
01:20:05,208 --> 01:20:06,208
Why?

661
01:20:07,291 --> 01:20:08,291
'Cause I do.

662
01:20:13,041 --> 01:20:15,881
He was gonna kill my family
if I didn't get his son back.

663
01:20:26,708 --> 01:20:28,517
My people are waiting for him
on the other side

664
01:20:28,541 --> 01:20:29,961
of the Sultana Kamal bridge.

665
01:20:30,666 --> 01:20:32,876
There's two blockades
between here and there.

666
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:34,828
I'll do my best
to draw them away from both.

667
01:20:45,208 --> 01:20:46,748
You get him to the other side.

668
01:20:55,541 --> 01:20:56,541
Tyler.

669
01:21:00,375 --> 01:21:01,375
See you soon, mate.

670
01:21:07,416 --> 01:21:08,456
Let's go.

671
01:21:09,791 --> 01:21:10,791
Come on.

672
01:21:50,958 --> 01:21:51,958
Do you trust him?

673
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:54,625
I do.

674
01:22:04,041 --> 01:22:05,081
Seat belt.

675
01:22:41,791 --> 01:22:43,291
Run fast!

676
01:22:46,375 --> 01:22:47,915
Go, go, go!

677
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:51,960
Oh, sh...

678
01:23:16,333 --> 01:23:18,253
We'll have to go on foot.

679
01:23:45,083 --> 01:23:46,503
Any sign of the boy?

680
01:23:47,083 --> 01:23:48,213
Not yet.

681
01:23:48,833 --> 01:23:50,633
But we've seen our friend...

682
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:52,580
the kid must be near.

683
01:24:08,125 --> 01:24:09,365
Grenade!

684
01:24:31,083 --> 01:24:33,543
We need to go to India.

685
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:36,710
You can't go.
I'm telling you, you can't go.

686
01:24:46,375 --> 01:24:48,495
Hey! You there!

687
01:24:51,625 --> 01:24:56,285
Hey! Hey, stop!
Don't cross the bridge.

688
01:24:58,791 --> 01:25:00,921
Hey! I'm telling you to stop!

689
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,630
Hey, stop!

690
01:25:06,583 --> 01:25:08,503
Take his hat off. Let me see his face.
Huh?

691
01:25:08,583 --> 01:25:09,463
I don't understand.

692
01:25:09,541 --> 01:25:11,581
His hat. Take it off.

693
01:25:17,375 --> 01:25:18,915
Do what he says.

694
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,460
Take off your cap.

695
01:25:40,375 --> 01:25:42,101
Move! Move!
Go, go, go!

696
01:25:42,125 --> 01:25:43,125
Stay here.

697
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:28,590
Take two more units
to the bridge.

698
01:26:30,333 --> 01:26:32,043
Two units to the bridge. Hurry!

699
01:26:33,458 --> 01:26:34,788
Bring me my rifle!

700
01:27:15,541 --> 01:27:19,831
Stay here. Stay down.
I'm gonna draw them away from you.

701
01:27:23,875 --> 01:27:24,875
Go.

702
01:28:35,958 --> 01:28:37,878
Rake, I need you on the bridge!

703
01:28:38,875 --> 01:28:39,955
Yeah, on my way.

704
01:28:41,958 --> 01:28:43,248
Oh, sh...

705
01:30:30,208 --> 01:30:31,078
Where's the kid?

706
01:30:31,166 --> 01:30:33,559
In hiding.
About halfway across the bridge.

707
01:30:33,583 --> 01:30:34,963
I'm trying to clear a path.

708
01:30:39,541 --> 01:30:41,381
Yaz, where are you?

709
01:30:42,083 --> 01:30:43,083
Two minutes out.

710
01:32:57,791 --> 01:33:02,041
Fuck! I'm taking fire.
I'm going... I'm going around.

711
01:36:06,583 --> 01:36:08,003
You see that helicopter?

712
01:36:12,083 --> 01:36:15,713
I need you to run
as fast as you can for it.

713
01:36:16,708 --> 01:36:19,538
No. Please. Please, get up.

714
01:36:31,416 --> 01:36:34,326
Bogeys are down.
LZ clear. Two-minute window.

715
01:36:35,833 --> 01:36:36,833
Go.

716
01:36:37,708 --> 01:36:40,288
Please...
Run.

717
01:36:42,375 --> 01:36:43,375
Run!
