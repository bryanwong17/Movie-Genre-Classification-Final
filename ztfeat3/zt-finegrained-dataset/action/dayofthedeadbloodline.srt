1
00:00:39,703 --> 00:00:42,457
<i>There is no sign of the National Guard.</i>

2
00:00:42,537 --> 00:00:44,780
<i>Creatures are tearing up the city.</i>

3
00:00:47,702 --> 00:00:49,947
<i>Many people eaten alive!</i>

4
00:00:50,938 --> 00:00:52,880
<i>They're coming!</i>

5
00:00:54,636 --> 00:00:56,446
Let's get out of here!

6
00:01:23,903 --> 00:01:26,413
Open the door! Open the door!

7
00:01:42,286 --> 00:01:45,056
Mom? I know. Here, too.

8
00:01:45,136 --> 00:01:48,857
Mom, listen to me, you need to get up
and lock the door to your room, okay?

9
00:01:48,937 --> 00:01:51,090
Don't let anyone in. Not the nurses...

10
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,250
Mom? Mom!

11
00:02:22,536 --> 00:02:25,758
So now we've had time to see
what death looks like.

12
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,524
The question for all of you is...

13
00:02:29,103 --> 00:02:30,947
...how did he die?

14
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:37,023
Now remember, the patient
first complained of a sore throat...

15
00:02:37,103 --> 00:02:40,224
...a fever and a cough.

16
00:02:41,003 --> 00:02:45,802
Considering these factors,
can you find this man's cause of death?

17
00:02:55,236 --> 00:02:59,491
So, any of you got a theory on C.O.D.
based off this information?

18
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,979
Syphilis?

19
00:03:03,736 --> 00:03:07,124
Nice try, Abby, but I don't think
syphilis infects the lungs.

20
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:09,714
Peter.

21
00:03:11,202 --> 00:03:12,783
Suzie?

22
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:22,924
Influenza.

23
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:27,456
Correct. Now, what strain is it, Zoe?

24
00:03:27,536 --> 00:03:30,143
It has to be H1N5.

25
00:03:30,223 --> 00:03:32,323
Close. H1N1.

26
00:03:32,403 --> 00:03:34,143
Note the collapsed air sacs.

27
00:03:34,223 --> 00:03:37,891
They couldn't inflate,
so they couldn't provide oxygen.

28
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,847
That's what killed him.

29
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,380
Oh, don't worry, Zoe.
You're not being graded today.

30
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:56,377
Hey, doc.

31
00:03:56,457 --> 00:03:59,357
Any chance you wanna come
to the end of the semester's fiesta?

32
00:03:59,437 --> 00:04:02,090
What, and go drinking with my students?

33
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,824
Think I'll pass. Have fun.

34
00:04:05,403 --> 00:04:07,956
- You're coming, right?
- No, you go ahead.

35
00:04:08,036 --> 00:04:09,677
I have some tests to finish up first.

36
00:04:09,757 --> 00:04:13,624
Hey, don't beat yourself up. I know
you can be obsessed about these things.

37
00:04:13,704 --> 00:04:17,766
I know. I just...
can't believe I didn't see it.

38
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,313
- Okay, call me.
- I will.

39
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:46,690
Sorry to bother you, Zoe.

40
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,350
Your regular just came in
to give his weekly blood sample.

41
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,724
Can Abby help? He makes me uncomfortable.

42
00:04:52,804 --> 00:04:56,057
I know he's a bit strange,
but the antibodies in his blood...

43
00:04:56,137 --> 00:04:58,467
...are a hundred times normal level.

44
00:04:58,547 --> 00:05:01,190
It's unlike anything we've ever seen before.

45
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,879
Trust me, Zoe, this is a great
opportunity for you.

46
00:05:26,236 --> 00:05:29,313
- Hi, Zoe.
- Hi, Max.

47
00:05:29,869 --> 00:05:33,146
- It's good to see you again.
- Your arm.

48
00:05:35,352 --> 00:05:38,429
- Anything for you.
- Please roll up your sleeve.

49
00:05:40,536 --> 00:05:42,346
Of course.

50
00:05:51,929 --> 00:05:53,524
So...

51
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:57,741
...have you thought about
what I asked last time?

52
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,980
I told you, not interested, Max.

53
00:06:04,436 --> 00:06:06,912
You know, I'm never gonna give up.

54
00:06:07,336 --> 00:06:09,413
You really should give me a chance.

55
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,513
Make a fist.

56
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:18,853
Relax.

57
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:24,380
Like a vampire.

58
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:27,846
Sucking me dry.

59
00:06:35,502 --> 00:06:38,380
Zoe, thank you for being so gentle.

60
00:06:39,236 --> 00:06:41,162
Your other arm.

61
00:06:56,553 --> 00:06:59,110
- What is that?
- You like it?

62
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:04,657
- This has to stop!
- Is there a problem in here, Zoe?

63
00:07:04,736 --> 00:07:08,217
No. I'm just giving my weekly sample.

64
00:07:08,297 --> 00:07:11,379
Get out of here, you creepy old fuck!

65
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,513
Zoe.

66
00:07:18,835 --> 00:07:21,691
This guy is crazy. He won't leave me alone.

67
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,613
You can't let people do that to you, Zoe.
Be stronger next time.

68
00:07:27,402 --> 00:07:29,647
Come on. The party's waiting.

69
00:07:35,636 --> 00:07:37,053
Chug! Chug! Chug!

70
00:07:37,133 --> 00:07:38,647
Yeah!

71
00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:49,657
Doctor's orders. Mingle. Drink.

72
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:52,123
You know me, social gatherings.

73
00:07:52,203 --> 00:07:54,490
We see these people every day, Zoe.

74
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,624
Hey, babe, where you been?

75
00:07:56,703 --> 00:07:59,323
Trying to get the shy one out of her shell.

76
00:07:59,403 --> 00:08:01,956
- Let's grab a beer.
- We tapped the first keg already.

77
00:08:02,036 --> 00:08:04,823
But we got two more chilling in the morgue.
Can one of you help me?

78
00:08:04,903 --> 00:08:08,745
I got it. I'll socialize after, I swear.

79
00:08:20,753 --> 00:08:22,329
Peter?

80
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,480
Peter, where are you?

81
00:08:39,337 --> 00:08:41,550
- You're an asshole!
- Come on.

82
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:44,023
You know every one of us
has wanted to do that.

83
00:08:44,103 --> 00:08:46,567
No, just idiots like you.

84
00:08:47,603 --> 00:08:50,773
Sorry. I'm a dick, I know this.

85
00:08:50,853 --> 00:08:53,460
Now, can we please go get drunk?

86
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:56,812
Just don't ever do that to me again.

87
00:09:19,229 --> 00:09:20,679
Max.

88
00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:23,246
What are you doing down here?

89
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:27,046
Relax, Zoe.

90
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:29,857
I just wanna talk.

91
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,610
There's nothing for us to talk about.

92
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:36,152
See... we are connected.

93
00:09:36,803 --> 00:09:40,279
- There is no "we," Max.
- We're meant...

94
00:09:40,969 --> 00:09:43,456
- ...to be together!
- Let go of me!

95
00:09:43,536 --> 00:09:44,842
Peter!

96
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:49,589
- Give me a chance.
- No! No! Get off me!

97
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:51,555
Help me!

98
00:09:57,336 --> 00:09:59,850
Somebody help me!

99
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,090
I like it when you fight.

100
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,013
You are mine.

101
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,446
Zoe! Zoe!

102
00:10:29,602 --> 00:10:31,556
Zoe!

103
00:10:31,636 --> 00:10:34,566
Zoe! Help!

104
00:10:37,286 --> 00:10:39,323
Everybody, we have to get
the fuck out of here!

105
00:10:39,403 --> 00:10:41,023
- What?
- Now! He's awake!

106
00:10:41,103 --> 00:10:42,556
Zoe, what's going on?

107
00:10:42,636 --> 00:10:46,431
Please move! Why the hell
aren't you moving? Come on!

108
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,545
Dr. Beeman, are you okay?

109
00:10:52,982 --> 00:10:55,674
- Peter, no! Get away from her!
- Peter!

110
00:11:04,136 --> 00:11:06,212
Abby, come on! Come on!

111
00:11:21,337 --> 00:11:24,222
Zoe! Come on, help me up there!

112
00:11:24,302 --> 00:11:26,779
- Help!
- Abby, no!

113
00:11:29,802 --> 00:11:32,186
Abby! Abby!

114
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,246
Abby!

115
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:57,090
<i>It's been five years
since the first outbreak.</i>

116
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,522
<i>When reports came out
from around the world...</i>

117
00:11:59,602 --> 00:12:04,456
<i>...about the virus becoming an international
emergency, it was too late.</i>

118
00:12:04,536 --> 00:12:06,656
<i>Few of us survived.</i>

119
00:12:06,736 --> 00:12:09,546
<i>The rest became rotters.</i>

120
00:12:12,702 --> 00:12:17,090
<i>I was one of the lucky ones to have made it
to one of the refugee camps in time...</i>

121
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,057
<i>...only to be assigned to High Rock Bunker...</i>

122
00:12:20,736 --> 00:12:23,323
<i>...an intelligence
and recon military station...</i>

123
00:12:23,402 --> 00:12:26,412
<i>...to gather data of rotters for CDC.</i>

124
00:12:27,469 --> 00:12:29,290
<i>Problem is...</i>

125
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,246
<i>...it's been a year
since we've heard from HQ.</i>

126
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:36,223
<i>And probably forever...</i>

127
00:12:36,303 --> 00:12:38,346
<i>...since we saw a survivor.</i>

128
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:42,690
<i>So this is our home now...</i>

129
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:46,456
<i>...part military base, part refugee camp.</i>

130
00:12:47,036 --> 00:12:51,124
<i>You make do with what you have,
scavenge what's left of life.</i>

131
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:53,522
<i>After all...</i>

132
00:12:53,602 --> 00:12:56,293
<i>...this is going to be our home
for a little while.</i>

133
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,358
<i>...please report to station four right now.</i>

134
00:13:03,136 --> 00:13:07,190
- Morning, Shannon. How are your headaches?
- Much better. Thank you, Zoe.

135
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,456
You little devil,
better let your mom sleep tonight.

136
00:13:11,735 --> 00:13:14,856
<i>Curfew announcement.
Today's lockdown will occur at 1600...</i>

137
00:13:14,936 --> 00:13:18,157
- Obeying the speed limit, Jeremy?
- Never.

138
00:13:18,237 --> 00:13:21,123
Hey, doc, you gonna hit the shower
after your morning jog?

139
00:13:21,203 --> 00:13:23,923
- Let me know if you need a hand.
- Easy up, Alphonse. She's taken.

140
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,622
She knows I'm only joking, Lucy.

141
00:13:25,702 --> 00:13:28,190
I'm just keeping myself fresh
till the right girl comes along.

142
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:32,690
- You might be waiting a while.
- That's cold, doc. Real cold.

143
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,612
Come on, Alphonse.

144
00:13:36,368 --> 00:13:40,690
Do you think the lieutenant is right
and we're just wasting our time here?

145
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:43,456
Maybe God doesn't want us
to reverse what happened.

146
00:13:43,536 --> 00:13:47,423
Doesn't matter that Miguel thinks.
We have a job to do.

147
00:13:48,303 --> 00:13:50,179
Got your back.

148
00:13:58,368 --> 00:14:00,789
Elyse, can you pass me
rotter sample number eight?

149
00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:02,678
Sure thing.

150
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:08,859
Here you go.

151
00:14:10,236 --> 00:14:12,091
I remember this one.

152
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:16,177
Guy had a nasty set
of bite marks on his hands.

153
00:14:16,257 --> 00:14:18,323
What do you think happened to him?

154
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:21,612
I'd say he had his hands
down the wrong girl's pants.

155
00:14:25,301 --> 00:14:26,812
Zoe?

156
00:14:27,635 --> 00:14:29,563
Lily's fever shot up.

157
00:14:29,643 --> 00:14:31,923
The medicine you gave her didn't work.

158
00:14:32,402 --> 00:14:34,246
Meet me in the med ward.

159
00:14:46,435 --> 00:14:48,589
Where does it hurt, sweetie?

160
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:50,191
Everywhere.

161
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,706
You're such a brave little girl.

162
00:14:54,335 --> 00:14:56,456
Just close your eyes and rest.

163
00:14:56,536 --> 00:14:58,979
I'll try and make you feel better, okay?

164
00:15:05,468 --> 00:15:09,136
As long as Jeff can promise a heavy crop,
we'll make it through winter.

165
00:15:09,216 --> 00:15:11,923
I'll see what I can do.
Let's just hope mother nature cooperates.

166
00:15:12,003 --> 00:15:13,596
Any other pressing issues?

167
00:15:13,676 --> 00:15:17,822
Yeah, we found more rats in the warehouse,
but Steve's taking care of it.

168
00:15:17,902 --> 00:15:20,512
I've noticed a lot of sloppiness as of late.

169
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:24,623
We're at war, people. One error can
ruin all the work we've done here.

170
00:15:24,703 --> 00:15:28,057
I won't tolerate any mistakes.
Zoe, you're late.

171
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:30,612
I'm sorry for interrupting, but it's serious.

172
00:15:33,068 --> 00:15:35,675
- What is it?
- The antibiotics I used on Lily aren't working.

173
00:15:35,755 --> 00:15:39,090
She's worse.
I believe it's bacterial pneumonia...

174
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,489
...which is highly contagious.
I've quarantined her for now, but still...

175
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:44,590
You're the town doctor. You're
telling me there's nothing you can do.

176
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:48,389
I don't have the antibiotics
to properly treat what Lily has.

177
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:49,956
We need to go on a supply run.

178
00:15:50,036 --> 00:15:52,970
We've already ransacked every place
within the designated range...

179
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,656
...for your bullshit rotter research.

180
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:58,523
Then we need to go past our
usual search distance. Be bolder.

181
00:15:58,603 --> 00:16:01,623
I was a med student
at Whittendale University.

182
00:16:02,103 --> 00:16:05,523
The medical supply cache
was secured inside a locked vault.

183
00:16:06,402 --> 00:16:09,623
- I know the code.
- No. It's too far.

184
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:12,763
I know it's far, but it is worth the risk.

185
00:16:12,843 --> 00:16:16,456
We would have enough medication to save Lily
and to stop her illness from spreading.

186
00:16:16,536 --> 00:16:18,265
Or we keep Lily isolated.

187
00:16:20,035 --> 00:16:22,473
Keeping her isolated will not help.

188
00:16:23,003 --> 00:16:25,589
Her sickness will spread inside this bunker.

189
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:27,489
Many of us will die.

190
00:16:28,168 --> 00:16:30,445
It is a medical certainty.

191
00:16:36,168 --> 00:16:40,643
Okay. My brother Baca,
is gonna lead your little field trip.

192
00:16:40,723 --> 00:16:43,880
You leave tomorrow at dawn, and you
come right back. No sightseeing...

193
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,689
...no side tracks. Are we absolutely clear?

194
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:48,578
Yes, sir.

195
00:17:08,368 --> 00:17:10,178
It's gonna be okay.

196
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,179
I missed you.

197
00:17:52,401 --> 00:17:56,222
- <i>No!</i>
- <i>You are mine.</i>

198
00:17:56,302 --> 00:17:58,545
<i>Somebody help me!</i>

199
00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:03,590
What's wrong?

200
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,545
Nothing.

201
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:09,178
What does that mean?

202
00:18:10,251 --> 00:18:12,095
I have to go out.

203
00:18:13,568 --> 00:18:16,322
Really? We talked about this last time.

204
00:18:16,402 --> 00:18:18,676
I just... I have a lot on my mind.

205
00:18:18,756 --> 00:18:20,579
What, and us?

206
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:24,623
That's not important? I love you, Zoe.

207
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:27,357
Look, I care about you.

208
00:18:28,236 --> 00:18:30,189
I do, but...

209
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:32,746
...I need to go and check on Lily right now.

210
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:04,656
Hey, Zoe.

211
00:19:04,736 --> 00:19:06,612
Hey, sweetie.

212
00:19:08,235 --> 00:19:12,289
Tomorrow morning, I'm going outside to
try and find something to make you better.

213
00:19:12,869 --> 00:19:15,823
But there are rotters out there.

214
00:19:15,903 --> 00:19:17,790
No, it's okay.

215
00:19:18,569 --> 00:19:20,445
They don't scare me.

216
00:19:20,935 --> 00:19:22,757
Do me a favor.

217
00:19:23,836 --> 00:19:26,176
Will you hold on to this
for me while I'm gone?

218
00:19:26,256 --> 00:19:28,112
It was my mom's.

219
00:19:30,451 --> 00:19:33,106
It used to protect me
when I was a little girl.

220
00:19:33,936 --> 00:19:35,823
Now, it'll do the same for you.

221
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:38,322
Thank you.

222
00:19:38,602 --> 00:19:40,445
Good night, sweetie.

223
00:19:41,869 --> 00:19:43,712
Good night.

224
00:19:58,836 --> 00:20:00,756
<i>Attention all civilians.</i>

225
00:20:00,836 --> 00:20:04,489
<i>Main team ready to leave
in t-minus three minutes.</i>

226
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:07,356
- <i>Protocol...</i>
- I'll be back before you know it.

227
00:20:07,436 --> 00:20:11,111
<i>All civilians are to clear
perimeter in their zones.</i>

228
00:20:14,135 --> 00:20:17,546
<i>I repeat, clear perimeter in all zones.</i>

229
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:22,955
I'm sorry about last night. I didn't...

230
00:20:23,035 --> 00:20:25,280
No, I shouldn't have reacted that way.

231
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:30,429
Let's go get Lily her meds.

232
00:21:14,552 --> 00:21:16,172
<i>Team Two, how's your status?</i>

233
00:21:16,252 --> 00:21:19,129
<i>East side perimeter clear. Nothing here.</i>

234
00:21:22,068 --> 00:21:23,878
I used to do this as a kid.

235
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:28,612
What?

236
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:32,178
You just never talked
about your childhood before.

237
00:21:34,701 --> 00:21:37,757
Your mom? Your dad?

238
00:21:38,236 --> 00:21:40,112
There isn't much to talk about.

239
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:44,144
How about you?

240
00:21:44,601 --> 00:21:46,457
My dad was an army man.

241
00:21:47,236 --> 00:21:49,111
Never smiled.

242
00:21:50,235 --> 00:21:52,657
Except when he took Miguel and I hunting.

243
00:21:53,736 --> 00:21:55,790
Hard to believe you two are brothers.

244
00:21:56,369 --> 00:22:00,045
- You're so different.
- Miguel's always been the way he is.

245
00:22:01,201 --> 00:22:02,855
Always...

246
00:22:02,935 --> 00:22:04,989
...wanted to be the superior one.

247
00:22:05,968 --> 00:22:07,978
Always wanted to control things.

248
00:22:09,901 --> 00:22:11,779
Like my dad.

249
00:22:18,635 --> 00:22:23,142
You know what I miss, man?
A nice, greasy cheeseburger with fries.

250
00:22:23,222 --> 00:22:26,470
I'd have to go with Deep Dish
Pizza, Chicago style.

251
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,389
Solid. What about you, Elyse?

252
00:22:30,068 --> 00:22:33,145
I miss Maggie's Place.

253
00:22:34,101 --> 00:22:37,189
It was a diner in Wichita
my mom used to take me to.

254
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:39,849
Best damn apple pie you ever tasted.

255
00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:43,589
Nice. Frank, what do you miss, man?

256
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:45,922
Ice cream sundaes? Chicken nuggets?

257
00:22:46,002 --> 00:22:48,212
I miss people shutting the fuck up.

258
00:22:59,386 --> 00:23:02,789
<i>Fuck! Something's wrong. Everybody pull over.</i>

259
00:23:03,069 --> 00:23:05,944
<i>All right, people. Look sharp. Stay focused.</i>

260
00:23:14,368 --> 00:23:16,245
Set up a perimeter!

261
00:23:17,201 --> 00:23:20,889
This is a bad spot. We won't see
any rotters until they're on us.

262
00:23:20,969 --> 00:23:22,979
It's not like we had any say
where we broke down.

263
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:25,189
You guys wanna keep it down
and watch your six.

264
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:27,111
Talk to me, Lucy.

265
00:23:29,188 --> 00:23:31,322
- Come on!
- Fucking radiator again.

266
00:23:31,402 --> 00:23:35,236
- Savin said it was good to go.
- All right. Well, how long to fix it?

267
00:23:35,536 --> 00:23:39,022
Not sure. The coolant isn't
getting to the engine block.

268
00:23:39,102 --> 00:23:40,722
The lieutenant's gonna be
pissed if we show up late!

269
00:23:40,802 --> 00:23:42,656
Yeah, I'm aware.

270
00:23:42,735 --> 00:23:45,553
All right, well, come on, Lucy.
We don't have much time until nightfall.

271
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,389
I know.

272
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:51,089
All right, you heard the man.
First team, secure west perimeter.

273
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:52,892
Second team, take the east.

274
00:24:19,435 --> 00:24:21,290
This is taking too long.

275
00:24:21,973 --> 00:24:25,854
We should turn around.
We can come back in a few days.

276
00:24:26,928 --> 00:24:29,259
- Lily can't wait a few days.
- I'm sorry.

277
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:32,249
I just don't see the math
in risking eight lives for one!

278
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:36,055
- Sick kid or not.
- Let me put it this way.

279
00:24:36,135 --> 00:24:38,022
What if Lily was your kid?

280
00:24:38,402 --> 00:24:40,212
Your sick one in the bunker?

281
00:24:41,301 --> 00:24:43,978
Because if we don't succeed, it could be.

282
00:24:45,635 --> 00:24:47,111
Fuck!

283
00:24:48,001 --> 00:24:50,612
Rotters! Everybody in position!

284
00:24:51,768 --> 00:24:53,729
- Lucy!
- Almost there.

285
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:55,578
Give me one more minute.

286
00:24:56,792 --> 00:25:01,012
- Sounds like a swarm!
- Lucy, come on, we gotta go! Hurry up!

287
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:05,356
- Yes! I got it!
- Everyone back to the vehicles, now!

288
00:25:05,436 --> 00:25:08,091
Move, move, move, move!

289
00:25:08,901 --> 00:25:10,308
Go, go!

290
00:25:12,768 --> 00:25:15,549
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on, come on, go!

291
00:25:15,628 --> 00:25:17,599
- Go!
- Now!

292
00:25:38,634 --> 00:25:41,539
<i>Team Two, give me a status report.</i>

293
00:25:41,618 --> 00:25:43,105
<i>All clear.</i>

294
00:25:43,185 --> 00:25:45,440
<i>Looks like we lost them. Over.</i>

295
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:49,106
<i>Copy. Casualty report? Over.</i>

296
00:25:49,186 --> 00:25:53,456
<i>No casualties. Looks like
we dodged a big one. Over.</i>

297
00:25:53,536 --> 00:25:55,655
<i>And not a moment too soon.</i>

298
00:25:55,735 --> 00:25:57,578
<i>We're here, guys.</i>

299
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:13,145
Lucy, Derek, Thomas, you stay here.
Everyone else on me.

300
00:26:18,001 --> 00:26:19,912
Alphonse, go!

301
00:26:26,034 --> 00:26:28,265
Right, then the first left.

302
00:26:34,101 --> 00:26:36,945
Straight ahead. Take a left at the end.

303
00:27:15,728 --> 00:27:17,245
Clear.

304
00:27:17,901 --> 00:27:19,778
Let's move.

305
00:27:36,468 --> 00:27:37,978
Go!

306
00:27:54,068 --> 00:27:56,232
Here. This one on the left.

307
00:28:09,868 --> 00:28:11,412
Clear.

308
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:16,845
These are vaccines, these are
antibiotics. Grab those first.

309
00:28:30,134 --> 00:28:34,055
- Lucy, what's your sit-rep?
- <i>All clear out here. Over.</i>

310
00:28:34,135 --> 00:28:37,211
- Copy that. Stay put. We'll be out in five.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

311
00:28:40,168 --> 00:28:42,212
All right, we got it. Let's go.

312
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,399
All right, people, we gotta move.

313
00:30:37,201 --> 00:30:38,622
- Where's Zoe?
- I don't know.

314
00:30:38,702 --> 00:30:41,259
- Shots came from the south wing.
- Go, go!

315
00:31:17,467 --> 00:31:20,469
Jesus, Zoe.
What the hell happened? Are you okay?

316
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:23,778
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- We need to move now.

317
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,932
Rotters are coming! Move!

318
00:31:28,012 --> 00:31:29,645
Go!

319
00:31:36,684 --> 00:31:38,564
I don't have a clear shot!

320
00:31:39,801 --> 00:31:41,522
God!

321
00:31:41,642 --> 00:31:43,705
Come on, Frank, let's go!

322
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:46,759
- Dear God, he's infected!
- Go!

323
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:48,659
Get out of here! Go!

324
00:31:52,001 --> 00:31:53,811
We gotta move.

325
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:08,844
Go! Now! Move, move!

326
00:32:10,968 --> 00:32:12,844
Baca, where's Frank?

327
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,278
He's gone! Get in!

328
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:19,245
Let's go! Move, move, move!

329
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:03,845
Go check the Humvees.

330
00:33:06,001 --> 00:33:08,099
You're way fucking late, Baca.

331
00:33:08,178 --> 00:33:10,845
We ran into some car trouble.

332
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:15,889
And we lost Frank, too. He's dead.

333
00:33:15,969 --> 00:33:19,268
This is why we don't go on wild
fucking goose chase supply runs.

334
00:33:19,348 --> 00:33:21,522
- So people don't die for nothing.
- It wasn't for nothing!

335
00:33:21,602 --> 00:33:23,471
We got the meds, Miguel.

336
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:27,175
It's "Lieutenant." And you should've aborted
the minute you had vehicle problems.

337
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,544
We needed to get the supplies.

338
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,961
Where's Frank?

339
00:33:34,134 --> 00:33:36,012
Why don't you tell her, Zoe?

340
00:33:41,934 --> 00:33:43,778
I'm so sorry, Elle.

341
00:33:46,101 --> 00:33:47,912
This is all on you!

342
00:33:49,034 --> 00:33:51,244
It was your idea to go out there!

343
00:34:37,468 --> 00:34:38,942
Hey, wait up!

344
00:34:39,022 --> 00:34:41,689
<i>All residents return to the bunker now.</i>

345
00:34:41,769 --> 00:34:44,645
<i>All residents return to the bunker now.</i>

346
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:51,811
<i>All residents return to the bunker.</i>

347
00:34:52,802 --> 00:34:55,979
<i>All residents return to bunker now.</i>

348
00:35:05,367 --> 00:35:08,859
- You didn't hear the shift buzzer?
- I wanna look for my ball.

349
00:35:09,368 --> 00:35:11,411
I'll find it. You go inside.

350
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:28,929
<i>Main gate now closing.</i>

351
00:35:34,901 --> 00:35:36,789
Sorry, thought I checked it.

352
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,975
Sorry's not gonna cut it
when there's rotters up your ass.

353
00:36:15,034 --> 00:36:16,878
We got it.

354
00:36:19,834 --> 00:36:21,788
Hey, sweetie.

355
00:36:21,868 --> 00:36:23,388
You came back.

356
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:26,244
A promise is a promise.

357
00:36:30,634 --> 00:36:34,650
This may taste a little gross,
but you're a brave one, right?

358
00:36:39,234 --> 00:36:41,111
Just a little more.

359
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:42,778
Good girl.

360
00:36:49,734 --> 00:36:51,311
Zoe.

361
00:36:51,868 --> 00:36:53,678
Thank you.

362
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,355
Thank you so much.

363
00:36:57,435 --> 00:36:59,244
You're welcome.

364
00:37:12,267 --> 00:37:13,844
Hey.

365
00:38:29,967 --> 00:38:31,588
This is High Rock emergency bunker.

366
00:38:31,668 --> 00:38:35,278
If anyone can hear this message,
please respond on this frequency.

367
00:38:38,001 --> 00:38:39,609
This is High Rock emergency bunker.

368
00:38:39,689 --> 00:38:43,144
If anyone can hear this message,
please respond on this frequency.

369
00:38:45,534 --> 00:38:49,211
This is High Rock emergency bunker.
If anyone can hear this message...

370
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,177
You wanted to see me?

371
00:38:53,334 --> 00:38:55,210
Leave the room.

372
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:09,887
I asked you here because I think you and I
have had somewhat of a misunderstanding.

373
00:39:09,967 --> 00:39:11,594
Misunderstanding?

374
00:39:17,534 --> 00:39:20,555
Don't you ever talk back to me
like that again in front of the others.

375
00:39:20,635 --> 00:39:24,883
I'm in charge here. My job is to keep the
people safe, and I decide how that's done.

376
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:26,478
Understood?

377
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,422
Yes...

378
00:39:29,702 --> 00:39:31,354
...Lieutenant.

379
00:39:31,434 --> 00:39:33,397
You're dismissed.

380
00:40:40,767 --> 00:40:42,642
Zoe, wait up.

381
00:40:43,301 --> 00:40:45,188
What did Miguel want?

382
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,288
Why don't you ask him, Baca?
He's your brother.

383
00:40:48,368 --> 00:40:50,411
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

384
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,021
Miguel shouldn't have blamed you
for Frank, all right?

385
00:40:55,101 --> 00:40:58,988
That's not on you. Frank knew
the risks we all take going outside.

386
00:40:59,068 --> 00:41:02,943
What's important is that you saved
Lily and everyone else here.

387
00:41:03,635 --> 00:41:05,478
We're all thankful for it.

388
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,511
Thank you.

389
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:20,877
I should get back to work.

390
00:41:31,067 --> 00:41:33,111
Fucking rats!

391
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,854
<i>Please make sure ration cards are stamped...</i>

392
00:42:08,934 --> 00:42:11,221
I was at the game. I'm telling you...

393
00:42:11,301 --> 00:42:14,754
...your pitchers couldn't throw
a fastball to save their lives.

394
00:42:14,834 --> 00:42:17,954
You need a strong bullpen
to have a good baseball team.

395
00:42:18,034 --> 00:42:21,488
I don't care what you say.
The Yankees were the best ever, man.

396
00:42:21,568 --> 00:42:24,055
If it weren't for the rotters, hell,
we would've won the last season.

397
00:42:24,135 --> 00:42:27,641
Yeah, keep telling yourself that.
My Rangers would've swept your guys.

398
00:42:27,721 --> 00:42:31,255
- High Rock's finest.
- Compliments of the chef.

399
00:42:31,335 --> 00:42:35,429
<i>...are stamped by a station officer
before proceeding to line.</i>

400
00:42:35,509 --> 00:42:38,342
What the fuck is with this line, Jeff?
People got work details.

401
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:40,754
Sorry, I got off
to a late start this morning.

402
00:42:40,834 --> 00:42:44,689
Steve was supposed to come in and fix the
broken stove, but he hasn't shown up yet.

403
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:48,088
Wendy, go talk to your boyfriend.

404
00:42:48,168 --> 00:42:50,954
Tell him to come up here
and fix this stove immediately.

405
00:42:51,034 --> 00:42:52,843
Yes, sir.

406
00:42:56,566 --> 00:42:58,411
Move it faster.

407
00:43:02,501 --> 00:43:04,044
Stevie?

408
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,977
Where are you, honey?

409
00:43:10,633 --> 00:43:12,677
You're needed in the mess hall.

410
00:43:15,167 --> 00:43:16,743
Sweetie?

411
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:19,961
Miguel's pissed.

412
00:43:54,001 --> 00:43:56,724
Help! Help!

413
00:43:56,804 --> 00:43:59,261
Help! Help!

414
00:44:01,967 --> 00:44:04,587
Hey, Lily. Jeremy.

415
00:44:04,667 --> 00:44:07,088
- Hi, Zoe.
- It's past Lily's bedtime.

416
00:44:07,168 --> 00:44:09,010
She needs rest.

417
00:44:10,067 --> 00:44:12,077
You can come back tomorrow, okay?

418
00:44:13,267 --> 00:44:15,455
- Bye, Lily.
- Bye.

419
00:44:15,534 --> 00:44:18,577
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey.

420
00:44:21,532 --> 00:44:23,608
I wanted to give you this back.

421
00:44:23,688 --> 00:44:26,767
Oh, keep it. Looks better on you.

422
00:44:34,499 --> 00:44:35,925
Now go to sleep.

423
00:44:36,005 --> 00:44:38,688
Not before my mom comes to say good night.

424
00:44:39,667 --> 00:44:41,677
She'll be by after her work shift.

425
00:44:44,467 --> 00:44:46,604
- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night.

426
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,111
Sweet dreams.

427
00:45:19,301 --> 00:45:23,681
<i>Code red. Intruder alert.
Code red. Intruder alert.</i>

428
00:45:23,761 --> 00:45:27,454
Alarm in the medical wing.
I repeat, alarm in the medical wing. Go!

429
00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:29,810
Go, go, go!

430
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,811
Go!

431
00:45:37,566 --> 00:45:39,391
Come on! No, no, no!

432
00:46:04,667 --> 00:46:06,222
Max?

433
00:46:06,628 --> 00:46:09,477
You recognize me? How are you still alive?

434
00:46:19,334 --> 00:46:20,506
Zoe!

435
00:46:22,633 --> 00:46:25,587
- Don't kill him! He's not a rotter!
- Zoe, get out of the fucking way!

436
00:46:25,667 --> 00:46:29,348
- Trust me! We need to catch him alive!
- Bullshit! He's one of them!

437
00:46:29,427 --> 00:46:33,618
No! He's not! His name is Max!
He's a patient of mine!

438
00:46:33,698 --> 00:46:37,493
Baca, he's the breakthrough
I've been searching for!

439
00:46:49,067 --> 00:46:51,278
We got you now, motherfucker!

440
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,588
What the hell? Are you all fucking crazy?

441
00:46:58,678 --> 00:47:02,098
- Why didn't you kill it?
- Wait. He's alive.

442
00:47:02,467 --> 00:47:04,710
I need him for my research.

443
00:47:05,034 --> 00:47:06,854
Looks like a rotter to me.

444
00:47:06,934 --> 00:47:08,551
Yes.

445
00:47:08,631 --> 00:47:11,055
But we all know that rotters always bite.

446
00:47:11,934 --> 00:47:14,543
He had the chance to bite me
before, and he didn't.

447
00:47:15,633 --> 00:47:17,443
Prove it.

448
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:23,844
Zoe, you don't have to do that.

449
00:47:56,167 --> 00:47:57,609
See?

450
00:47:58,733 --> 00:48:01,020
It means his brain is still working.

451
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:04,088
He got the bite, but something
in his body stopped him from turning.

452
00:48:04,367 --> 00:48:06,681
He could be the breakthrough we need
in beating the rotter virus.

453
00:48:06,761 --> 00:48:08,428
You can't cure being a rotter.

454
00:48:08,508 --> 00:48:10,814
I'm not talking about a cure
for being a rotter.

455
00:48:10,894 --> 00:48:13,421
I'm talking about a vaccine
for the rest of us.

456
00:48:13,591 --> 00:48:15,641
A bite would no longer be a death sentence.

457
00:48:17,533 --> 00:48:19,077
Please.

458
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:23,852
- Just give me a chance.
- This is all a bunch of bullshit. Shoot it.

459
00:48:23,932 --> 00:48:27,488
Miguel, wait! If there's
a chance Zoe can do it.

460
00:48:27,768 --> 00:48:29,643
We should let her try.

461
00:48:30,733 --> 00:48:32,554
This vaccine...

462
00:48:32,634 --> 00:48:34,277
...could've saved Frank.

463
00:48:40,467 --> 00:48:42,488
Fine. Do your tests.

464
00:48:42,868 --> 00:48:44,854
I want it locked up at all times.

465
00:48:44,934 --> 00:48:46,776
If there are any issues...

466
00:48:47,283 --> 00:48:49,161
...put it the fuck down.

467
00:48:49,967 --> 00:48:51,810
Yes, sir.

468
00:48:55,134 --> 00:48:59,521
<i>Only 12 hours since Max has been restrained
and placed under observation...</i>

is divided up on their opinions...</i>

<i>...on what we should do with him.</i>

471
00:49:05,533 --> 00:49:09,855
<i>Miguel is looking for any excuse
he can find to put him down.</i>

472
00:49:09,935 --> 00:49:13,421
<i>With our current specimens
of rotters' blood running low...</i>

473
00:49:13,501 --> 00:49:17,521
<i>...I need to acquire additional samples
to buy myself more time...</i>

474
00:49:17,601 --> 00:49:20,610
<i>...to find scientific proof Max is different.</i>

475
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:23,277
<i>Max's vitals!</i>

476
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,977
Look at this. It's incredible.

477
00:49:32,617 --> 00:49:35,371
Certain internal
and external parts are dead...

478
00:49:35,451 --> 00:49:38,304
...while other parts
are still very much alive.

479
00:49:38,834 --> 00:49:42,304
His heart, his eyes, legs,
and his cranial area...

480
00:49:42,384 --> 00:49:44,804
...all still retaining human function.

481
00:49:44,884 --> 00:49:47,760
- Any clue as to why?
- No, not yet.

482
00:49:51,149 --> 00:49:53,190
But I need to take his blood sample.

483
00:49:55,253 --> 00:49:59,693
We're breaking protocol here, Zoe.
He makes one wrong move, I'm shooting him.

484
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:03,593
Just relax, Max.

485
00:50:06,216 --> 00:50:08,061
You want me, right?

486
00:50:10,416 --> 00:50:12,226
Here I am.

487
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:17,360
Your Zoe.

488
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:20,293
That's right.

489
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:25,343
I know you came all this way just for me.

490
00:50:39,149 --> 00:50:40,994
You like feeling my touch?

491
00:50:45,716 --> 00:50:49,438
Hey! I'm gonna blow
your head off, you piece of shit!

492
00:50:49,518 --> 00:50:51,905
No, don't, Elyse.

493
00:50:51,985 --> 00:50:53,827
I'm fine.

494
00:50:57,687 --> 00:50:59,193
Zoe.

495
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:35,500
Hey.

496
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:42,420
So what have you found?

497
00:51:42,951 --> 00:51:46,868
Based on the blood sample I took,
his hormone levels are off the chart.

498
00:51:47,317 --> 00:51:49,371
I have never seen anything like it.

499
00:51:49,751 --> 00:51:52,104
So you think that's what stopped the virus?

500
00:51:52,584 --> 00:51:54,338
Well, possibly.

501
00:51:54,418 --> 00:51:57,387
But there are nine hormonal glands,
and I don't know which one it is.

502
00:51:57,467 --> 00:52:01,972
If I can find the source, I might be able
to extract it to produce a testable vaccine.

503
00:52:02,851 --> 00:52:05,304
Okay. All right, so what do you need?

504
00:52:06,383 --> 00:52:09,393
I need live virus samples
from living rotters.

505
00:52:10,417 --> 00:52:13,237
Look, maybe we can round some up
from outside to bring in for tests.

506
00:52:13,317 --> 00:52:15,438
No! Absolutely not.

507
00:52:15,518 --> 00:52:18,571
I mean, you know how much I've
risked letting that thing stay here?

508
00:52:18,651 --> 00:52:21,671
Look, I need the live samples
to compare to Max's.

509
00:52:21,751 --> 00:52:24,304
It is the only way to know
which hormone it is.

510
00:52:25,283 --> 00:52:27,682
Please, Baca, there must be a safer way.

511
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,538
The perimeter gate.

512
00:52:36,317 --> 00:52:40,554
We can use the doors to file them in
one by one in a contained setting.

513
00:52:40,634 --> 00:52:43,126
Okay. When can we do it?

514
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:45,974
Tonight.

515
00:52:49,216 --> 00:52:53,204
<i>Main gate is now opening.
Nine-A, prepare to initiate.</i>

516
00:52:53,284 --> 00:52:57,371
<i>Please stand clear.
All personnel remain in your sector.</i>

517
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:01,471
<i>All right, team.
We do this fast, we do this efficiently.</i>

518
00:53:01,551 --> 00:53:04,970
<i>Nobody play hero here.
We let in one rotter at a time.</i>

519
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:07,104
<i>Bravo on the gate. Alpha on the rotters.</i>

520
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:10,594
<i>I don't want Zoe in there
until we have that rotter secured.</i>

521
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:33,660
- Let's go fishing.
- Let's do this.

522
00:53:42,082 --> 00:53:45,566
- Let them in one at a time.
- Weapons hot!

523
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,977
Ready!

524
00:53:51,083 --> 00:53:52,593
Go!

525
00:53:58,451 --> 00:54:01,070
Derek, you're up! Hold him still!

526
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:03,826
- All secured.
- Zoe!

527
00:54:06,717 --> 00:54:10,127
We got multiple bogies incoming!
We need to hurry!

528
00:54:16,249 --> 00:54:17,490
Got it.

529
00:54:18,783 --> 00:54:21,771
- Clear!
- Okay, we got the test sample!

530
00:54:21,851 --> 00:54:23,300
Just one more!

531
00:54:26,466 --> 00:54:29,337
Go! Move! Move your fucking asses!

532
00:54:29,617 --> 00:54:31,626
Go, go, go!

533
00:54:32,004 --> 00:54:36,057
They're breaching! Step away!
What the hell is taking so long?

534
00:54:36,137 --> 00:54:39,107
- I got him.
- They're ready to breach! Fall back!

535
00:54:39,187 --> 00:54:43,270
Fall back! Baca, the fence is buckling!

536
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:46,057
We can't hold it! Run!

537
00:54:55,033 --> 00:54:57,003
Go, go, go, go!

538
00:54:57,083 --> 00:54:58,693
Go!

539
00:55:11,249 --> 00:55:12,557
Zoe.

540
00:55:23,017 --> 00:55:24,837
You think I'm scared of you?

541
00:55:24,917 --> 00:55:28,992
I've killed hundreds of you fucking rotters.
I can't wait to put a bullet in you, too.

542
00:55:36,849 --> 00:55:38,693
She's your girlfriend.

543
00:55:42,083 --> 00:55:44,360
That conniving bitch.

544
00:55:47,283 --> 00:55:50,293
<i>Commander, come quick!
Something's happening outside!</i>

545
00:55:55,584 --> 00:55:58,237
<i>Initiating emergency shutdown procedure.</i>

546
00:55:58,317 --> 00:56:01,220
- <i>All personnel please fall back.</i>
- Get the gates!

547
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,304
Move your fucking asses!

548
00:56:03,384 --> 00:56:06,060
Go faster! They're right behind us!

549
00:56:06,916 --> 00:56:09,326
Go! Go! Go! Come on.

550
00:56:17,216 --> 00:56:20,293
How in the fuck did the rotters
get inside the perimeter fence?

551
00:56:23,416 --> 00:56:26,693
- We were getting blood samples.
- You just let them in?

552
00:56:29,056 --> 00:56:30,611
What the fuck?

553
00:56:38,016 --> 00:56:40,092
What the hell are you doing?

554
00:56:40,617 --> 00:56:43,537
My job. Protecting you people.

555
00:56:43,617 --> 00:56:46,595
Lieutenant, please.

556
00:56:46,675 --> 00:56:48,947
- Zoe can help.
- It's too late. There's nothing she can do.

557
00:56:49,027 --> 00:56:52,358
It's not a head bite! The infection
takes time with a bite like hers!

558
00:56:52,438 --> 00:56:55,097
The vaccine can work if it hasn't spread yet!

559
00:56:56,516 --> 00:56:58,527
Do you have the vaccine right now?

560
00:57:01,983 --> 00:57:03,792
I didn't think so.

561
00:57:08,456 --> 00:57:10,367
Are you fucking insane?

562
00:57:10,916 --> 00:57:13,216
- One bite, one bullet.
- Just because you have a gun...

563
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:16,803
...it does not mean you get to decide
who lives and who fucking dies!

564
00:57:16,883 --> 00:57:18,310
Are you sure about that?

565
00:57:19,849 --> 00:57:21,703
I thought I told you to not talk back to me.

566
00:57:21,783 --> 00:57:23,371
Miguel...

567
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,876
...put the gun down.

568
00:57:35,517 --> 00:57:38,171
12 hours. Then I kill it.

569
00:57:38,651 --> 00:57:40,927
Vaccine or no vaccine.

570
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:49,054
Miguel! Wait up!

571
00:57:54,517 --> 00:57:56,670
What the fuck was that back there?

572
00:57:56,750 --> 00:58:00,054
Pointing a gun on Zoe like that?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

573
00:58:00,134 --> 00:58:03,104
No, I'm a commanding officer whose own
fucking brother went behind his back...

574
00:58:03,184 --> 00:58:06,270
- ...and put this whole place in danger!
- Zoe needed those samples for all of us...

575
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:08,504
- ...and you know that!
- So you follow her orders now?

576
00:58:08,584 --> 00:58:12,760
Let me remind you who's in charge.
Not her, not you, not anybody else.

577
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:16,304
Miguel, you're cracking. I get it,
but that back there was bullshit!

578
00:58:16,384 --> 00:58:18,571
No, I'm the only one thinking rationally.

579
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:21,184
Everyone's chasing her empty
promises about this vaccine.

580
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:24,471
I'm your brother, Baca.
Your own flesh and blood.

581
00:58:24,551 --> 00:58:27,174
Believe me when I tell you she's fooling you.

582
00:58:28,283 --> 00:58:32,107
Don't you see what she's doing?
Why do you think she keeps this thing alive?

583
00:58:33,283 --> 00:58:34,970
What are you trying to say?

584
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:39,226
That rotter has her name engraved
on his arm. Wake up, Baca!

585
00:59:41,283 --> 00:59:43,126
I'm sorry about Elyse.

586
00:59:44,749 --> 00:59:46,846
I know you two were close.

587
00:59:48,049 --> 00:59:49,859
Thanks, Baca.

588
00:59:57,916 --> 01:00:01,380
Zoe, I need you to tell me
that you can really do this vaccine.

589
01:00:05,083 --> 01:00:06,970
You losing faith in me?

590
01:00:08,449 --> 01:00:11,494
Of course not. It's just...

591
01:00:13,882 --> 01:00:15,959
I mean, you don't get it.

592
01:00:17,016 --> 01:00:20,103
Thomas, Elyse...

593
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:22,924
...I ordered them out there for you...

594
01:00:23,004 --> 01:00:25,660
...for your vaccine. And they died.

595
01:00:27,516 --> 01:00:29,469
You're blaming me?

596
01:00:29,548 --> 01:00:32,551
Do you really think I would risk their
lives if I didn't think it was worth it?

597
01:00:32,631 --> 01:00:34,428
Honestly, I don't know
what to believe with you.

598
01:00:34,508 --> 01:00:37,933
- What the fuck does that mean?
- What the fuck is that thing to you?

599
01:00:38,517 --> 01:00:42,760
That thing has your name
carved into his forearm.

600
01:00:48,483 --> 01:00:50,938
You're hiding something from me, Zoe.

601
01:00:51,687 --> 01:00:53,526
So I need you to tell me.

602
01:00:56,249 --> 01:00:58,127
Who was that thing to you?

603
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:04,026
He was a fucking psycho...

604
01:01:04,882 --> 01:01:06,726
...who tried to rape me.

605
01:01:07,982 --> 01:01:10,026
Tried to take what he wanted from me.

606
01:01:12,316 --> 01:01:14,193
That's who he was.

607
01:01:16,416 --> 01:01:18,004
There.

608
01:01:18,513 --> 01:01:20,559
You happy now?

609
01:01:21,866 --> 01:01:23,726
Do you feel better?

610
01:01:25,116 --> 01:01:27,592
- Why didn't you just tell me?
- Because...

611
01:01:28,782 --> 01:01:30,626
...every time...

612
01:01:31,416 --> 01:01:33,104
...I talk...

613
01:01:33,184 --> 01:01:34,737
...think...

614
01:01:35,417 --> 01:01:37,292
...or look at him...

615
01:01:38,383 --> 01:01:41,973
...I have to relive the worst
fucking day of my life.

616
01:01:44,676 --> 01:01:47,926
Right now, I just need you to trust me
and believe in me, Baca.

617
01:01:51,816 --> 01:01:53,693
And if you can't...

618
01:01:57,749 --> 01:01:59,759
...I'll go it alone.

619
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:58,401
Let's drink tonight for those
who are no longer here.

620
01:02:59,383 --> 01:03:02,637
To Frank. Loving husband.

621
01:03:03,017 --> 01:03:05,037
Well, you know, here's to Thomas...

622
01:03:05,117 --> 01:03:08,487
...a guy that made
each one of us a better person.

623
01:03:08,567 --> 01:03:11,609
And to Elyse. I'll miss her dearly.

624
01:03:15,283 --> 01:03:16,903
To friends.

625
01:03:16,983 --> 01:03:18,392
- To friends.
- Friends.

626
01:03:33,549 --> 01:03:35,370
Hey, doc.

627
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:39,386
Figured you could use this.
I know you been going at it a while.

628
01:03:39,466 --> 01:03:41,276
Thanks, Alphonse.

629
01:03:51,149 --> 01:03:53,093
Man, you're ugly.

630
01:03:54,532 --> 01:03:56,077
Don't get too close.

631
01:03:57,816 --> 01:03:59,903
The lieutenant is right...

632
01:03:59,983 --> 01:04:03,392
- ...we should just kill this slippery fuck.
- Stand down, Lucy.

633
01:04:05,219 --> 01:04:06,599
Max!

634
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:11,830
Did he bite you?

635
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:14,093
I don't think so.

636
01:04:18,415 --> 01:04:20,826
No, you're good. He didn't get you.

637
01:04:22,449 --> 01:04:24,603
Lucy, you need to get some ice
on that head wound.

638
01:04:24,683 --> 01:04:27,552
- Al, take her down to the med ward.
- Come with me.

639
01:04:41,016 --> 01:04:42,889
One day...

640
01:04:43,849 --> 01:04:46,889
...and you're back trying
to fuck up my life again.

641
01:04:51,499 --> 01:04:54,174
Zoe.

642
01:05:05,132 --> 01:05:06,675
What?

643
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:22,392
You're nothing...

644
01:05:23,382 --> 01:05:25,193
...but filth.

645
01:05:26,249 --> 01:05:29,583
You are...

646
01:05:29,663 --> 01:05:31,462
...mine.

647
01:06:15,833 --> 01:06:18,676
- Zoe!
- Shut up!

648
01:06:24,582 --> 01:06:26,660
I have had enough of this!

649
01:06:28,849 --> 01:06:31,183
I know what you're trying to do,
and it is not going to work.

650
01:06:31,483 --> 01:06:33,470
I only have a few hours to stop this virus...

651
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:37,222
...and nothing you say or do
is going to fucking stop me!

652
01:06:48,016 --> 01:06:52,670
<i>Commencement of testing
for patient 15009, Max.</i>

653
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:55,203
<i>Beginning with current hypothesis of samples.</i>

654
01:06:55,283 --> 01:06:57,924
<i>Homo sapiens blood and anomaly cells...</i>

655
01:06:58,004 --> 01:07:00,737
<i>...otherwise known as rotter's blood.</i>

656
01:07:00,817 --> 01:07:04,270
<i>Current tests show that Homo sapiens
blood, despite the different amounts...</i>

657
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:07,303
<i>...all react consistently with our tests.</i>

658
01:07:07,383 --> 01:07:09,770
<i>The virus shows no signs of letting up.</i>

659
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:13,737
<i>It has, and always will,
infect us at alarming rates.</i>

660
01:07:13,817 --> 01:07:16,470
<i>Patient 15009's blood, however...</i>

661
01:07:16,550 --> 01:07:20,303
<i>...shows signs of dormant activity
within all human blood cells.</i>

662
01:07:20,383 --> 01:07:23,070
<i>They appear to coexist
without any signs of threat...</i>

663
01:07:23,149 --> 01:07:25,770
<i>...or exigency to our living blood samples.</i>

664
01:07:26,249 --> 01:07:31,470
<i>Despite the fact the idea of his blood in
anybody, let alone mine, is nauseating...</i>

665
01:07:31,550 --> 01:07:34,837
<i>...this is critical
for my hypothesis for the cure.</i>

666
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:37,403
<i>So here comes the moment of truth.</i>

667
01:07:37,483 --> 01:07:40,570
<i>Testing patient 15009's blood...</i>

668
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:43,037
<i>...against the anomaly rotter cells.</i>

669
01:07:43,116 --> 01:07:47,720
<i>If this works, patient 15009's blood
can be effectively engaged...</i>

670
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:52,237
<i>...in our bloodstream to kill off
any rotter cells before it spreads.</i>

671
01:07:52,767 --> 01:07:57,370
<i>Patient 15009's blood is the answer
to destroying the rotter cells...</i>

672
01:07:57,450 --> 01:07:59,607
<i>...in infected bodies...</i>

673
01:07:59,817 --> 01:08:02,026
<i>...if we aren't too late.</i>

674
01:08:04,482 --> 01:08:07,459
Baca? Come down here right now.

675
01:08:12,848 --> 01:08:14,406
You...

676
01:08:14,486 --> 01:08:17,284
...are mine.

677
01:08:26,749 --> 01:08:29,049
Oh, hey. Zoe, Zoe, what's the matter?

678
01:08:29,129 --> 01:08:31,359
- It's Max, he's free.
- Where is he?

679
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:32,926
- In the med lab.
- Let's go!

680
01:08:33,006 --> 01:08:35,693
No head shots! I need him alive!

681
01:08:41,682 --> 01:08:43,537
- Fuck!
- Shit!

682
01:08:43,617 --> 01:08:47,126
Sound the alarm. We need everyone
to get back to the township, now!

683
01:08:49,549 --> 01:08:53,650
<i>Emergency. All military personnel
please report to your squadron.</i>

684
01:08:54,049 --> 01:08:58,069
<i>Civilians are advised to remain
secured in the township.</i>

685
01:08:58,149 --> 01:09:03,383
<i>Emergency. All civilians are advised
to remain secured in the township.</i>

686
01:09:03,463 --> 01:09:06,339
<i>All residents to the township. I repeat...</i>

687
01:09:06,419 --> 01:09:09,297
<i>...everyone report
to the township immediately.</i>

688
01:09:09,377 --> 01:09:13,459
<i>This is not a drill.
I repeat, this is not a drill.</i>

689
01:09:29,949 --> 01:09:31,470
Lily!

690
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:33,837
Get everyone to the township!
I'll meet you there!

691
01:09:33,917 --> 01:09:36,727
- Be careful!
- I'll be okay!

692
01:09:55,365 --> 01:09:56,892
Mom?

693
01:09:58,915 --> 01:10:00,392
Mom?

694
01:10:08,382 --> 01:10:10,356
Oh, my God, Lily!
What are you doing out here?

695
01:10:10,436 --> 01:10:12,229
She's coming!

696
01:10:24,749 --> 01:10:27,092
Mommy, no! Please don't!

697
01:10:32,116 --> 01:10:34,570
- What's wrong? What's going on?
- Is something happening?

698
01:10:34,650 --> 01:10:36,934
- What do we do?
- Is it the rotters?

699
01:10:37,014 --> 01:10:39,370
- Quiet! Calm down, all right?
- Baca, is something happening?

700
01:10:39,450 --> 01:10:41,259
What the hell happened?

701
01:10:42,948 --> 01:10:44,903
It's the rotter.

702
01:10:44,983 --> 01:10:46,660
He's loose inside the complex.

703
01:10:53,299 --> 01:10:56,510
Don't worry. Everyone go back to your bed.
Everything's under control.

704
01:10:56,590 --> 01:10:58,346
- Lieutenant, something is not right.
- We need to know.

705
01:10:58,426 --> 01:11:02,092
Please, everything's okay.
Just go back to your homes.

706
01:11:10,281 --> 01:11:12,169
You happy now, Baca?

707
01:11:12,249 --> 01:11:15,048
I told you not to trust Zoe.
Find that rotter, kill it.

708
01:11:15,128 --> 01:11:17,381
No, we need to take it alive. There's
a chance we can still get that vaccine.

709
01:11:17,461 --> 01:11:21,202
Anyone that fails to comply to
my orders will be executed on the spot.

710
01:11:21,282 --> 01:11:24,203
We got a problem in the motor pool.
Guards aren't responding.

711
01:11:24,283 --> 01:11:26,837
We gotta get to the motor pool. Lucy,
Alphonse, stay here, protect the people.

712
01:11:26,916 --> 01:11:29,192
- Everyone else on me!
- Copy that!

713
01:11:36,947 --> 01:11:38,560
Lily.

714
01:12:38,848 --> 01:12:40,492
Let her go.

715
01:12:41,282 --> 01:12:43,727
Zoe.

716
01:12:45,465 --> 01:12:47,908
Let her go, Max.

717
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:50,859
I...

718
01:12:52,948 --> 01:12:55,683
...came for you.

719
01:12:55,763 --> 01:12:58,183
You...

720
01:12:58,263 --> 01:13:01,326
...need me.

721
01:13:02,449 --> 01:13:04,426
You want me alive...

722
01:13:07,382 --> 01:13:10,312
- ...let her go.
- No!

723
01:13:13,582 --> 01:13:15,472
Okay, okay.

724
01:13:16,848 --> 01:13:18,560
Now.

725
01:13:34,684 --> 01:13:37,009
<i>Main gate is now opening.</i>

726
01:13:46,515 --> 01:13:48,326
Let's go now!

727
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,175
No! No!

728
01:14:05,415 --> 01:14:06,958
Lily!

729
01:14:08,815 --> 01:14:10,262
Zoe!

730
01:14:25,415 --> 01:14:26,792
Zoe!

731
01:14:35,781 --> 01:14:38,008
Move! Move! Move!

732
01:14:52,416 --> 01:14:55,892
Lieutenant, what's the report
on the motor pool?

733
01:15:00,450 --> 01:15:02,504
Lieutenant, do you read me?

734
01:15:04,382 --> 01:15:05,809
Fuck!

735
01:15:18,599 --> 01:15:20,099
Shannon!

736
01:15:56,983 --> 01:15:58,802
Cover me! I'm going to close the door!

737
01:16:08,815 --> 01:16:12,550
Miguel, open that fucking door!
Lily and Zoe are still outside!

738
01:16:12,629 --> 01:16:15,685
I don't give a fuck! The rotters
got in because of that bitch Zoe.

739
01:16:15,765 --> 01:16:17,856
- That door stays closed.
- I am not leaving them outside!

740
01:16:17,936 --> 01:16:19,303
Stand down, Baca.

741
01:16:20,082 --> 01:16:23,223
So what, you're gonna shoot
your own brother now?

742
01:16:23,303 --> 01:16:25,359
I will if I have to.

743
01:16:27,881 --> 01:16:29,558
Don't make me do it.

744
01:16:36,182 --> 01:16:37,393
Miguel!

745
01:17:09,548 --> 01:17:13,503
<i>Main gate is now opening. Please stand clear.</i>

746
01:17:13,582 --> 01:17:16,812
<i>Main gate is now opening. Please stand clear.</i>

747
01:17:26,948 --> 01:17:28,524
Lily!

748
01:17:30,515 --> 01:17:33,359
- Sweetie, are you okay?
- Yeah.

749
01:17:35,115 --> 01:17:36,958
Here, come on.

750
01:17:38,416 --> 01:17:40,292
In here, sweetie.

751
01:18:54,615 --> 01:18:57,193
Zoe.

752
01:19:12,249 --> 01:19:15,768
You are...

753
01:19:15,848 --> 01:19:17,369
...mine!

754
01:19:17,448 --> 01:19:20,298
No. You're mine, motherfucker!

755
01:19:23,881 --> 01:19:25,858
Come on, Lil.

756
01:19:50,724 --> 01:19:52,558
Baca, don't!

757
01:20:05,282 --> 01:20:07,125
It's too late.

758
01:20:07,948 --> 01:20:10,825
I can feel it in my body.

759
01:20:12,682 --> 01:20:15,137
It's... it's turning me.

760
01:20:15,686 --> 01:20:17,703
You haven't fully turned yet.

761
01:20:18,482 --> 01:20:20,503
The vaccine can still work.

762
01:20:21,253 --> 01:20:22,775
No.

763
01:20:24,815 --> 01:20:27,203
I don't wanna be one of those things, Zoe.

764
01:20:27,682 --> 01:20:29,491
Baca, please.

765
01:20:31,681 --> 01:20:34,558
- I'm sorry.
- I can stop the virus.

766
01:20:37,748 --> 01:20:39,658
Believe me.

767
01:20:40,982 --> 01:20:43,731
I can stop the virus.

768
01:20:44,314 --> 01:20:46,186
You just have to trust me.

769
01:20:49,515 --> 01:20:51,358
I love you, Baca.

770
01:21:06,075 --> 01:21:08,602
<i>I've used up what I could from patient...</i>

771
01:21:08,682 --> 01:21:11,103
<i>...from Max's blood on Baca.</i>

772
01:21:11,782 --> 01:21:15,103
<i>I could only dispense so much
as I need the remaining samples...</i>

773
01:21:15,183 --> 01:21:19,003
<i>...to create a mass production
schedule for the antivirus.</i>

774
01:21:19,832 --> 01:21:23,802
<i>I dislike the idea that Baca
is technically and conveniently...</i>

775
01:21:23,882 --> 01:21:26,203
<i>...my first human test subject.</i>

776
01:21:26,622 --> 01:21:29,036
<i>This will speed things up
in getting the antivirus...</i>

777
01:21:29,116 --> 01:21:31,788
<i>...into mass production for everybody.</i>

778
01:21:46,115 --> 01:21:49,736
<i>To everybody out there,
to anyone who is listening...</i>

779
01:21:49,816 --> 01:21:53,169
<i>...I'm broadcasting this
from High Rock emergency bunker.</i>

780
01:21:53,248 --> 01:21:57,063
<i>Our doors are open. We have
an inoculation against the rotter bite...</i>

781
01:21:57,782 --> 01:22:01,258
...a vaccine that will keep anyone
who takes it from turning.

782
01:22:02,681 --> 01:22:04,970
From now on, when you greet the day...

783
01:22:05,849 --> 01:22:08,925
<i>...know this world is not
as dangerous as it used to be.</i>

784
01:22:10,214 --> 01:22:11,923
<i>Things are changing.</i>

785
01:22:12,582 --> 01:22:15,169
<i>And while we can't put the world back...</i>

786
01:22:16,198 --> 01:22:18,474
<i>...there's still beauty in it.</i>

787
01:22:19,381 --> 01:22:22,391
<i>There's still hope that we can be safe...</i>

788
01:22:23,815 --> 01:22:27,070
<i>...and that it's okay for us
to let our guard down now...</i>

789
01:22:27,949 --> 01:22:29,725
<i>...to be happy...</i>

790
01:22:31,214 --> 01:22:33,025
<i>...and to love.</i>
