he took his son cheung fung,

9
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,574
and left the world of martial arts.

10
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:37,083
I'm done.

11
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:44,078
I have another job in 2 days for you.

12
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:46,039
Target's a hoodlum.

13
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,240
Someone who's had enough

14
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:49,990
wants to teach him a lesson.

15
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:51,375
I'm out

16
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,539
no children, no women

17
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:57,327
and no nice guys.

18
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:00,329
So this guy isn't against your rules.

19
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,161
Look I'll double your pay.

20
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:04,407
Think it over.

21
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:05,827
I said I'm done.

22
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:09,414
All you know is fighting.

23
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:10,247
Walking away now?

24
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,865
What a pity!

25
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:14,578
I want a simple life.

26
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,948
Nothing to pity about.

27
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:22,827
Hold on!

28
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,323
I have a question.

29
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,164
So which is faster?

30
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:31,202
Your fist or my gun?

31
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,081
Over 7 paces,

32
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,581
gun's faster.

33
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,164
Within 7 paces,

34
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,333
my fist.

35
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,536
We're around 7 paces apart.

36
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:57,407
Stop!

37
00:02:58,417 --> 00:02:59,372
People pay you.

38
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:00,702
To solve their problems.

39
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:03,749
Since even money can't change your mind.

40
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,205
I'll respect your decision.

41
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,375
Go!

42
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,287
Lifting your jacket is
what slowed you down.

43
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,333
Fung!

44
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:45,708
Fung fung!

45
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:47,578
Time to get up for school.

46
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,286
Get up.

47
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,538
What's for breakfast?

48
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:03,625
Plain congee and breadsticks again?

49
00:04:03,792 --> 00:04:05,453
Can we eat something else?

50
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,118
Okay.

51
00:04:07,292 --> 00:04:09,123
I'll get something else tomorrow.

52
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,115
You say that every time.

53
00:04:13,417 --> 00:04:14,623
Liar!

54
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:30,497
Tin chi!

55
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,618
Morning, auntie luk!

56
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:33,663
Papal!

57
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:35,032
Today's a big day.

58
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,703
You have to get off work on time.

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,160
Boss,

60
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:39,828
I just started working.

61
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,073
You want me to get off already?

62
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,285
Don't be lazy.

63
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:43,867
Okay!

64
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,581
Let's check the delivery list.

65
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,619
Soy sauce, 10 bottles...

66
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,824
Chilli sauce, 6 bottles...

67
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,493
Peanuts, 5 packs.

68
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,500
Give me hand.

69
00:04:57,917 --> 00:04:58,781
Auntie luk

70
00:04:58,792 --> 00:05:00,828
could you watch my store
while I make a delivery

71
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,198
oh sure! Don't you worry

72
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,208
thank you!

73
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:06,990
Auntie luk I'm going to school!

74
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Good boy!

75
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:14,663
Hey!

76
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:15,667
Hey! Cheung fung

77
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:17,202
there you go.

78
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:19,656
Papal!

79
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,282
Remember we have plans tonight.

80
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:23,123
So be on time okay?

81
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,036
You're the one who needs to
remember to be on time.

82
00:05:25,042 --> 00:05:26,623
Don't get detention.

83
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:27,239
You hear me?

84
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,250
Don't worry!

85
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:31,532
The bus is here!

86
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:36,952
Be careful.

87
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,289
I will! Bye!

88
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,035
Bye!

89
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,625
You...

90
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:08,789
Hey Nana!

91
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:13,249
You forgot to pay me.

92
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:15,327
Fat lung,

93
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,573
same as before.

94
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:17,823
Put it on my tab.

95
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,164
Hey, your tab is a mile long

96
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:22,158
you must pay it all today.

97
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,375
Tomorrow.

98
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,619
I'll pay you tomorrow. Promise.

99
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:27,907
It's not my decision

100
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:29,748
tell the boss yourself.

101
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,117
Hey boss!

102
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,331
She's broke again.

103
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,125
Hey boss!

104
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,285
Sorry, kit.

105
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:04,990
Here boss.

106
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,115
Who needs your sympathy?

107
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,077
Make a call.

108
00:07:23,917 --> 00:07:25,282
Get someone to bring money.

109
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,289
If you don't pay up now

110
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:34,578
I'll sell you to a brothel

111
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,164
in the south pacific.

112
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,250
Excuse me!

113
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:55,990
Can I see the black bat?

114
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Sure!

115
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:11,743
I'll take it.

116
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,410
Please wrap it up for me.

117
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,080
Eat!

118
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:35,743
Julial

119
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,081
well look who's here?

120
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,206
I brought the money.

121
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:44,583
Let her go!

122
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:46,875
Count it.

123
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,539
I'm warning you.

124
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:55,249
Don't sell opium to her again.

125
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:57,578
But she wants me to.

126
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,616
Talk to her, not me.

127
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,240
You beat her up.

128
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:07,748
I'm letting that slide.

129
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:09,577
If you hit her again,

130
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,323
I'll make sure you pay for it.

131
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:14,583
Hold on!

132
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:20,078
This is just the principal.

133
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:21,740
What about interest?

134
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:24,282
I need 500 more.

135
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:26,407
You won't get another dime,

136
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:28,828
Nana's coming with me.

137
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,365
I'd like to see

138
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:31,873
what you can do about it.

139
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,991
With no more money you're not leaving!

140
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,250
Grab them!

141
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:17,032
You broke my present.

142
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,083
Get lost!

143
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:47,583
Go!

144
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,083
Go on!

145
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:10,077
Police!

146
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,493
What's going on?

147
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,990
Freeze! What are you doing!

148
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,205
Freeze!

149
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,410
Arrest them all!

150
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:19,499
Stop!

151
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,038
Police business!

152
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:22,327
What's going on?

153
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,333
Why were you fighting?

154
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,331
- Officer...
- You're coming as well.

155
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:29,542
Move it!

156
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:32,781
Sit over there!

157
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:33,913
Move it!

158
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,573
What's your name?

159
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,114
Cheung tin chi.

160
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,331
Where do you work?

161
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:47,032
Tin kee store.

162
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,456
Our records show,

163
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,414
cheung tin chi

164
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:53,203
is active in underground boxing arenas

165
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,573
as a fighter.

166
00:11:55,292 --> 00:12:00,241
You were arrested,
at the west union shipyard

167
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,581
for gang fighting before.
We have it all here.

168
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,073
I was helping someone.

169
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,414
Oh like you did today?

170
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:05,417
That's right!

171
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,073
He was helping us.

172
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,539
I'm not talking to you.

173
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,448
Listen up,

174
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,994
fighting anywhere in public

175
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,740
is against the law.

176
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:19,708
You!

177
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:24,156
Sir?

178
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:25,623
It's just self-defense

179
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,785
let them all go.

180
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:27,451
Huh?

181
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,948
This is an order!

182
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:34,952
No problem sir.

183
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:41,452
Why'd you get in a fight

184
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,039
let them all go.

185
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:55,583
Hey!

186
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,949
Why can they leave and we can't go?

187
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,365
Who the hell are you?

188
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,457
I'm chiu kam fu's sister.

189
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,161
That's the guy who owns gold bar.

190
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:07,498
What a pain!

191
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,831
Yeah you can go!

192
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,742
Thank you... lets go

193
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:19,292
Officer,

194
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,740
when can I go?

195
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,539
Take a new statement from him.

196
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:28,623
You can go after that.

197
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:39,076
It's almost 10 o'clock. Where is he?

198
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:43,697
Fung!

199
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:44,739
- Quick hurry!
- You're late!

200
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,490
Give me back my allowance from last month.

201
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,205
Okay!

202
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,914
- I know! I'm changing.
- Take off your pants!

203
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:49,872
- I'm changing okay?
- Hurry!

204
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:50,830
I'll help you...

205
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,164
Papa! Hurry!

206
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:52,952
I'm coming

207
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,869
hey your zipper is down!

208
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,083
Okay!

209
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,197
Here! Come on.

210
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,368
Quick!

211
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:05,868
Papa! Hurry hurry!

212
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:06,993
Coming coming!

213
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:14,577
Hello!

214
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,244
Sorry, we're closed.

215
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,411
Birthday! Birthday me!

216
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:21,907
Sorry, young man.

217
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:24,533
All of our chefs have
gone home for the night.

218
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,241
Come back anytime.

219
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:33,823
Okay? Come back!

220
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:39,499
It's your fault!

221
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:51,911
You can't have steak,

222
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,948
but you still have a present.

223
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,116
Wow! It's black bat!

224
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:14,281
Papal!

225
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:15,623
There's no music!

226
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,456
How come?

227
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:20,781
It can't be.

228
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:23,955
Papa it's alright, it's a gift from you.
I love it

229
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,081
So boss.

230
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,368
Other than steak,

231
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:33,535
what else do you want to eat?

232
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,743
Braised beef,

233
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,365
fried beef with Kale...

234
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,865
Tomato and beef stew!

235
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,206
Nothing but beef?

236
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,869
You have something against beef?

237
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:43,167
Very well.

238
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:44,953
Let's go.

239
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,243
We'll have a beef feast.

240
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,823
Cheung lok

241
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,664
is the number one gang,

242
00:15:57,667 --> 00:15:59,203
not because we have the most members

243
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,540
or the most money.

244
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:04,784
But because we have trust.

245
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,698
But I just found out

246
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,245
one of our own has been stealing from us.

247
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:11,999
My father used to say:

248
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,456
Without trust,

249
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,994
a man has nothing.

250
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,994
Remember that uncle hung?

251
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:19,906
I remember!

252
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:22,124
Your old man and I started out together.

253
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:25,783
These scars you see here.

254
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:28,659
Helped him carve out his
turf and make his name.

255
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:30,703
So what if I took some money?

256
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:31,914
What's the problem?

257
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:33,827
There's no problem.

258
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:40,032
Even if you're a founding member

259
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:42,454
doesn't mean you can break the rules.

260
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,365
Take him home.

261
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,410
Today,

262
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,744
I want to discuss something
important with you.

263
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,161
It's about cheung lok's future.

264
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:57,498
I am planning

265
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,240
to legalize our business

266
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,250
completely.

267
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,322
In 3 years,

268
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,493
I want cheung lok

269
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,081
to be squeaky clean.

270
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,414
Your decision

271
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,619
will have a major impact on business.

272
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:08,489
That's right!

273
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,365
Been a gangster all my life.

274
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:11,952
It's the only thing I know.

275
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:13,868
And trading

276
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,740
isn't as profitable as smuggling.

277
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,830
Listen!

278
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,698
I can't guarantee that

279
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,575
we'll make as much money
as we do in the black market.

280
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,414
But I can promise you

281
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,328
that from now on.

282
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,369
No one will have to go to jail

283
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,411
or get himself killed.

284
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,990
If you ask me,

285
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,618
it's the opposite.

286
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:34,953
Cheung lok now has clout.

287
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,365
We should capitalize

288
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,410
and we expand!

289
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:39,157
Consolidate our position.

290
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:40,452
With enough weight,

291
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:43,203
neither side of the law
will dare mess with us!

292
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,823
Since we have different opinions,

293
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,911
let us vote to decide.

294
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,369
Those in favor of legalizing cheung lok

295
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,660
raise your hands.

296
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:10,577
You're the boss,

297
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:11,747
you call the shots.

298
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,785
Thank you!

299
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:15,374
From now on,

300
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,455
we should refrain, from using violence.

301
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:17,789
Let's work together

302
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,786
to transform cheung lok.

303
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,199
Wow black bat is so amazing!

304
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,164
He took out all the bad
guys with 3 punches!

305
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:32,167
Well...

306
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:33,702
My dad is more awesome.

307
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,074
He can knock down the
baddies with one punch.

308
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,119
He's the grandmaster of wing chun.

309
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:41,328
That's a lie, cheung fung!

310
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:43,953
My father is the grandmaster.

311
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,662
He runs a martial arts
club and he's brilliant.

312
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:56,953
Papa used to own a club as well.

313
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,414
My dad is the best around!

314
00:18:58,417 --> 00:18:59,281
Used to?!

315
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:01,032
Now he runs a tiny store.

316
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:02,282
He's a grocery man.

317
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:03,827
Grocery man...

318
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,164
Grocery man...

319
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:06,953
Papa is the grandmaster of wing chun.

320
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,615
He's a grocery man.

321
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:24,868
Let's eat...

322
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:29,663
Not hungry?

323
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:31,328
They call you a grocery man.

324
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:33,032
And that's what I am.

325
00:19:33,042 --> 00:19:34,282
You're not!

326
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:46,660
Papa,

327
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,536
I'm sorry... l

328
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:49,577
forget it.

329
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:51,077
Let's eat.

330
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,663
Papal!

331
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,082
You won't teach wing chun anymore?

332
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,080
Go sleep.

333
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,116
"Cheung tin chi,
the rising star in martial arts world"

334
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,915
"cheung tin chi, undefeated in wing chun"

335
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,032
Papa, help me!

336
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:35,615
- Papa!
- Fung!

337
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:36,614
I'm scared!

338
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:37,660
Papal!

339
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:39,123
- Fung!
- It's on fire!

340
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:41,911
- Papa!
- Come, don't be afraid

341
00:21:43,792 --> 00:21:46,659
- papa I'm scared!
- Don't worry!

342
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,164
Papa is here, don't worry.

343
00:21:58,542 --> 00:22:00,373
Papa hurry up!

344
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,080
Don't worry.

345
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,744
- Almost done!
- I can't breathe! Papal!

346
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,865
Hurry!

347
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,411
Papa hurry!

348
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,115
Come here, fung!

349
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:21,708
Here use this!

350
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,500
Fung!

351
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,785
Fung!

352
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,118
Papal!

353
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:02,032
Don't worry...

354
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,081
Here come, sit down.

355
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,243
Don't worry...

356
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,574
Crossing you is the same as crossing me.

357
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,539
I'll kill him for you today.

358
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:22,614
Oh come on.

359
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:23,956
He still got out?!

360
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:26,623
Are you sure you can handle it?

361
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:32,789
Papa! Papa!

362
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:35,369
Papal!

363
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:43,831
Kill him!

364
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,118
Quick!

365
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:59,083
I got a plan for people like him.

366
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:12,578
Stop! Stop!

367
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,581
Please watch my son! I beg you!

368
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:22,913
Thank you!

369
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:25,328
Papa papa...

370
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:31,333
Fung!

371
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:33,375
Fung!

372
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:29,119
Hey! Your son has fainted!

373
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:32,625
Fung!

374
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:36,167
He's got a fever.

375
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:37,413
Take him to a hospital.

376
00:28:37,542 --> 00:28:38,542
Quick!

377
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:41,083
Fung!

378
00:28:50,417 --> 00:28:52,954
Miss kwan, kit is causing trouble again.

379
00:29:02,292 --> 00:29:03,953
Papa, it hurts!

380
00:29:05,792 --> 00:29:08,408
Bear with it. You'll be fine soon.

381
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:14,117
I don't want to be here. I want to go home.

382
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:19,042
Here...

383
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:20,953
Why don't you have an apple?

384
00:29:21,917 --> 00:29:23,077
Look!

385
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:33,583
Thank you!

386
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:35,667
It's fine.

387
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:41,073
Move aside.

388
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:44,415
Here. Ahh!

389
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:48,073
The boy is seriously hurt.

390
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:49,573
What kind of parents are you?

391
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:06,702
Yes, sir!

392
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:08,823
Understand, sir!

393
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:21,414
We know what happened.

394
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:23,373
It was an accident. Let's go.

395
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:24,375
Officer,

396
00:30:24,542 --> 00:30:25,827
I know who did it.

397
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:27,039
I told you,

398
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:28,407
it was an acc-i-dent!

399
00:30:28,417 --> 00:30:29,532
How is that possible?

400
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:31,703
They burnt his home and tried to kill him.

401
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:33,039
Why won't you investigate?!

402
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,870
It's a police matter. Don't lecture me!

403
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:37,740
Let's go!

404
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,035
Papal!

405
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:48,871
If our house is burnt
down, where will we go?

406
00:30:53,708 --> 00:30:55,073
I can help you.

407
00:30:56,292 --> 00:30:57,998
My brother owns gold bar.

408
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,410
I'll take you to meet him.

409
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,365
I bought you new clothes.

410
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:02,364
You're meeting the boss,

411
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:04,081
so you need to look presentable.

412
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,286
Julia. You're early!

413
00:31:08,958 --> 00:31:10,038
Ming, where's my brother?

414
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:11,327
He's in a meeting.

415
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,365
That's not fair at all!

416
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,365
You stole all of my customers.

417
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:16,581
I want you to pay for my loss.

418
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,119
You should pay me. I'm losing money too.

419
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:19,956
I said it first! No you I said you...

420
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,910
You guys are both wrong!

421
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:26,703
We just want Harmony on bar street.

422
00:31:26,708 --> 00:31:27,788
You two!

423
00:31:28,042 --> 00:31:29,452
Drink what I made you

424
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,160
and stop fighting.

425
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:35,873
No price war either!

426
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:37,490
Drink up!

427
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:42,368
What's wrong?

428
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:43,455
Is there a problem?

429
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:44,698
No... no...

430
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:49,948
It's delicious, fu!

431
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:51,164
- Nice!
- We should go.

432
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:52,373
Yeah... bye

433
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:55,282
fu, Julia is here.

434
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,614
Brother.

435
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:01,456
This is my friend cheung tin chi.

436
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:06,285
He's in a bit of a bind.

437
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:08,035
I want to take them in.

438
00:32:08,042 --> 00:32:09,157
What's that?

439
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:10,282
No...

440
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,282
Staying with you is a bad idea.

441
00:32:12,292 --> 00:32:13,532
You live with Nana.

442
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:14,782
Let them live with me.

443
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:16,744
Hey kid, come here!

444
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:18,907
You're scaring him!

445
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:20,748
How can he stay with you?

446
00:32:21,458 --> 00:32:22,698
I'm sorry.

447
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:23,914
We'll go

448
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:26,493
no wait.

449
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:29,913
Fu,

450
00:32:29,917 --> 00:32:31,578
tin chi saved me and Nana.

451
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,160
You taught me that,

452
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:35,032
friends have a moral
obligation to each other.

453
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:38,708
Fine fine.

454
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:44,119
Listen carefully. These two girls

455
00:32:45,417 --> 00:32:47,328
one is my sister,

456
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:49,331
one is my future wife.

457
00:32:49,417 --> 00:32:50,327
They're off limits.

458
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:51,493
Don't even think about it.

459
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,456
I can pay rent.

460
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:55,948
Let me work at the bar.

461
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:57,410
I'll work in exchange for a place to stay.

462
00:32:57,417 --> 00:32:58,497
Whatever!

463
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,411
Make sure you show up on time tonight.

464
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:04,698
Come on in!

465
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:11,865
Just make yourselves at home.

466
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:13,115
Don't be shy.

467
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:17,663
Nana!

468
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:22,373
Stop walking around like that!

469
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,706
You're practically naked!

470
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:26,456
You usually wear less than me!

471
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:28,198
When do I wear less than you?

472
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:31,494
I always dress properly.

473
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,706
Believe me.

474
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:46,162
Papa, papa. There's a fire!

475
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:47,167
Papal!

476
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,580
Papal!

477
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,830
Fung!

478
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:50,833
It's okay.

479
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,240
I'm here.

480
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,991
It's fine...

481
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,250
Who's that?

482
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:28,327
Where's tso sai kit.

483
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:29,368
He's not here.

484
00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:33,458
Out!

485
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:18,665
Dancing with me together, come in!

486
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,490
Buy me one drink.

487
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,535
Buy me one drink.

488
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:25,198
Come.

489
00:35:50,542 --> 00:35:52,032
No...

490
00:35:53,667 --> 00:35:55,032
Hello.

491
00:35:55,917 --> 00:35:57,202
I drink.

492
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:01,740
Let me.

493
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:04,831
Thank you!

494
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:07,994
Hey! It's cheung!

495
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:32,913
"Kiss me, honey, honey, kiss me"

496
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:36,822
"thrill me, honey, honey, thrill me"

497
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:40,572
"don't care even if I blow my top"

498
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:43,746
"but, honey honey, don't stop..."

499
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:48,825
"I'd like to play a little game with you"

500
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:52,700
"a little game especially made for two"

501
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,663
"if you come close then
I will show you how"

502
00:36:56,958 --> 00:37:00,496
"closer, closer, now"

503
00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:04,489
"kiss me, honey, honey, kiss me"

504
00:37:04,917 --> 00:37:08,205
"thrill me, honey, honey, thrill me"

505
00:37:08,792 --> 00:37:12,034
"don't care even if I blow my top"

506
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:15,617
"but, honey honey, don't stop..."

507
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:22,208
Are you blind?

508
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:23,875
Pick it up.

509
00:37:26,708 --> 00:37:28,494
You make money from me.

510
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:32,790
I gave you an order, you follow it.

511
00:37:33,792 --> 00:37:34,827
Pick it up.

512
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Pick

513
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,125
up!

514
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:54,160
Sorry sorry.

515
00:37:54,292 --> 00:37:55,907
He's new.

516
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,161
Happy happy...

517
00:37:58,333 --> 00:37:59,163
Kam,

518
00:37:59,167 --> 00:38:00,373
take care of him.

519
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:02,953
My friend, come on, come on.

520
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:07,824
You! Come here!

521
00:38:10,292 --> 00:38:11,577
"Don't stop..."

522
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:16,542
Cheung tin chi,

523
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:17,833
who do you think you are?

524
00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:19,907
Is it humiliating to pick it up?

525
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:22,616
Pride is not worth a dime here understand?

526
00:38:23,042 --> 00:38:24,042
I picked it up.

527
00:38:24,208 --> 00:38:25,823
There's a rule here on bar street.

528
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:27,288
Customers are always right.

529
00:38:27,542 --> 00:38:31,114
Don't you ever for... get.

530
00:38:44,208 --> 00:38:45,038
Allow me.

531
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:46,083
No I can manage.

532
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:47,990
I'm happy to do it.

533
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:51,582
Fung, eat your breakfast.

534
00:38:57,167 --> 00:38:58,953
Why is it congee again?

535
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:04,707
It was just your first day at the bar.

536
00:39:05,167 --> 00:39:07,203
And I know everything is new.

537
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:08,664
But you'll get used to it.

538
00:39:11,542 --> 00:39:12,542
I mean,

539
00:39:13,042 --> 00:39:14,828
you put up with so much.

540
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:16,323
How can you bear it?

541
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:21,075
Our job is to make the customers happy.

542
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:23,574
Just smile and it'll blow over.

543
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:24,663
Oh and,

544
00:39:24,667 --> 00:39:26,157
please don't be angry with my brother.

545
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:28,203
He's worried you'd offend the foreigners.

546
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:30,498
Sure. It's forgotten.

547
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,615
Papa, does it hurt?

548
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:39,163
No way!

549
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:55,910
Who did this?

550
00:39:55,917 --> 00:39:57,032
Cheung tin chi.

551
00:39:58,917 --> 00:40:00,077
Stop!

552
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:07,115
This is my opium den.

553
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:08,956
I'll take care of it.

554
00:40:08,958 --> 00:40:10,823
This is cheung lok business.

555
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:13,283
I made it clear to everyone.

556
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:14,873
No more trouble.

557
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:17,282
If you can't handle it,

558
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:18,623
I'll take over.

559
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:19,910
The place is burned down.

560
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,282
Just shut it down.

561
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:24,282
And no vengeance.

562
00:40:25,042 --> 00:40:27,249
Don't compromise cheung lok's reputation.

563
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,740
No vengeance?

564
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,785
What's wrong with vengeance?

565
00:40:29,792 --> 00:40:30,952
If 1 let him go,

566
00:40:30,958 --> 00:40:32,323
that would be wrong!

567
00:40:34,958 --> 00:40:35,947
Brothers!

568
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:38,244
We're going to kill cheung tin chi!

569
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,582
Take kit home.

570
00:40:50,042 --> 00:40:51,282
Don't forget his medicine.

571
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:54,203
I don't need sympathy.

572
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,660
Follow him.

573
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:23,156
Please enjoy!

574
00:41:23,167 --> 00:41:24,907
This drink is for you.

575
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:30,743
I'm working right now.

576
00:41:33,167 --> 00:41:35,078
It's okay. I'm buying.

577
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:54,072
Impressive!

578
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:55,198
Who are you?

579
00:41:56,708 --> 00:41:58,369
My brother burnt down your house.

580
00:41:58,375 --> 00:42:00,206
This is for your house.

581
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:02,824
I hope we can put all this behind us.

582
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:06,539
I burnt down his opium den.

583
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,661
This is for his opium den.

584
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:10,282
Don't bother me again.

585
00:42:10,917 --> 00:42:12,453
Not many people would dare to

586
00:42:12,917 --> 00:42:14,373
use that tone with me.

587
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:15,375
Miss kwan!

588
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:18,665
What brings you here?

589
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:20,578
We have catching up to do.

590
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:23,582
I also came to meet your new friend.

591
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,115
Tin chi,

592
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:30,207
miss kwan is my benefactor.

593
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:31,993
I used to work for her.

594
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,740
Everyone has heard of

595
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,206
cheung lok, and tso ngan kwan.

596
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:36,993
Fu,

597
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,080
that's enough.

598
00:42:38,417 --> 00:42:40,373
Miss kwan made me what I am today!

599
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:41,535
I should go.

600
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:42,572
Cheung tin chi,

601
00:42:42,583 --> 00:42:43,572
you have personality.

602
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,868
I won't force your hand.

603
00:42:44,875 --> 00:42:45,580
From now on,

604
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:46,618
if you need anything,

605
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:48,115
just come to me.

606
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,864
Remember.

607
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:51,411
Put it behind you.

608
00:42:51,417 --> 00:42:52,247
This cheque,

609
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,490
covers my tab.

610
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:56,038
Miss kwan,

611
00:42:56,042 --> 00:42:57,452
let me buy a round!

612
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:09,331
Impressive!

613
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,662
Remember we used to play
with water pistols?

614
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:14,618
Then peashooters

615
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:15,705
and now real guns.

616
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:17,164
You're such a sharpshooter.

617
00:43:17,167 --> 00:43:18,327
Impressive!

618
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:21,407
What is it?

619
00:43:21,417 --> 00:43:23,078
You're the heir of cheung lok.

620
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:24,414
And your sister has your back.

621
00:43:24,417 --> 00:43:25,281
So what's wrong?

622
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:26,577
You look down on me now?

623
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:28,244
Why would you think that?

624
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,911
I'm just telling you the truth.

625
00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:33,291
Every shot must have its purpose.

626
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:35,490
She's always the boss.

627
00:43:35,833 --> 00:43:38,415
She's just telling me
what I can and can't do.

628
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,490
How can I make it big?

629
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:43,286
Because you were born too late.

630
00:43:43,667 --> 00:43:44,667
Honestly.

631
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:48,657
I told you.

632
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,615
You should be independent.

633
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,623
It's not easy.

634
00:43:57,917 --> 00:43:59,123
Is it that hard?

635
00:44:00,792 --> 00:44:02,202
If you don't try it.

636
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:03,618
You have nothing.

637
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:06,164
If you dare to dream.

638
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:07,167
It's all possible.

639
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,706
You seem to be,

640
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:10,914
doing well.

641
00:44:11,917 --> 00:44:13,202
What have you been up to?

642
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:14,573
Just small business.

643
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:15,993
You wouldn't dare do it.

644
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,536
I sell heroin.

645
00:44:19,042 --> 00:44:20,202
What's there to be afraid of?

646
00:44:21,042 --> 00:44:22,373
If we do this,

647
00:44:22,375 --> 00:44:23,865
we can be the biggest game in town.

648
00:44:24,542 --> 00:44:26,102
Wan chai district is under our control.

649
00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:29,289
We can sell on bar street.

650
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:30,623
The bars are always busy.

651
00:44:30,917 --> 00:44:31,917
Good.

652
00:44:32,375 --> 00:44:33,740
We'll be partners.

653
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:34,535
Count me in.

654
00:44:34,542 --> 00:44:35,748
Are you out of your mind?

655
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:37,240
Partners?

656
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,241
If your sister finds out,

657
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,706
she'll chop me up and feed me to the dogs.

658
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:41,743
Besides,

659
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,615
don't mess with chiu kam fu.

660
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,580
I won't man.

661
00:44:46,208 --> 00:44:47,368
There's no way.

662
00:44:48,667 --> 00:44:49,873
Leave my sister to me.

663
00:44:49,875 --> 00:44:51,081
I'll sort it out.

664
00:44:51,667 --> 00:44:52,452
As for fu,

665
00:44:52,458 --> 00:44:53,573
if you can't.

666
00:44:53,583 --> 00:44:54,698
I will.

667
00:44:59,167 --> 00:45:00,247
Good!

668
00:45:01,625 --> 00:45:02,740
We're brothers.

669
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:03,705
You got my back

670
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:04,743
and I have your back.

671
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:05,739
We're partners now.

672
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:07,661
We'll make money together!

673
00:45:07,667 --> 00:45:08,907
Here's to us.

674
00:45:08,917 --> 00:45:10,407
Cheers!

675
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:29,493
Hey!

676
00:45:31,292 --> 00:45:33,078
This is rent for the month.

677
00:45:33,083 --> 00:45:34,914
I told you I would pay.

678
00:45:36,458 --> 00:45:37,948
Keep it and buy some candy for your son.

679
00:45:37,958 --> 00:45:39,243
Buy it yourself.

680
00:45:39,958 --> 00:45:41,619
Always so much pride.

681
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:44,705
Hey!

682
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:47,950
I heard you used to practise
orthodox wing chun.

683
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:50,916
You challenged ip man but
he refused to fight.

684
00:45:50,917 --> 00:45:51,952
That's something.

685
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,824
I want to challenge ip man.

686
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,036
Why did you close your dojo?

687
00:46:00,542 --> 00:46:01,622
I didn't want to teach anymore.

688
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:03,115
Didn't want to teach?

689
00:46:03,542 --> 00:46:05,498
You were at the top of the game.

690
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,115
Let me see what you got.

691
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:08,581
Let's have a go.

692
00:46:09,125 --> 00:46:10,285
I don't remember.

693
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:11,618
Quit playing.

694
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:14,581
How about...

695
00:46:14,583 --> 00:46:17,199
The loser has to take the money.

696
00:46:44,333 --> 00:46:46,289
Punching from mid air is
such a stupid mistake.

697
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,410
I like somersaults.

698
00:46:48,417 --> 00:46:49,497
What's it to you?

699
00:46:57,208 --> 00:46:58,744
I'm a grown man,

700
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:00,866
no one has ever slapped me before.

701
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:01,910
How dare you!

702
00:47:01,917 --> 00:47:03,282
You like to fight.

703
00:47:03,292 --> 00:47:05,172
I'm disciplining you on
behalf of your parents.

704
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:07,493
Asshole!

705
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:10,990
Again?

706
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:12,830
You swore.

707
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:13,913
You deserved it.

708
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:16,448
Can you fight me properly?

709
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,039
Don't slap me.

710
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,456
Why don't you use wing chun?

711
00:47:53,625 --> 00:47:55,536
I don't need wing chun now.

712
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:02,956
Can't you show me some respect?

713
00:48:03,458 --> 00:48:04,914
I'll have you fired!

714
00:48:08,042 --> 00:48:09,248
Money's yours.

715
00:48:09,667 --> 00:48:11,077
Hey! Keep it a secret!

716
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:12,289
Don't tell anyone.

717
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:14,374
Don't tell anyone you beat me.

718
00:48:40,833 --> 00:48:42,198
Nothing left.

719
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,456
This is still intact.

720
00:48:54,958 --> 00:48:56,289
The music box.

721
00:49:09,667 --> 00:49:10,667
Julial

722
00:49:10,875 --> 00:49:12,831
that's not how you do it.

723
00:49:13,458 --> 00:49:14,994
Let me show you.

724
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,411
You're pretty good.

725
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,032
Did your father teach you?

726
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:26,164
He used to teach me wing chun.

727
00:49:26,167 --> 00:49:27,782
But not anymore.

728
00:49:28,083 --> 00:49:28,788
Julia,

729
00:49:28,792 --> 00:49:30,123
I can teach you wing chun.

730
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:30,826
Really?

731
00:49:30,833 --> 00:49:31,322
Yes.

732
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:32,743
Well then thank you shifu!

733
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,036
See if this is right.

734
00:49:57,667 --> 00:49:58,372
Sorry!

735
00:49:58,375 --> 00:49:59,375
I'm so sorry!

736
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:00,868
It's alright.

737
00:50:01,542 --> 00:50:02,702
Sorry...

738
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:04,702
I'l fix it.

739
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,865
I only use it to hang clothes.

740
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:13,708
Let's go.

741
00:50:19,042 --> 00:50:22,205
Fung, I used to check out the balcony.

742
00:50:22,292 --> 00:50:23,077
What's out there?

743
00:50:23,083 --> 00:50:24,289
The sunrise.

744
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:25,830
Sunrise?

745
00:50:26,417 --> 00:50:27,907
More like moon rise.

746
00:50:36,292 --> 00:50:38,078
When the lights come on over bar street,

747
00:50:38,083 --> 00:50:39,573
that's my sunrise.

748
00:50:40,375 --> 00:50:41,740
When the lights come on,

749
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:44,787
I'm able to forget all the
unhappy things in my life.

750
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:48,498
You're easy to please.

751
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,706
You can be so...

752
00:50:50,708 --> 00:50:52,244
So simple!

753
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,991
Happiness should be simple.

754
00:50:57,458 --> 00:51:00,370
If I can do the things I like every day,

755
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:01,865
I'll be very happy.

756
00:51:03,208 --> 00:51:05,995
What do you think I like to do?

757
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Eat?

758
00:51:07,083 --> 00:51:08,948
That means he thinks you're dumb.

759
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:10,823
He's talking about you.

760
00:51:10,833 --> 00:51:12,915
Papa, who are you talking about?

761
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:15,206
You, of course!

762
00:51:15,708 --> 00:51:18,324
Two adults bullying a kid!?

763
00:51:22,042 --> 00:51:23,748
You're not really angry.

764
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:29,249
What makes me happy.

765
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:32,572
Is being at gold bar every day,
singing and dancing.

766
00:51:32,583 --> 00:51:35,165
That's how I can show my talent.

767
00:51:37,292 --> 00:51:39,453
When you find the place where you belong,

768
00:51:39,958 --> 00:51:41,573
win or lose,

769
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:43,289
you won't want to leave.

770
00:51:43,792 --> 00:51:45,578
I don't think that's true.

771
00:51:46,083 --> 00:51:47,744
Whether I come or go,

772
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,331
is a matter of choice.

773
00:51:49,875 --> 00:51:53,618
Well it might be a choice
that you made in a fit of anger.

774
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:56,332
And when you calm down you'll realize that,

775
00:51:57,292 --> 00:52:00,989
you left that day, so you
could return one day.

776
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:21,491
Dad, I finally got my steak!

777
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:24,825
Fung. It's your belated birthday party.

778
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:26,824
Eat as much as you like.

779
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:28,164
I'll take you up on that!

780
00:52:28,167 --> 00:52:29,167
Brother.

781
00:52:29,417 --> 00:52:31,999
Just cause he's buying, don't pig out

782
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:34,414
thanks for inviting us.

783
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:35,623
It's my pleasure.

784
00:52:39,542 --> 00:52:40,702
Actually,

785
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:42,956
I should thank all of you.

786
00:52:43,875 --> 00:52:45,490
I barged into your lives.

787
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,082
Yet you all greeted me with open arms.

788
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:50,365
And took such good care of fung.

789
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,707
I'm very honored to have friends like you.

790
00:52:52,708 --> 00:52:54,573
Here. A toast to you!

791
00:52:54,583 --> 00:52:55,993
Who said we were friends?

792
00:52:56,458 --> 00:52:58,039
On bar street,

793
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:00,289
we're all family.

794
00:53:01,083 --> 00:53:03,540
Here. Cheers!

795
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,536
Happy birthday!

796
00:53:08,042 --> 00:53:09,452
This is for you.

797
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,616
Wow! It's black bat.

798
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:16,241
I volunteer at an orphanage.

799
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:17,911
A child there made that for me.

800
00:53:18,542 --> 00:53:19,907
Mr. Davidson,

801
00:53:19,917 --> 00:53:21,123
thanks for the arrangements,

802
00:53:21,125 --> 00:53:22,490
and the beautiful cake.

803
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,910
You are very welcome.

804
00:53:24,125 --> 00:53:26,207
I have other guests to attend to.

805
00:53:26,208 --> 00:53:28,164
So, excuse me. Have a wonderful time.

806
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:29,956
- Thank you!
- Bye bye!

807
00:53:47,667 --> 00:53:50,283
Good evening everyone and welcome.

808
00:53:50,292 --> 00:53:52,078
Our humble organization,

809
00:53:52,083 --> 00:53:55,951
strives to stimulate the Hong Kong economy,

810
00:53:55,958 --> 00:53:59,121
but we also want to give
back to the community.

811
00:53:59,125 --> 00:54:02,288
So tonight's proceeds for
our charity auction,

812
00:54:02,292 --> 00:54:07,036
will go towards rebuilding homes destroyed
in the recent typhoons.

813
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:12,290
There we can show everyone
how big our hearts are

814
00:54:12,292 --> 00:54:16,285
and how deep our pockets are.

815
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:20,242
And our first item up for bid is this

816
00:54:20,417 --> 00:54:23,614
beautiful antique qing dynasty vase.

817
00:54:23,667 --> 00:54:26,625
The bidding will start at $5,000.

818
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:29,661
$10,000!

819
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:30,955
$12,000!

820
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
$12,000!

821
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:33,625
$15,000!

822
00:54:34,292 --> 00:54:35,292
$15,000!

823
00:54:36,292 --> 00:54:37,327
$20,000!

824
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:38,239
$20,000!

825
00:54:38,292 --> 00:54:39,372
$100,000!

826
00:54:42,458 --> 00:54:43,823
That's a lot of money!

827
00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:46,365
$100,000!

828
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:48,323
Anyone else?

829
00:54:49,417 --> 00:54:50,497
Sold!

830
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:55,163
To this very generous lady, will you
please come and introduce yourself?

831
00:55:03,292 --> 00:55:07,114
I'd like to thank the merchant association
for this opportunity.

832
00:55:08,833 --> 00:55:11,199
On behalf of cheung lok company,

833
00:55:11,208 --> 00:55:15,577
we extend our Sincere wishes to
the victims of the typhoon

834
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:19,405
and urge everyone here
tonight to give generously.

835
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:21,032
Cheung lok's a triad gang!

836
00:55:22,375 --> 00:55:24,366
You're using dirty money for charity.

837
00:55:24,875 --> 00:55:26,536
It'll be a curse for the victims.

838
00:55:27,208 --> 00:55:28,823
Doing business with a gangster?

839
00:55:29,375 --> 00:55:31,115
If we let her in,

840
00:55:31,125 --> 00:55:34,697
we'd be condoning their evildoing.

841
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:39,530
We cannot accept money
from organized crime.

842
00:55:39,542 --> 00:55:41,373
Yes, absolutely...

843
00:55:42,167 --> 00:55:43,782
You... please leave.

844
00:55:43,875 --> 00:55:45,331
You're not welcome here.

845
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:47,498
Yes, you're not welcome.

846
00:55:47,583 --> 00:55:48,868
Get out...

847
00:55:49,417 --> 00:55:52,329
Please! Everyone. Please calm down!

848
00:55:53,875 --> 00:55:54,875
Miss,

849
00:55:55,625 --> 00:55:57,240
I must apologize,

850
00:55:58,708 --> 00:56:01,666
but a merchant association
is a collective body,

851
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:05,242
and I must respect the
wishes of all my members.

852
00:56:06,417 --> 00:56:11,741
Since there is some objection
to your background,

853
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:15,241
I'm afraid we can only accept
your generosity in spirit.

854
00:56:15,708 --> 00:56:17,118
I do apologize.

855
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:29,744
I haven't always made an honest living,
I admit that.

856
00:56:30,542 --> 00:56:32,908
But take a good hard look at yourselves.

857
00:56:34,833 --> 00:56:37,540
You are not so different, you lie,

858
00:56:37,875 --> 00:56:40,457
you cheat, you exploit.

859
00:56:41,625 --> 00:56:43,786
Are you willing to admit that?

860
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,661
I didn't think so.

861
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:02,740
Excuse us.

862
00:57:29,333 --> 00:57:30,448
Where's it from?

863
00:57:30,458 --> 00:57:31,458
It's...

864
00:57:33,333 --> 00:57:34,243
Speak.

865
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:38,198
The guy who runs his street,
his name is fat lung.

866
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Go

867
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:58,285
In the back!

868
00:58:04,958 --> 00:58:06,118
Wow.

869
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:11,165
Whoa. Look at that!

870
00:58:12,375 --> 00:58:13,375
Wow brother.

871
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,365
We made a killing

872
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:18,492
on chiu kam fu's turf!

873
00:58:18,917 --> 00:58:20,327
Amazing!

874
00:58:20,333 --> 00:58:21,448
I must hand it to you.

875
00:58:21,458 --> 00:58:22,538
You've got nerve!

876
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:24,661
Chiu kam fu is nothing.

877
00:58:24,958 --> 00:58:26,914
He's no tiger, just a sick kitty.

878
00:58:26,917 --> 00:58:27,952
Exactly!

879
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,740
Take this!

880
00:58:34,542 --> 00:58:35,873
Unload this!

881
00:59:31,792 --> 00:59:33,373
Tso sai kit is peddling drugs.

882
00:59:35,417 --> 00:59:36,953
You must tell your brother.

883
00:59:37,458 --> 00:59:38,914
This will be tricky.

884
00:59:39,458 --> 00:59:41,540
He's indebted to his sister.

885
00:59:41,833 --> 00:59:44,370
I'm afraid there's nothing he can do.

886
00:59:47,708 --> 00:59:49,039
This is the last one.

887
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:21,082
Mr. Davidson! Hi!

888
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:22,289
Here I am!

889
01:00:23,625 --> 01:00:25,035
Mr. Davidson,

890
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:26,407
nice to meet you.

891
01:00:29,333 --> 01:00:31,494
He is my buddy.

892
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:34,367
Kit is the boss of cheung lok,

893
01:00:34,375 --> 01:00:37,332
a big, big gang in Hong Kong.

894
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:40,825
With him on board, we make money more...

895
01:00:42,417 --> 01:00:44,248
You take a look!

896
01:00:48,667 --> 01:00:49,873
Triple!

897
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:57,872
I only work with the best people.

898
01:00:59,792 --> 01:01:01,407
There's only one steak.

899
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:03,740
Who's eating?

900
01:01:07,875 --> 01:01:08,955
Boss,

901
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,615
don't play me!

902
01:01:12,167 --> 01:01:14,579
This steak is huge.

903
01:01:14,958 --> 01:01:17,290
We can... we can share.

904
01:01:21,375 --> 01:01:22,490
What are you doing?

905
01:01:24,042 --> 01:01:26,242
You think it's the first time
I've had a gun to my head?

906
01:01:26,917 --> 01:01:28,953
Your bullets are for
target practice, asshole!

907
01:01:28,958 --> 01:01:30,539
Just like you said.

908
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:34,041
Every shot must have its purpose.

909
01:01:34,667 --> 01:01:37,989
This shot is worth everything.

910
01:01:46,417 --> 01:01:48,578
I guess your sister is right.

911
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:52,994
You're nothing but a loser.

912
01:02:01,917 --> 01:02:05,364
If you kill me, it will be your loss.

913
01:02:05,375 --> 01:02:06,535
Really?

914
01:02:08,792 --> 01:02:12,956
So many people could take your place.

915
01:02:24,292 --> 01:02:30,367
I admire you. People like you
are destined for great things.

916
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:36,656
I would have worked with you
even if you hadn't killed him.

917
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:40,741
Sit, eat.

918
01:03:19,333 --> 01:03:20,493
Cheung tin chi.

919
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,832
What do you think of my calligraphy?

920
01:03:25,583 --> 01:03:27,448
"Martial arts is the righteous path"

921
01:03:27,583 --> 01:03:29,164
you train your mind with martial arts.

922
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:31,869
But you're not calm.

923
01:03:32,833 --> 01:03:34,824
You have not practised in a while.

924
01:03:36,042 --> 01:03:37,157
Over the years,

925
01:03:37,167 --> 01:03:39,203
I've looked after the business.

926
01:03:39,208 --> 01:03:41,745
My hands, held a saber

927
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:43,081
and they were stained with blood.

928
01:03:43,458 --> 01:03:45,824
It's been a while since I used a brush.

929
01:03:46,792 --> 01:03:49,283
And now, that I want to straight.

930
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:52,204
I realized that doing the right thing
is even more difficult.

931
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:55,280
Taking your father's place as a woman

932
01:03:55,292 --> 01:03:56,702
couldn't have been easy.

933
01:03:57,458 --> 01:03:59,164
But with determination,

934
01:03:59,167 --> 01:04:00,748
anything is possible.

935
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:04,368
I underestimated you by thinking
you're only a good martial artist.

936
01:04:05,583 --> 01:04:07,539
I'm sure you didn't stop by today

937
01:04:07,542 --> 01:04:09,578
just to have a chat

938
01:04:13,458 --> 01:04:15,790
tso sai kit's dealing drugs on bar street.

939
01:04:17,458 --> 01:04:19,244
What will you do about it?

940
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,206
I want you to stop him.

941
01:04:23,208 --> 01:04:26,325
It's not that simple. Let me deal with him.

942
01:04:26,917 --> 01:04:28,373
I will need some time.

943
01:04:28,375 --> 01:04:29,375
Fine.

944
01:04:30,417 --> 01:04:31,623
I will wait.

945
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:01,081
Let me help you.

946
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,865
My old drug addiction.

947
01:05:09,083 --> 01:05:10,994
Left me with all these problems.

948
01:05:11,458 --> 01:05:13,915
I know that it wasn't
easy to kick the habit.

949
01:05:14,292 --> 01:05:15,702
Take it one day at a time.

950
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:20,115
Even though I can stand the cravings,

951
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:22,581
I'm afraid someday,

952
01:05:23,375 --> 01:05:25,787
I'll be tempted by it again.

953
01:05:25,875 --> 01:05:28,036
We're just like sister.

954
01:05:28,042 --> 01:05:29,907
Through thick and thin.

955
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:32,286
You know that we'll manage.

956
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,786
You must have faith in yourself.

957
01:05:47,125 --> 01:05:48,080
Waiter,

958
01:05:48,083 --> 01:05:49,368
another?

959
01:05:50,167 --> 01:05:51,373
Make it a double!

960
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:52,993
Hey! Excuse me!

961
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Check please!

962
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:57,660
Thank you, boss!

963
01:05:57,667 --> 01:06:00,033
Good... one more...

964
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:02,539
I can't...

965
01:06:03,375 --> 01:06:04,785
I really can't.

966
01:06:06,667 --> 01:06:11,536
Good... that's my girl! One more?

967
01:06:47,458 --> 01:06:49,039
Hey boss! She stole from us!

968
01:06:49,042 --> 01:06:51,158
Kit I didn't... I didn't steal anything!

969
01:06:55,083 --> 01:06:57,074
How dare you try and steal from me.

970
01:06:57,333 --> 01:06:59,198
I didn't... I didn't steal from you

971
01:06:59,208 --> 01:07:00,288
I didn't steal from you.

972
01:07:02,875 --> 01:07:04,206
What's your hurry?

973
01:07:04,708 --> 01:07:05,788
You going to report me?

974
01:07:05,792 --> 01:07:07,623
No! I wouldn't... I wouldn't dare

975
01:07:07,625 --> 01:07:09,240
I wouldn't dare... I don't know anything

976
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:10,956
I don't know...

977
01:07:12,667 --> 01:07:13,952
Good girl!

978
01:07:14,917 --> 01:07:16,999
You deserve a nice reward don't you?

979
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,410
Give me a bag.

980
01:07:41,417 --> 01:07:43,157
Fu will make you pay for this!

981
01:07:43,167 --> 01:07:45,749
I'm tso sai kit! I'm not
scared of that fool!

982
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:46,785
Grab her!

983
01:07:57,375 --> 01:07:59,331
So you mean you haven't
been here in 2 months?

984
01:07:59,333 --> 01:08:00,118
Yeah, that's right!

985
01:08:00,125 --> 01:08:02,286
Hey! Where's Nana?

986
01:08:02,583 --> 01:08:04,039
Ok, I'll find her.

987
01:08:21,708 --> 01:08:25,155
Hey! Have a drink lady! Come on!

988
01:09:07,583 --> 01:09:10,780
Nana. Nana!

989
01:09:11,583 --> 01:09:13,744
I didn't take the drugs.

990
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,740
I really...

991
01:09:17,208 --> 01:09:18,288
I know.

992
01:09:19,375 --> 01:09:20,865
I know, Nana.

993
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:23,368
Nana...

994
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,993
Anyone there?!

995
01:09:25,875 --> 01:09:27,411
Please help me!

996
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:40,620
That is the wrong move.

997
01:09:42,875 --> 01:09:46,288
No sis. It was the right move.

998
01:09:48,792 --> 01:09:50,373
Each time you screwed up,

999
01:09:50,375 --> 01:09:53,242
father made you kneel right in here
in this room all night,

1000
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:54,740
to reflect.

1001
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:58,288
Every time, I'd sneak in here
and played Chinese checkers with you.

1002
01:09:58,292 --> 01:09:59,748
To keep you company.

1003
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:01,115
Remember that?

1004
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:03,456
Sure I do.

1005
01:10:04,417 --> 01:10:05,452
Actually,

1006
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:07,832
I really hate Chinese checkers.

1007
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:12,411
Because they remind me,

1008
01:10:12,417 --> 01:10:14,999
of my mistakes and punishment.

1009
01:10:15,583 --> 01:10:16,583
So?

1010
01:10:17,125 --> 01:10:18,740
Did you ask me here

1011
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:20,661
to punish me again?

1012
01:10:22,167 --> 01:10:24,408
Everything I do is for your own good.

1013
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:27,411
You used to listen to me.

1014
01:10:27,792 --> 01:10:29,578
Why have we drifted apart so much?

1015
01:10:29,583 --> 01:10:31,494
Because I listened to you!

1016
01:10:31,917 --> 01:10:33,578
So everyone looked down on me.

1017
01:10:34,792 --> 01:10:35,907
To them,

1018
01:10:35,917 --> 01:10:37,202
I'm just your kid brother.

1019
01:10:37,208 --> 01:10:38,744
They don't even know my name

1020
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:40,661
is tso sai kit.

1021
01:10:42,083 --> 01:10:43,118
But,

1022
01:10:43,125 --> 01:10:44,740
starting today,

1023
01:10:45,583 --> 01:10:47,289
I don't need you.

1024
01:10:48,667 --> 01:10:49,702
Get in here!

1025
01:11:09,292 --> 01:11:10,452
Sai kit,

1026
01:11:10,792 --> 01:11:13,499
drugs are out of your league.
You can't handle it.

1027
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:14,535
Give it up!

1028
01:11:14,958 --> 01:11:16,289
But this path.

1029
01:11:16,708 --> 01:11:18,824
Is what I have chosen.

1030
01:11:29,125 --> 01:11:30,456
Tso sai kit!

1031
01:11:30,458 --> 01:11:31,243
Come out!

1032
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:32,365
Kill him!

1033
01:12:27,542 --> 01:12:28,702
You get him!

1034
01:12:48,125 --> 01:12:49,125
Leave!

1035
01:13:19,083 --> 01:13:20,448
You promised to give me time.

1036
01:13:20,458 --> 01:13:21,573
It's too late.

1037
01:13:21,792 --> 01:13:24,329
Drugs are already killing
people on bar street.

1038
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,080
Step aside sister!

1039
01:15:37,625 --> 01:15:38,239
Sai kit!

1040
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:39,250
Come on!

1041
01:15:40,458 --> 01:15:41,664
Your kung fu is useless!

1042
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:43,248
Fight my gun with your fist!

1043
01:15:45,083 --> 01:15:46,414
Come get me!

1044
01:16:09,083 --> 01:16:10,163
His arm

1045
01:16:10,625 --> 01:16:12,832
is a peace offering.

1046
01:16:15,667 --> 01:16:16,667
Miss kwan!

1047
01:16:16,958 --> 01:16:18,368
An arm can't make up for a life!

1048
01:16:18,375 --> 01:16:19,535
If you don't drop the matter.

1049
01:16:19,917 --> 01:16:22,283
I'll raze bar street to the ground.

1050
01:16:24,292 --> 01:16:25,532
We won't take his life.

1051
01:16:25,958 --> 01:16:27,414
But what about the drugs?

1052
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,331
We must settle this.

1053
01:16:30,792 --> 01:16:32,783
Where are the drugs hidden?

1054
01:16:47,625 --> 01:16:49,581
There's no going back after this.

1055
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:52,330
Any regrets?

1056
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:57,491
I gave up martial arts to open a bar.

1057
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,741
So I could live a quiet life.

1058
01:17:03,542 --> 01:17:05,658
I always remind myself,

1059
01:17:05,667 --> 01:17:08,989
to exercise restraint.

1060
01:17:13,792 --> 01:17:15,623
But after all these years,

1061
01:17:15,625 --> 01:17:18,162
trouble still comes knocking.

1062
01:17:18,792 --> 01:17:20,407
I once thought that

1063
01:17:21,458 --> 01:17:24,040
my martial arts could make me famous.

1064
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:28,037
I even used it to make a living
as a fighter for hire.

1065
01:17:28,042 --> 01:17:30,328
But I really just wanted a simple life.

1066
01:17:30,917 --> 01:17:33,909
I thought I could put
martial arts behind me.

1067
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:38,740
But deep down,

1068
01:17:39,708 --> 01:17:41,573
I know I never could.

1069
01:17:44,375 --> 01:17:46,331
Those of us who fight

1070
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,867
never understood the true
meaning of martial arts.

1071
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:53,786
You challenged ip man.

1072
01:17:53,792 --> 01:17:55,953
You sure know the true
meaning of martial arts.

1073
01:17:55,958 --> 01:17:57,243
Cheung tin chi,

1074
01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:58,535
I think you're pretty good.

1075
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,457
I fought ip man. Behind closed doors.

1076
01:18:07,458 --> 01:18:08,573
I lost.

1077
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:12,365
How'd you lose?

1078
01:18:13,417 --> 01:18:14,577
By just one move.

1079
01:18:14,583 --> 01:18:17,120
By one move? And you gave it all up?

1080
01:18:17,958 --> 01:18:19,118
Do you realize

1081
01:18:19,125 --> 01:18:21,537
that martial arts, isn't about winning?

1082
01:18:21,542 --> 01:18:23,533
Then why did you make
me fight you last time?

1083
01:18:23,542 --> 01:18:25,203
Because I needed to teach you manners.

1084
01:18:25,417 --> 01:18:27,408
I wanted to punch you for ages!

1085
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:35,207
All of Hong Kong have heard about this now.

1086
01:18:36,875 --> 01:18:39,082
I've been ordered to
clamp down on narcotics.

1087
01:18:40,208 --> 01:18:41,948
I can't protect you anymore.

1088
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:44,331
For the time being,

1089
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:46,119
take your merchandise elsewhere.

1090
01:18:46,625 --> 01:18:47,535
Lay low for a bit.

1091
01:18:47,542 --> 01:18:50,830
Hong Kong is ruled by the British empire.

1092
01:18:51,917 --> 01:18:56,456
Can't have a Chinese hero running around.

1093
01:18:58,125 --> 01:19:00,286
Today is one person, tomorrow...

1094
01:19:00,292 --> 01:19:02,203
An entire uprising.

1095
01:19:03,042 --> 01:19:04,998
How will you keep order?

1096
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:08,206
How will I do business?

1097
01:19:08,958 --> 01:19:12,450
Now, anyone who raises a fuss,

1098
01:19:12,458 --> 01:19:14,198
you do what I pay you for.

1099
01:19:16,292 --> 01:19:17,292
Cheers!

1100
01:19:31,125 --> 01:19:32,786
Quick! Move it!

1101
01:19:32,792 --> 01:19:35,158
Get in! Police check!

1102
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:35,952
Turn off the music.

1103
01:19:35,958 --> 01:19:37,494
Men on one side, women on the other.

1104
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:39,831
Over there!

1105
01:19:40,667 --> 01:19:41,998
You, move it!

1106
01:19:43,167 --> 01:19:44,828
Over there, quick!

1107
01:19:46,333 --> 01:19:47,493
Over there!

1108
01:19:53,333 --> 01:19:54,994
We received a tip.

1109
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,456
Someone here is dealing drugs.

1110
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:57,868
We need to search the bar.

1111
01:19:57,875 --> 01:19:58,875
Quiet!

1112
01:20:00,125 --> 01:20:01,410
Quiet!

1113
01:20:04,333 --> 01:20:05,333
Fai sir,

1114
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:07,411
I run a legitimate business.

1115
01:20:07,417 --> 01:20:08,998
Is this necessary?

1116
01:20:10,208 --> 01:20:11,869
The gweilo's in charge.

1117
01:20:11,875 --> 01:20:12,990
This isn't a joke.

1118
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,490
Just cooperate.

1119
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:35,457
Sir, heroin!

1120
01:20:38,708 --> 01:20:40,164
Asshole!

1121
01:20:40,875 --> 01:20:42,035
You set me up!

1122
01:20:42,042 --> 01:20:44,454
He's been implicated in
the dealing of narcotics.

1123
01:20:44,583 --> 01:20:45,663
Arrest him.

1124
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:47,365
Take him away.

1125
01:20:49,208 --> 01:20:51,824
He said you're dealing drugs.
And to arrest you.

1126
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:52,875
Take him away!

1127
01:20:53,875 --> 01:20:55,160
Stay where you are.

1128
01:20:55,167 --> 01:20:56,657
Fu...

1129
01:20:56,667 --> 01:20:57,622
Don't move!

1130
01:20:57,625 --> 01:21:00,367
If you give us trouble!
We'll arrest everyone!

1131
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:08,240
God damn police!

1132
01:21:12,792 --> 01:21:13,702
Tin chi...

1133
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:14,788
Don't move!

1134
01:21:18,458 --> 01:21:19,743
Police?

1135
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:21,542
Right?

1136
01:21:23,583 --> 01:21:25,790
You called arson an accident.

1137
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:28,241
Someone was murdered in gold bar.
You did nothing.

1138
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:29,786
You let the real drug dealers go free

1139
01:21:29,792 --> 01:21:31,077
and planted evidence to
frame an innocent man.

1140
01:21:31,083 --> 01:21:32,789
What kind of police is that?

1141
01:21:32,917 --> 01:21:34,578
I don't know anything about a set up.

1142
01:21:35,083 --> 01:21:36,289
We do our job

1143
01:21:36,292 --> 01:21:37,498
and follow orders.

1144
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,161
You can't tell right from wrong!

1145
01:21:44,042 --> 01:21:46,328
Where's your conscience?

1146
01:21:50,417 --> 01:21:51,873
I have nothing to hide

1147
01:21:51,875 --> 01:21:53,411
and a clear conscience.

1148
01:21:53,833 --> 01:21:55,448
He's caught red-handed,

1149
01:21:55,458 --> 01:21:57,289
why can't we arrest him?

1150
01:21:58,792 --> 01:21:59,827
Stop!

1151
01:22:00,625 --> 01:22:01,956
I'm the owner of gold bar.

1152
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:03,494
I don't need you to get involved.

1153
01:22:04,417 --> 01:22:05,623
Whatever happens,

1154
01:22:05,625 --> 01:22:06,956
I take responsibility.

1155
01:22:09,458 --> 01:22:10,914
Don't make trouble.

1156
01:22:15,167 --> 01:22:17,829
Let him go. He wouldn't sell drugs!

1157
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:18,833
Don't worry.

1158
01:22:19,167 --> 01:22:21,579
I'll be home for breakfast.

1159
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:34,207
Nothing to see. Step back!

1160
01:22:34,208 --> 01:22:35,323
Put him in the car.

1161
01:22:35,333 --> 01:22:38,291
You two, take your teams
and search the other bars.

1162
01:22:41,667 --> 01:22:43,032
Yes, sir!

1163
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:44,202
Yes, sir!

1164
01:22:50,042 --> 01:22:52,784
Nothing to see. Just go back inside.

1165
01:22:53,083 --> 01:22:55,324
Nothing to see! Leave!

1166
01:22:55,333 --> 01:22:56,333
Move!

1167
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,662
Enjoy yourself, I will wait outside.

1168
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:03,285
It was you the generous - philanthropist!

1169
01:24:04,625 --> 01:24:06,991
Let it sit for 5 minutes,

1170
01:24:07,417 --> 01:24:10,489
and it will be perfect.

1171
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,410
Ready to eat.

1172
01:24:15,333 --> 01:24:17,824
I prefer my fried beef and tomatoes.

1173
01:24:17,833 --> 01:24:19,448
Who wants your bloody steak?

1174
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:22,241
But you should enjoy your last meal.

1175
01:24:23,292 --> 01:24:26,830
And if I want you to eat, you will eat.

1176
01:24:27,417 --> 01:24:29,248
Chinese don't have options.

1177
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:31,832
Every person has the right to choose.

1178
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:34,575
I chose to open a bar and
you chose to sell drugs.

1179
01:24:34,625 --> 01:24:35,625
Right?

1180
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:39,617
And you choose to stick your nose
into others people's business.

1181
01:24:40,083 --> 01:24:41,573
You chose wrong.

1182
01:24:42,292 --> 01:24:44,032
And now you have to die.

1183
01:24:45,542 --> 01:24:46,998
My mistake was

1184
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,572
I just found out that
you're a son of a bitch!

1185
01:26:32,875 --> 01:26:35,457
The steak would have been perfect by now.

1186
01:26:36,083 --> 01:26:37,664
And you wasted it.

1187
01:27:03,208 --> 01:27:04,368
The police said.

1188
01:27:04,583 --> 01:27:07,780
Fu tried to escape from custody

1189
01:27:07,792 --> 01:27:09,953
and was killed when he fell down a cliff.

1190
01:27:12,208 --> 01:27:14,073
I don't believe it...

1191
01:27:55,625 --> 01:27:56,455
Miss kwan,

1192
01:27:56,458 --> 01:27:57,743
the car is ready.

1193
01:28:01,167 --> 01:28:03,203
I have somewhere to go first.

1194
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:23,081
You can't go.

1195
01:28:27,708 --> 01:28:28,948
Get out of my way.

1196
01:28:35,208 --> 01:28:36,664
Nana is dead.

1197
01:28:38,333 --> 01:28:40,039
My brother is dead.

1198
01:28:41,875 --> 01:28:44,036
But that foreigner is alive and well.

1199
01:28:44,792 --> 01:28:46,748
The police know everything

1200
01:28:47,625 --> 01:28:49,991
and yet they did nothing at all!

1201
01:28:52,042 --> 01:28:53,998
They won't do anything!

1202
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:00,956
You don't need to do anything.

1203
01:29:01,958 --> 01:29:03,698
I will do it for you.

1204
01:29:06,958 --> 01:29:08,038
Papa,

1205
01:29:09,792 --> 01:29:11,657
you have to come back.

1206
01:29:20,042 --> 01:29:21,077
Fung,

1207
01:29:22,375 --> 01:29:23,740
there is something,

1208
01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:26,241
papa has to take care of.

1209
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:32,740
But I promise,

1210
01:29:34,542 --> 01:29:36,078
I'll come back soon.

1211
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:39,285
Papa,

1212
01:29:39,292 --> 01:29:41,749
I want congee and fried
breadsticks tomorrow.

1213
01:30:05,875 --> 01:30:07,035
Wait here.

1214
01:31:01,833 --> 01:31:03,619
After we leave Hong Kong,

1215
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:05,411
we'll start over.

1216
01:31:47,667 --> 01:31:48,667
Hey!

1217
01:31:53,375 --> 01:31:54,535
Mr. cheung?

1218
01:31:57,208 --> 01:31:58,539
How can I help you?

1219
01:32:00,208 --> 01:32:01,243
You forgot this.

1220
01:32:06,833 --> 01:32:10,746
Don't make crazy accusations,
that's not mine.

1221
01:32:10,750 --> 01:32:12,081
What about this?

1222
01:32:28,583 --> 01:32:32,622
So what now, Mr. cheung?

1223
01:34:08,833 --> 01:34:10,448
I can fix it.

1224
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:12,991
You Chinese think too highly of yourself.

1225
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,161
Always wanting to be the hero.

1226
01:34:17,042 --> 01:34:19,033
Hasn't anyone told you.

1227
01:34:19,042 --> 01:34:20,907
That heroes die quickly?

1228
01:34:28,167 --> 01:34:29,373
I'm sorry!

1229
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:31,456
Papa is going to be fine.

1230
01:34:31,875 --> 01:34:33,365
Because he's my black bat.

1231
01:34:33,375 --> 01:34:35,115
He'll defeat the bad guys.

1232
01:34:35,125 --> 01:34:37,286
Because he's the best.

1233
01:34:49,667 --> 01:34:51,749
I didn't come here to be a hero.

1234
01:35:06,917 --> 01:35:08,532
I came here to beat you.

1235
01:35:18,792 --> 01:35:19,907
Wing chun,

1236
01:35:20,417 --> 01:35:21,702
cheung tin chi.

1237
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:49,956
Move! Step aside!

1238
01:37:52,542 --> 01:37:53,542
What's this?

1239
01:37:54,042 --> 01:37:55,452
Who's making a scene?

1240
01:37:55,458 --> 01:37:56,458
Leave!

1241
01:38:01,583 --> 01:38:03,323
Leave! There's nothing more to see

1242
01:38:16,833 --> 01:38:20,030
He has assaulted this person
and damaged his property.

1243
01:38:20,042 --> 01:38:21,122
Arrest him.

1244
01:38:25,083 --> 01:38:27,870
We're charging you for assault

1245
01:38:27,875 --> 01:38:28,990
and damaging property.

1246
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,240
You're under arrest.

1247
01:38:34,958 --> 01:38:36,823
He's the head of a drug ring.

1248
01:38:37,708 --> 01:38:39,869
His car is in the back, loaded with drugs.

1249
01:38:40,458 --> 01:38:41,789
He's the one you should arrest,

1250
01:38:42,292 --> 01:38:43,327
not me.

1251
01:38:43,958 --> 01:38:46,870
I only see that you've
intentionally attacked him

1252
01:38:46,875 --> 01:38:48,240
and are trying to frame him.

1253
01:38:48,792 --> 01:38:49,998
He said

1254
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,831
you not only assaulted this person,

1255
01:38:51,833 --> 01:38:53,164
but framed him.

1256
01:38:53,167 --> 01:38:54,282
We must arrest you.

1257
01:38:54,292 --> 01:38:55,292
Cuff him!

1258
01:38:57,125 --> 01:38:58,456
This is outrageous!

1259
01:38:58,958 --> 01:39:01,916
They were both fighting,
why only arrest one?

1260
01:39:02,333 --> 01:39:04,039
Why don't you arrest the drug dealer?

1261
01:39:04,042 --> 01:39:05,657
Did he pay you?

1262
01:39:09,708 --> 01:39:11,869
I don't know what you are talking about.

1263
01:39:11,875 --> 01:39:13,661
I'm just here to keep the peace.

1264
01:39:14,125 --> 01:39:16,491
You're all accused of an illegal assembly

1265
01:39:16,708 --> 01:39:18,539
and disrupting public order.

1266
01:39:18,792 --> 01:39:21,204
Go home now! There's nothing more to see.

1267
01:39:22,042 --> 01:39:23,703
I'll arrest you all.

1268
01:39:23,792 --> 01:39:26,864
You...

1269
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:29,706
Beat them up!

1270
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,410
Beat those dogs!

1271
01:40:08,750 --> 01:40:10,706
In the car behind the restaurant.

1272
01:40:10,875 --> 01:40:12,115
We found all these drugs!

1273
01:40:12,125 --> 01:40:13,535
We have witnesses and evidence.

1274
01:40:13,542 --> 01:40:15,078
He's a drug dealer!

1275
01:40:16,875 --> 01:40:19,161
What are you doing?

1276
01:40:19,167 --> 01:40:21,032
I'm being a policeman.

1277
01:40:21,042 --> 01:40:22,782
You covered up for him.

1278
01:40:22,792 --> 01:40:24,077
Arrest him!

1279
01:40:28,083 --> 01:40:30,039
Even you want to cover for him?

1280
01:40:35,958 --> 01:40:37,289
Take your hands off of me!

1281
01:40:37,708 --> 01:40:39,073
I'm your commanding officer.

1282
01:40:39,083 --> 01:40:42,575
Good, that's right...

1283
01:40:45,792 --> 01:40:47,532
You haven't got the authority to do this!

1284
01:40:47,542 --> 01:40:48,577
Let go of me!

1285
01:40:48,583 --> 01:40:49,698
Take him! Yes sir!

1286
01:40:49,708 --> 01:40:51,619
I'll speak to the commissioner.

1287
01:40:58,792 --> 01:41:00,908
He's getting away!

1288
01:42:02,250 --> 01:42:03,581
Papa,

1289
01:44:12,125 --> 01:44:14,616
Bullying people again?

1290
01:44:16,792 --> 01:44:18,999
What? You want more?

1291
01:44:34,458 --> 01:44:37,530
I told you my papa is the
master of wing chun.

1292
01:44:38,833 --> 01:44:39,948
We should learn wing chun.

1293
01:44:39,958 --> 01:44:41,494
Yes. Wing chun is awesome.
