1
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,499
Mm-mmm.

2
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,372
You're alive.

3
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,803
What are you dreaming,
little angel?

4
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,025
Well...

5
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:23,614
Try again.

6
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,325
Well, that's the best
I can do for now.

7
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,860
I'm really grateful, Doc.

8
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,704
I'll be getting some overtime
next week.

9
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,038
Yeah, pay me when you can.

10
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,790
Here,
I got these for you.

11
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:35,793
My wife works out
at Farm 22.

12
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,169
Thank you.

13
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,463
See you next time.

14
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,586
Keep getting paid in fruit,

15
00:05:41,686 --> 00:05:43,384
and we'll be picking
these ourselves.

16
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,472
Hello, sleepyhead.

17
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:51,767
Hi.

18
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,395
How do you feel?

19
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,648
Okay.

20
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,400
Any pain anywhere?

21
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:01,110
No.

22
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,738
Numbness?
No.

23
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,699
Motor dysfunction?

24
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,702
I'm a little hungry.

25
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,245
Eat this.

26
00:06:11,912 --> 00:06:13,289
Get your sugar levels up.

27
00:06:20,921 --> 00:06:23,090
Taste receptors are working.

28
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,343
Thank you.

29
00:06:25,926 --> 00:06:29,221
You'll like this a whole lot
better with the peel off.

30
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,141
I don't mean to be rude...

31
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,560
but am I supposed
to know you?

32
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,312
Actually...

33
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:38,272
we haven't met.

34
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,609
I'm Dr. Dyson Ido.
This is Nurse Gerhad.

35
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,030
And do you know who I am?

36
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,909
Well, we were hoping...

37
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,911
you'd fill in that part.

38
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,321
Since you're
a total replacement cyborg...

39
00:06:54,421 --> 00:06:57,208
and most of your cyber body
was destroyed...

40
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,001
we can't find any records.

41
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:03,506
But your very human brain
was miraculously intact.

42
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,259
Theoretically, you should
remember something.

43
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,929
Oh. Well...

44
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,057
It's still pretty blank.

45
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,478
No, it's completely blank,
actually.

46
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,567
I don't even
know my own name.

47
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,658
Let's look at the bright side.

48
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,911
Your tears are working.

49
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,590
Mmm.

50
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:50,010
That's so good.

51
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,512
What do you call this?

52
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:20,166
Yeow! What's that?

53
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:22,368
Zalem.
Oh!

54
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,712
The last of
the great sky cities.

55
00:08:26,922 --> 00:08:30,176
What holds it up? Magic?
No.

56
00:08:30,342 --> 00:08:33,179
Something stronger.
Engineering.

57
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,229
And down here,
we have Iron City.

58
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,814
With all its charm.

59
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,817
Dr. Dyson Ido. That's you.

60
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:50,404
While I'm learning names,
do you have one for me?

61
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,448
Alita.

62
00:08:57,077 --> 00:08:58,078
It's a nice name.

63
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,414
I love it.

64
00:09:00,956 --> 00:09:01,957
Can I keep it?

65
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,835
At least until I can
remember my real name?

66
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,545
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.

67
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,006
Okay.

68
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,509
Do you want to take a look?
Yes.

69
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,766
Why are there
so many languages?

70
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,218
Um, after the big war
I told you about...

71
00:09:21,318 --> 00:09:22,310
The Fall.

72
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,897
After The Fall,
only Zalem was left...

73
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,942
and survivors came here
from all over the world.

74
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,320
Everybody down here
works for Zalem.

75
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,531
The Factory, the Farms...

76
00:09:33,697 --> 00:09:35,199
Does anyone ever
go up to Zalem?

77
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,362
We should go.

78
00:09:36,462 --> 00:09:38,202
Nobody from down here
ever goes up.

79
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,787
It's a rule
that's never broken.

80
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,622
What?

81
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,380
Oh!
And he takes him down hard!

82
00:09:49,713 --> 00:09:51,090
What is that?

83
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:53,676
It's Motorball.

84
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,678
That's so cool.

85
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:59,014
Nothing you need to be
wasting your time watching.

86
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,783
Alita.

87
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:20,369
One minute, please.

88
00:10:27,334 --> 00:10:28,377
Hi.

89
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,171
Hello.

90
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,173
You want some?

91
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,425
Here you go.

92
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,430
Can I hug you?

93
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,806
Hi.

94
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,329
Step aside.

95
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,664
Out of the way.

96
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,263
Outstanding.

97
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,518
Why don't you watch
where you're going?

98
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,648
I gotta admit...

99
00:11:30,814 --> 00:11:33,484
I never saw anybody
challenge a Centurion before.

100
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,280
Whoa. You're heavy.

101
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:39,949
I mean...

102
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,034
Oh.

103
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,577
You're a cyborg.

104
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,623
Sorry, I was just
admiring your hand.

105
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,000
Can I see?

106
00:11:56,256 --> 00:11:57,257
Wow.

107
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,260
It's really nice work.

108
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,180
Did Doc Ido do it?

109
00:12:03,847 --> 00:12:05,474
He built all of me.

110
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:08,560
Except my core. That's mine.

111
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,188
Well, he did
a really great job.

112
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,109
Hey, what are those things?

113
00:12:15,275 --> 00:12:16,527
The Centurions?

114
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:19,488
What planet are you from?

115
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,532
Ido found me
in the Scrapyard.

116
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,742
The Scrapyard?
Mm-hmm.

117
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,452
But that would mean...

118
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:26,829
Hey, Doc.

119
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,331
I got those driver-boards
you were looking for.

120
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,867
Alita is new here.

121
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:33,419
She's still learning
about things.

122
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:34,837
I gotta go.

123
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,255
I'll drop those off later.

124
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,757
I need a rebuild
on a quad servo.

125
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,676
Maybe I'll see you around.

126
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,139
Who is that?

127
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:46,932
Hugo.

128
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,227
He's a hard worker, but...

129
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,354
Alita, come on,
let's go home.

130
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,238
Hugo.
Let's go home.

131
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,723
There's the damn Jackers

132
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:20,192
that ripped me to shreds
standing right there.

133
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:24,029
And that vale madre Centurion
wouldn't lift a finger.

134
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,448
Why would anyone wanna
take your arms and legs?

135
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:27,616
Torque coupling.

136
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,663
Those Jackers want your parts
for the black market.

137
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:35,207
To supply the Motorball games.

138
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,625
You were lucky.

139
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:40,212
Another girl was murdered
last night, right near there.

140
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,715
Yeah, I heard that guy
carves girls up...

141
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:45,384
and sells their body parts.

142
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,597
Sorry, Doc.

143
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,011
For now, I don't want you
out after dark.

144
00:14:53,111 --> 00:14:54,111
Is that understood?

145
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,394
Okay.

146
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,929
And if you go out
during the day,

147
00:14:58,029 --> 00:14:59,848
don't wander too far
from this neighborhood.

148
00:14:59,948 --> 00:15:00,948
Okay.

149
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,062
Promise?

150
00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:03,360
I promise.

151
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,873
Hey, kid.

152
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:31,597
Hey, what's your problem?

153
00:15:45,652 --> 00:15:46,862
Who's the girl?

154
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,324
My new assistant.

155
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:55,370
I was surprised to see her
in our daughter's body.

156
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,457
You were supposed to have
destroyed that years ago.

157
00:16:01,084 --> 00:16:03,128
I couldn't.
Clearly.

158
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,841
And did you tell her
who you built that body for?

159
00:16:11,386 --> 00:16:13,680
Our daughter is dead, Chiren.

160
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,724
You need to let it go.
Oh.

161
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,977
It's obviously not me that's
clinging to something here.

162
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,785
Over here!

163
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,383
Hugo.
Hey, Alita.

164
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:50,759
Is this Motorball?

165
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,678
It's just a scrimmage.

166
00:16:52,844 --> 00:16:54,054
Do you wanna join in?

167
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,766
Come on, every kid's
gotta play Motorball.

168
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:01,144
Sure, why not?

169
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,355
I want us
to be a team again.

170
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,441
I have a great new setup...

171
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,777
and equipment...

172
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,904
worthy of your skills.

173
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,441
Together, we can build
the finest champions

174
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,867
this game has ever seen.

175
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,287
Could be my ticket home.

176
00:17:18,453 --> 00:17:21,331
When are you going to realize
there is no way back?

177
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,874
It just does not happen.

178
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,084
Vector can make it happen.

179
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,044
I can't believe
you trust Vector.

180
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,380
He has very high connections.

181
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,718
I won't help you
build monsters.

182
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,602
I'm going to get back
to Zalem somehow.

183
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:47,065
I'll claw my way there with
my bare hands if I have to.

184
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,003
Hey, everyone,
this is Alita.

185
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,876
Hi.

186
00:18:10,976 --> 00:18:12,758
Best way to learn
is to go in.

187
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,686
Pass the ball!

188
00:18:29,786 --> 00:18:31,026
That's it.

189
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,778
Lean into your turns,
look for an opening.

190
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,906
I think I'm getting it!

191
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,663
You can let go
of the remote now.

192
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:47,042
Oh, crap.

193
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,218
Come on, get her!
Come on, get her!

194
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,419
Cut her off!

195
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:58,762
Koyomi, pass her the ball.

196
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,431
And she got it! She got it!

197
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,559
Get her!

198
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,483
Sorry, princess.

199
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:13,935
Nice, Tanji, thanks.

200
00:19:14,035 --> 00:19:15,862
She's never played before.

201
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,451
Sorry.

202
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,798
Got this!

203
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:35,966
Mine!

204
00:19:43,723 --> 00:19:44,766
You got me!

205
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,159
Good shot.

206
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,916
Your freak girlfriend's got
some serious malfunctions.

207
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,334
I'm really sorry.

208
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,170
She humiliated you
so severely.

209
00:20:15,755 --> 00:20:17,424
All right,
I'll see you tonight.

210
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,093
And, uh,
she's not my girlfriend.

211
00:20:21,761 --> 00:20:22,762
Whatever.

212
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,605
You've got some talent
for this game.

213
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,182
I've got to get home now.

214
00:20:34,282 --> 00:20:36,193
Ido wants me in the house
before dark.

215
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,906
Do you want a ride?

216
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:48,363
So you can't
remember anything?

217
00:20:48,463 --> 00:20:49,664
I'm trying to.

218
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,834
Family, friends,
favorite food?

219
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,253
Nothing. Well, maybe oranges.

220
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,713
But that's just
since yesterday.

221
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,590
Oranges?
Uh-huh.

222
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,550
Nope. Unacceptable.

223
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,428
Here, check this out.

224
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,181
Thank you very much, Senora.

225
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:10,852
And here you go.

226
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,187
Thank you.

227
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,522
You ready?

228
00:21:13,688 --> 00:21:14,689
Try this.

229
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,149
Trust me.

230
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,652
It's chocolate.

231
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:24,903
Mmm.

232
00:21:25,003 --> 00:21:26,785
That is so great.
It's good, right?

233
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,697
I have a favorite food now.

234
00:21:30,797 --> 00:21:32,055
Thank you.
This is my favorite food.

235
00:21:32,155 --> 00:21:33,145
Well, I wouldn't
call it that.

236
00:21:33,245 --> 00:21:34,197
I would.

237
00:21:34,297 --> 00:21:36,211
Hey, look. Check it out.

238
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,547
It's a Hunter-Warrior.

239
00:21:38,713 --> 00:21:41,716
He's a bounty hunter.
Named Zapan.

240
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:43,760
Scanning for his mark.

241
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,222
I wouldn't wanna be that guy.

242
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,600
Look at that sword.

243
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,603
All guns are outlawed
in Iron City.

244
00:21:54,437 --> 00:21:56,106
Punishable by death.

245
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,527
Anything that
challenges Zalem.

246
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,887
Didn't I tell you to be home
before dark?

247
00:22:28,471 --> 00:22:31,182
What's the big deal?
I just lost track of time.

248
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:34,561
Yeah. Don't trust anyone.

249
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,814
People do terrible things
to each other here.

250
00:22:38,773 --> 00:22:40,191
What happened to your arm?

251
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,484
Here, eat this.

252
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:42,736
You okay?

253
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,369
You still need proper
nourishment for your brain.

254
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:55,957
You have any chocolate?

255
00:23:01,087 --> 00:23:02,088
It's a harsh world.

256
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,841
The strong prey
on the weak down here.

257
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,469
You gotta stay focused
on your dream.

258
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,138
What's your dream?

259
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,806
I'll show you.

260
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,495
This is my secret place.

261
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:35,997
Best view in town.

262
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,461
Wow.

263
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,339
Really cool.

264
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,591
No. Look.

265
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,593
That view.

266
00:23:49,969 --> 00:23:50,970
Oh.

267
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,847
Right.

268
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,814
I wonder
what it's like up there.

269
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,402
Better than this dump
down here.

270
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,655
Listen.

271
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:15,245
It's stuff from the Factory
going up to Zalem.

272
00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:20,208
But the tubes are just
for cargo, not for people.

273
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,077
If I was as strong as you,

274
00:24:23,177 --> 00:24:25,338
I'd climb that tube
to Zalem right now.

275
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,048
They don't let anybody
up there.

276
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,384
Yeah, that's what they
want you to think.

277
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,927
You just gotta know
the right people.

278
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,847
I happen to be connected.
Oh.

279
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,060
You gotta be willing
to do what it takes.

280
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,732
Whatever it takes.

281
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,778
Funny thing is,
you've seen it.

282
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,072
You just can't remember.

283
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,991
What do you mean?

284
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,454
Doc found you
in the Scrapyard.

285
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:02,000
All that stuff is dumped
from Zalem.

286
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,794
So you must be from up there.

287
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,593
I guess so.

288
00:25:13,052 --> 00:25:15,263
If you could just tell me
what those eyes have seen.

289
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,765
I wish I could.

290
00:25:16,931 --> 00:25:18,933
I keep trying to
remember, but...

291
00:25:19,934 --> 00:25:21,936
It's still a blank.

292
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:25,356
I'm starting to feel
like I wasn't very important.

293
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:27,975
Just an insignificant girl

294
00:25:28,075 --> 00:25:30,111
thrown out with
the rest of the garbage.

295
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,215
No! Stop!
Alita!

296
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,383
Don't do it!

297
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,302
Oh, no.

298
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,137
It's a trap.

299
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,765
Looking for me, Doctor?

300
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,562
Or should I say,
Hunter-Warrior?

301
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,188
"Hunter-Warrior"?

302
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,570
Oh, no.

303
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,781
Looks like he's got us.

304
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,285
Don't move.

305
00:27:44,203 --> 00:27:45,914
Hey, thanks for
bringing a girl.

306
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,291
That's gonna save us
some time.

307
00:28:01,804 --> 00:28:05,725
Nice shot, for a Meat-Boy.

308
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,153
No!

309
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,865
You came to rescue me?

310
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,535
That is so sweet.

311
00:28:27,246 --> 00:28:28,665
You have nice eyes.

312
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,043
He's mine.
You can have the girl.

313
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,622
So long as I get his eyes.

314
00:28:36,722 --> 00:28:37,722
Alita, run!

315
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,275
My God.

316
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:00,363
Rip that flea!

317
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,329
You are so beautiful.

318
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:14,127
I wanna rip you open
and see if you're ugly inside.

319
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,422
Like the others.

320
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:38,192
Watch her die.

321
00:30:22,236 --> 00:30:24,197
Come here, little flea...

322
00:30:24,363 --> 00:30:26,616
so I can pinch
your head off.

323
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,052
Hi-yah!

324
00:30:53,976 --> 00:30:54,977
99!

325
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,604
On your left!

326
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:03,194
Hi-yah!

327
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,459
You'll pay, little flea.

328
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:20,378
Grewishka does not forget.

329
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,421
I'm coming for you.

330
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,467
Both.

331
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,353
Grewishka does not forget!

332
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,568
When I was fighting,
I remembered something.

333
00:31:43,734 --> 00:31:45,486
I was in a huge battle.

334
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,238
You surprised me.

335
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,031
Well,
you surprised me, too.

336
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:52,326
Before The Fall...

337
00:31:52,743 --> 00:31:55,288
there were police
to stop criminals.

338
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:59,458
Now, the Factory pays us
to do the dirty work.

339
00:32:01,043 --> 00:32:04,088
Hunter-Warrior 17739.

340
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,465
You are a Hunter-Warrior.

341
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,471
You stay here.

342
00:32:13,472 --> 00:32:14,765
Don't kill anyone.

343
00:32:45,796 --> 00:32:49,008
Bounty for the cyborg Nyssiana
was 20,000 credits.

344
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,806
You should've told me
who you really are.

345
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,934
And do you do it
for the money?

346
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,435
I take the money.

347
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:02,980
Otherwise the clinic
would've closed long ago.

348
00:33:03,522 --> 00:33:04,890
I do this work
for other reasons

349
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:05,990
I'd rather not talk about.

350
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,277
You have to talk about it.

351
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,446
Something during the fight
triggered a memory.

352
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,157
I was on the moon.

353
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:16,285
You know more about me
than you're saying.

354
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,996
Whose body is this?

355
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,624
Who am I?

356
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,761
This was your daughter?

357
00:33:37,556 --> 00:33:39,225
You built this body for her?

358
00:33:40,726 --> 00:33:42,019
Her name was Alita.

359
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,889
She was really looking forward
to waking up

360
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:46,524
with legs that could run.

361
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,697
You built her
a pair of fast legs.

362
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,618
She never got to use them.

363
00:33:58,744 --> 00:34:00,538
She was murdered.

364
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,416
What happened?

365
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,703
A patient of mine
came to the clinic one night,

366
00:34:07,803 --> 00:34:09,171
looking for drugs.

367
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:13,092
I was a tuner
for the Motorball games...

368
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:17,179
and I had made a machine body
for him of obscene strength.

369
00:34:21,475 --> 00:34:24,562
He was my demon,
coming back to me.

370
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,814
Hey! What are you doing there?

371
00:34:40,911 --> 00:34:43,331
Alita couldn't get out
of the way fast enough.

372
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,493
Her mother, Chiren,

373
00:34:47,593 --> 00:34:49,587
couldn't deal with
Alita's death.

374
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,925
Maybe she just
couldn't deal with me.

375
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,847
So I went hunting.

376
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,726
I needed to kill him.

377
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,939
Maybe I was just hoping
that he would kill me.

378
00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:11,108
It brought no peace.

379
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,235
There were other demons
like him out there...

380
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:17,406
and I felt, somehow, I was
responsible for all of them.

381
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,910
So I registered
as a Hunter-Warrior.

382
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,079
There's nothing noble
about it.

383
00:35:25,247 --> 00:35:27,083
Did you ever find peace?

384
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,003
I found you.

385
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,382
I'm not your daughter.

386
00:35:37,676 --> 00:35:39,095
I don't know what I am.

387
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:41,931
I do.

388
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:44,975
Have a look
at your original Cyber-core.

389
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,437
This is your brain.

390
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:51,732
A normal healthy
teenage girl's brain.

391
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,318
If there is such a thing.

392
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,530
But this is your heart.

393
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,074
Part of your original core...

394
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:04,370
powered by
an Anti-Matter Micro-Reactor.

395
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:07,248
So I've got a strong heart?

396
00:36:07,706 --> 00:36:08,757
You have a heart
strong enough

397
00:36:08,857 --> 00:36:11,419
to power all of Iron City
for years.

398
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,589
This is lost technology.

399
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,758
Nobody's made
this stuff since...

400
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,094
before The Fall.

401
00:36:20,302 --> 00:36:22,096
Yeah, right.

402
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,932
So I'm 300 years old?

403
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,810
Sweetheart, you are.

404
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:47,538
I don't want my players losing
unless I tell them to.

405
00:36:48,914 --> 00:36:51,250
It can't be left to chance.

406
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:53,377
You promised me champions.

407
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,713
And you promised me
the best of everything.

408
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,674
Get those military servos
I asked for.

409
00:36:59,049 --> 00:37:00,718
You don't have
a winning attitude.

410
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,305
Just be ready
for tomorrow's game.

411
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,580
Help me.

412
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,040
Grewishka?

413
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,460
Why should I waste
my talent on you?

414
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:37,129
Look what she's done to me.

415
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,799
Ido's little cyber girl.

416
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,096
What did you say?

417
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:53,729
The woman in my memory
called me 99.

418
00:37:54,813 --> 00:37:58,859
What you saw was a flash
of your previous life.

419
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,778
Who was I?

420
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,488
In time, you'll remember.

421
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,368
I wanna rip her in half.

422
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,412
Grewishka.

423
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,457
Oh, how the mighty
have fallen.

424
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,043
Are we stripping him
for parts?

425
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,753
I need you to
look at something.

426
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,926
It's a Telepresence Chip.
He's wired.

427
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:08,387
Somebody in Zalem
is riding him.

428
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:11,432
There are watchers behind
the eyes all over the city.

429
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,641
Pretty common now.

430
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,310
I'd just as soon remove it...

431
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,186
while I'm rebuilding him.

432
00:39:16,353 --> 00:39:17,513
Why are you wasting time

433
00:39:17,613 --> 00:39:19,523
on this burnt-out
street junk?

434
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,983
It's a personal matter.

435
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,694
Do you like your job, Vector?

436
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,522
If you like your position

437
00:39:26,622 --> 00:39:28,657
and the many comforts
that come with it...

438
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:32,745
I strongly suggest
you listen to Dr. Chiren.

439
00:39:34,788 --> 00:39:35,873
Nova.

440
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,500
My apologies.

441
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,378
Who did this to Grewishka?

442
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,714
A little cyborg girl.

443
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:45,832
Though the impact points

444
00:39:45,932 --> 00:39:47,551
are evidence
of extraordinary power...

445
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,171
I don't understand
how she could create

446
00:39:51,271 --> 00:39:52,806
such force
with such a small body.

447
00:39:53,807 --> 00:39:57,144
It was not the power
of the body that did this.

448
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,520
It was the mind.

449
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:02,733
She knows the fighting
techniques of Panzer Kunst.

450
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,318
Rebuild Grewishka.

451
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,779
Have him bring her to me.

452
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,364
Dead.

453
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,082
He's gone.

454
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,168
Not gone.

455
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,754
Repatched.

456
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,591
You're a clever woman, Doctor.

457
00:40:29,551 --> 00:40:32,429
And determined to reach
your goal at any cost.

458
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,351
So I'll make you this offer.

459
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:40,020
If and when
you have pleased me...

460
00:40:40,854 --> 00:40:43,482
I will grant you
the destiny you seek.

461
00:40:44,274 --> 00:40:45,359
Zalem.

462
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:48,737
You'll send me to Zalem?

463
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,656
I'm there right now.

464
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,868
Consider my services engaged.

465
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,015
There is no bounty
on Grewishka.

466
00:41:17,182 --> 00:41:19,017
But you reported it
to the Factory.

467
00:41:19,893 --> 00:41:21,395
Him killing
all of those women...

468
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,105
Somebody's protecting him.

469
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:24,982
Who has the power to do that?

470
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,611
Someone far beyond us here.

471
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,032
We better stay off
the street for now.

472
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,619
I wanna be
a Hunter-Warrior like you.

473
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,080
Alita, that's impossible.

474
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,665
We could be a team.

475
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,459
Alita, this is dangerous,
dirty work.

476
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:45,002
I know.
No, you don't.

477
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,795
How is that
your choice to make?

478
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:48,714
It's out of the question.

479
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,624
I might need
a life-or-death situation

480
00:41:50,724 --> 00:41:51,925
to remember who I was.

481
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,802
Even if it's just
for a second.

482
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:56,305
Alita, some things are
better left forgotten.

483
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,557
I don't want blood
on these hands, too.

484
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:01,018
Then I'll find out
for myself.

485
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,978
Alita.

486
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,359
I'm just tired of it.

487
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:12,237
He just wants me
to be his perfect little girl.

488
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:15,073
So, you gonna live
by his rules or yours?

489
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,408
What a battle!

490
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:19,578
These two have been going
at each other all match.

491
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,330
Welcome to Motorball.

492
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,380
Jashugan has got the ball.

493
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,675
Claymore attacks!

494
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,721
Jashugan takes him out!

495
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:49,900
Masakus sends Jashugan flying!

496
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,905
Kutty now with the ball,
one point.

497
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,950
Zariki is in hot pursuit.

498
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,544
Wipeout, Zariki!
Whoo!

499
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:15,801
And he throws Kutty
like a rag doll!

500
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,187
Come on.
Let me show you something.

501
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,893
I know all the pit crews
and tuners.

502
00:43:32,993 --> 00:43:34,069
I'll introduce you around.

503
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,698
Who's the top player?

504
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:41,610
Right now, I'd say Jashugan

505
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:43,495
has the best chance
of making Final Champion.

506
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:46,072
Camber's still off
in the left bogie.

507
00:43:46,172 --> 00:43:48,417
I was oversteering
in turn six.

508
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,419
What's Final Champion?

509
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,629
It's the best thing
a Motorball player can win.

510
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:56,008
Every few years, they choose
a player that can't be beaten...

511
00:43:56,174 --> 00:43:57,676
and he gets to go to Zalem.

512
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,461
Hey, Hugo.

513
00:43:59,561 --> 00:44:01,680
Slow is smooth,
smooth is fast.

514
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,390
Do it once, do it right.

515
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,934
Juggernaut needs to pit,
right now.

516
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,061
Do you like to lose?

517
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,897
Then get him in here.

518
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,776
Claymore is a rebuild.
Why is he not tracking?

519
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:18,739
Alita's here.

520
00:44:19,197 --> 00:44:20,782
That's Vector.

521
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,659
He basically runs Motorball.

522
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,745
We do a lot of business
with his team.

523
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,496
Selling parts to him
and his new tuner.

524
00:44:26,663 --> 00:44:27,697
Chiren.

525
00:44:27,797 --> 00:44:29,435
Let's go, guys. Come on,
get me back out there.

526
00:44:29,535 --> 00:44:31,627
What? You're not the only one
with connections.

527
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:35,422
Kutty closing in
on Juggernaut.

528
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,676
Kinuba has Kutty
in his sights.

529
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,765
Oh! Kinuba went through him

530
00:44:53,865 --> 00:44:56,276
like laundry
with those Grindcutters.

531
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,654
Is that weapon even legal?

532
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,618
Kinuba's too strong
with that new weapon.

533
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,662
He's screwing up the odds.

534
00:45:07,537 --> 00:45:08,622
You know...

535
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,667
I could really use
his Grindcutters...

536
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,127
for our other project.

537
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:19,424
Crimson Wind making
her way through the field.

538
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:20,634
So, what do you think?

539
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,472
I like it.

540
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,267
Yo, Hugo. We gotta go.

541
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:31,019
Hey, something's come up.

542
00:45:31,436 --> 00:45:33,188
Where are you going?
I just gotta do something.

543
00:45:33,563 --> 00:45:35,065
Can you get back okay?

544
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,401
Yeah, sure.

545
00:45:38,443 --> 00:45:39,987
Can you go out tomorrow?

546
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:42,278
I wanna show you this place
me and Tanji know.

547
00:45:42,378 --> 00:45:43,782
It's out in the Badlands.

548
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,325
It might help
with your memory.

549
00:45:46,451 --> 00:45:47,661
I'd appreciate that.

550
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:49,579
Thanks.

551
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,248
For everything.

552
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:56,211
Wow!
He is throwing down!

553
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,924
Whoo!

554
00:46:07,597 --> 00:46:08,598
Oh, shit!

555
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:10,892
What the hell?
Shit.

556
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:31,038
Hurry up!

557
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:35,459
You're dead!

558
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:39,671
You little runts!

559
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:41,381
I'm gonna smash your skulls!

560
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,765
You can't do this to me!

561
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,434
Ready.
Give me.

562
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,479
Careful.

563
00:46:55,645 --> 00:46:56,641
You street punks!

564
00:46:56,741 --> 00:46:58,565
I'm gonna
make you pay for this.

565
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:23,673
Nice work.

566
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,468
Compliments to your crew.

567
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:29,471
Thank you, sir.

568
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,351
I'll pass it on.

569
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,186
Hey, man, where's my cut?

570
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:38,109
Hey, when you gonna tell
your hardbody

571
00:47:38,209 --> 00:47:39,170
you jack cyborgs, huh?

572
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:40,565
I'm not.

573
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:41,983
And neither are you.

574
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,444
You afraid
she's gonna cut you loose?

575
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:54,788
Get the Grindcutters
over to Chiren right away.

576
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,581
Use the service gate.

577
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:58,750
Go.

578
00:48:13,306 --> 00:48:14,766
Vector, you prick.

579
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,601
I should've known.

580
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:18,603
What you should've known,
my friend...

581
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,106
is that no one...

582
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:25,068
is greater than the game.

583
00:48:46,047 --> 00:48:47,883
What's outside the city?

584
00:48:48,049 --> 00:48:49,050
Not much.

585
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:50,585
The war
wiped out all utilities

586
00:48:50,685 --> 00:48:52,012
and most everything else.

587
00:48:56,057 --> 00:49:00,228
All we know is the sky cities
fell all in one night...

588
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,514
when the enemy launched
the last attack

589
00:49:02,614 --> 00:49:03,899
with every ship they had.

590
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:06,276
Who was the enemy?

591
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,403
The URM.

592
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:12,741
United Republics of Mars.
The U-R-M.

593
00:49:13,366 --> 00:49:14,362
URM.

594
00:49:14,462 --> 00:49:16,203
On that last night
of the war...

595
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:19,289
the earth shook
and the sky burned.

596
00:49:19,789 --> 00:49:22,751
But in the morning,
Zalem still stood.

597
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:24,711
It's just up ahead.

598
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:34,596
This ship is from
the battle of Zalem.

599
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,596
I figured that
maybe seeing stuff

600
00:49:36,696 --> 00:49:38,141
from the war would
help trigger your...

601
00:49:46,816 --> 00:49:48,101
Salvagers have jacked
some stuff

602
00:49:48,201 --> 00:49:49,402
over the years for metal...

603
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,479
but it's all URM technology,

604
00:49:51,579 --> 00:49:52,781
so it's mostly been
left alone.

605
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,075
This is an URM ship?
Uh-huh.

606
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:56,706
You know, it's pretty hard
to sell this stuff

607
00:49:56,806 --> 00:49:58,236
since no one knows
what it is...

608
00:49:58,336 --> 00:49:59,454
Shh!

609
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,589
We have to go
to the command deck.

610
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,093
It's forward.

611
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:15,220
How does she know that?

612
00:50:15,845 --> 00:50:18,431
Hey, we can't get there.
It's underwater.

613
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,675
How long do you think
she can hold her breath?

614
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,052
I don't know.

615
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:43,743
Oh, this can't be good.

616
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:09,644
Forget it.

617
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:11,688
I won't do it.

618
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:13,189
But...

619
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,483
But you have to.

620
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:17,894
This would help us
fight Grewishka

621
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:19,904
and anyone else
he sends after us.

622
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:22,866
This body...

623
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,119
it has the power I need.

624
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:29,622
I feel a connection to it
I can't explain.

625
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:31,416
This could be who I am.

626
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,785
You've been given
a chance to start over,

627
00:53:33,885 --> 00:53:34,885
with a clean slate.

628
00:53:35,044 --> 00:53:36,296
How many of us get that?

629
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,715
Why did an enemy warship...

630
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:41,885
respond to me?

631
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:43,970
Because I knew that ship.

632
00:53:45,054 --> 00:53:47,056
I've been on others like it,
haven't I?

633
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:49,558
Haven't I?

634
00:53:49,658 --> 00:53:52,937
Whatever you were,
it's not who you are now.

635
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:54,522
No!

636
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:58,610
I'm a warrior, aren't I?

637
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:01,529
And you know.

638
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,073
You've always known.

639
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:11,039
This is called a Berserker.

640
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:17,003
It's a humanoid weapon-system
created by the URM Technarchy.

641
00:54:17,962 --> 00:54:18,958
Your core

642
00:54:19,058 --> 00:54:21,758
was designed to interface
with this type of body.

643
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:26,137
Your identity code
activated it.

644
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:28,556
The instinctive
fighting technique you use...

645
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:35,188
is Panzer Kunst, a lost
combat art for machine bodies.

646
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,357
It was used
by the Berserkers.

647
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:41,861
This is why you're drawn to
conflict without hesitation.

648
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,738
It's part of your training.

649
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:46,908
You are not just
a warrior, Alita.

650
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,862
You're an URM Berserker,

651
00:54:50,962 --> 00:54:54,666
the most advanced
cyborg weapon ever created.

652
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,951
And that is exactly why

653
00:54:57,051 --> 00:55:00,046
I will never unite you
with this body.

654
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:05,385
That's fine.

655
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,388
Fine.

656
00:55:36,749 --> 00:55:37,875
State your business.

657
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,170
I'm here to register
as a Hunter-Warrior.

658
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:49,429
How'd it go?

659
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:56,019
You're a Hunter-Warrior,
all right.

660
00:55:56,185 --> 00:55:57,562
Doc's gonna be pissed.

661
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,314
Whose rules do I live by?

662
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:09,198
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you sure about this?

663
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:11,093
This place is just for
bounty hunters, nobody else...

664
00:56:11,193 --> 00:56:12,368
What do you think this is?

665
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:15,163
Besides, Ido says
I'm drawn to conflict.

666
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:19,834
Oh. I remember you.

667
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:22,378
How's it going, little guy?

668
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,505
Good?

669
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:27,300
Just watch my back.

670
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:30,303
Oh, boy.

671
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,989
Hey, Zapan!
Not the furniture.

672
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,959
What brings you
in here, sweets?

673
00:57:03,252 --> 00:57:04,837
Come to see the Hunters
up close?

674
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:06,339
Not exactly.

675
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:16,391
Cupcake here is
a bounty hunter.

676
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:18,685
What?

677
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:21,262
So, you went down,

678
00:57:21,362 --> 00:57:23,564
you filled out
your application forms...

679
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:25,149
you got your ID badge...

680
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:27,402
and now you're just
like us, yeah?

681
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:29,899
Let me introduce you

682
00:57:29,999 --> 00:57:31,460
to some of your
professional colleagues.

683
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:35,910
This is Master Clive Lee
of the White Hot Palm.

684
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:38,621
He has over
200 confirmed kills.

685
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:40,748
207.

686
00:57:41,457 --> 00:57:43,242
Well, and this is Screwhead,

687
00:57:43,342 --> 00:57:45,878
one of our most lethal
bounty hunters.

688
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:48,965
And then, there's McTeague...

689
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:52,510
the Dogmaster,
with his Hellhounds.

690
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:55,677
His biggest problem is having
enough left to identify after,

691
00:57:55,777 --> 00:57:57,640
so he can collect the bounty.

692
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,646
And then, there's me.

693
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:06,357
Zapan.

694
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:09,360
Keeper of the legendary
Damascus Blade.

695
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:14,991
Honed to a monomolecular edge.
It slices armor like butter.

696
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:19,537
Forged before The Fall by the
lost arts of URM metallurgy.

697
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:21,664
And who did you kill
to acquire it?

698
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:30,131
A Hunter-Warrior
is a solitary predator.

699
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:33,926
You'll be competing against us
for the kill.

700
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:36,220
You can see
what you're up against.

701
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:41,893
Thanks.

702
00:58:45,062 --> 00:58:47,148
I came to ask
for your help...

703
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:50,735
against our common enemy,
Grewishka.

704
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,646
He's being protected
by the system,

705
00:58:53,746 --> 00:58:56,407
and continues
to rampage unchecked.

706
00:58:57,366 --> 00:58:59,327
And now,
he's after Ido and me.

707
00:59:00,369 --> 00:59:02,497
So I'm calling on you...

708
00:59:02,663 --> 00:59:04,957
my Hunter-Warrior brothers.

709
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:07,827
Let's band together

710
00:59:07,927 --> 00:59:10,588
and defeat him
once and for all.

711
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,473
Any takers? Hmm?

712
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:23,017
No?

713
00:59:23,684 --> 00:59:24,852
Big surprise.

714
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:29,482
You know, normally, I wouldn't
take a rookie under my wing...

715
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,526
share my knowledge.

716
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:34,654
I'm willing to make
an exception in your case...

717
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,439
if you'll cut loose
Meat-Boy over here

718
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:37,740
and let me buy you a drink.

719
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,450
Hey, watch it.

720
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:44,455
And what could I learn
from a loudmouth pretty boy...

721
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:46,374
who spends all of his money
on his face?

722
00:59:52,296 --> 00:59:54,832
Maybe I'll pull
your arms and legs off,

723
00:59:54,932 --> 00:59:56,634
roll your head around
in the street.

724
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:59,470
Maybe that'll teach you
some manners.

725
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,640
You might mess up your hair.

726
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:07,311
You gonna take that, Zapan?

727
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,731
He's scared
of the pretty girl.

728
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:12,692
Aah!

729
01:00:35,756 --> 01:00:37,842
You do not deserve
such a weapon.

730
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:43,306
I heard you were
the heroes of Iron City.

731
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,642
I am not impressed.

732
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:47,810
What the hell are you doing?

733
01:00:48,644 --> 01:00:50,396
I'm gonna need you
to stand way back.

734
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:55,985
I will take on anyone
in this room.

735
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:58,738
And if I win...

736
01:00:59,196 --> 01:01:00,948
you fight alongside me.

737
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,161
This bitch broke my nose.

738
01:01:05,661 --> 01:01:06,996
Yes, I did.

739
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:10,333
Heroes?

740
01:01:10,499 --> 01:01:12,960
All I see are junkyard punks,
assorted cyber-trash...

741
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:15,496
and a bunch of drunken
Motorball burnouts

742
01:01:15,596 --> 01:01:17,298
too slow to play the game.

743
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:00,383
Thanks, Hugo.

744
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:13,020
Oh, no.

745
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:27,785
Hold it!

746
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,288
Knock it off!

747
01:02:31,872 --> 01:02:33,708
Or no more free repairs!

748
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,429
I'm with her.

749
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:48,431
Sorry about this.

750
01:02:51,183 --> 01:02:53,102
You and I are going
to have a little talk.

751
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,729
No, we had our talk.

752
01:02:54,895 --> 01:02:56,355
You didn't leave me
another choice.

753
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:16,876
Don't move.

754
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:30,181
It's Grewishka.

755
01:03:30,347 --> 01:03:31,348
What's happened to him?

756
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,102
Well, to answer
your question...

757
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,985
I've had a little upgrade.

758
01:03:52,661 --> 01:03:54,246
I'm only here for the girl.

759
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:57,958
Ah, she's all yours.

760
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:04,048
What about the rest of you?

761
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:05,883
There ain't no bounty
on this guy, Doc.

762
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:08,803
Not our problem.

763
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:16,811
It's all right, Ido.

764
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:23,859
Aw.

765
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:26,570
The only one with courage.

766
01:04:29,281 --> 01:04:30,491
So innocent.

767
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:42,336
Iron City is no place
for innocents, little flea.

768
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:56,016
I do not stand by
in the presence of evil.

769
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:03,482
I do not stand by
in the presence of evil.

770
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:22,877
Come to my world.

771
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:28,048
Come, little flea.

772
01:05:29,049 --> 01:05:30,926
Alita! No!

773
01:05:39,476 --> 01:05:42,771
Welcome to
the underworld. My world.

774
01:05:42,938 --> 01:05:46,942
From here, there are worlds
above worlds above worlds...

775
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:49,612
going farther up
than you can imagine.

776
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:53,157
And the trash of each one
flows down to the one below...

777
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:55,868
'til it all ends up here.

778
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:59,163
It's where I used to live.

779
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:01,457
And it's where
you're going to die.

780
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:33,489
Dance, little flea.

781
01:07:16,323 --> 01:07:18,409
I was forgotten here to rot.

782
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:20,369
But I was saved...

783
01:07:20,869 --> 01:07:21,954
remade...

784
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:25,332
by the same hand that
shapes your destiny even now.

785
01:07:27,167 --> 01:07:28,168
Whose hand?

786
01:07:28,335 --> 01:07:30,879
My master, Nova.

787
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:32,965
What do you know about me?

788
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:06,248
You have the soul
of a survivor.

789
01:08:08,709 --> 01:08:10,586
You'll never give up.

790
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:15,127
Aah.

791
01:08:15,227 --> 01:08:16,592
Know what is hidden.

792
01:08:17,634 --> 01:08:19,261
Always ask...

793
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:22,264
what is it that
you are not seeing?

794
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:24,433
Nova?

795
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:28,354
He is the dragon
that must be slain.

796
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:31,315
Again.

797
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:34,526
Look at you.

798
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:36,612
Where are you going?

799
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:47,081
What's the matter?

800
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:49,291
My little toy doesn't
want to play anymore?

801
01:08:50,834 --> 01:08:52,869
I'll turn you
into a living pendant

802
01:08:52,969 --> 01:08:54,380
to adorn my chest.

803
01:08:55,255 --> 01:08:58,342
Then I can hear your voice
every moment of the day...

804
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:00,594
pleading for mercy!

805
01:09:14,024 --> 01:09:15,526
Hi-yah!

806
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:22,282
Fuck your mercy.

807
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:32,501
No!

808
01:09:57,651 --> 01:09:59,194
Break off!

809
01:10:03,407 --> 01:10:06,952
He wasn't a dog lover.
I hate that.

810
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:11,165
Oh, come on.

811
01:10:16,086 --> 01:10:17,838
I'm sorry.

812
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:20,466
I'm so sorry.

813
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:32,186
You think you can replace us
that easily?

814
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:35,772
Bring her back
as many times as you like.

815
01:11:11,808 --> 01:11:13,977
No one will dare
harm you again.

816
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:32,663
It's the adaptive technology
of the Berserker body.

817
01:11:35,123 --> 01:11:36,783
The shell is reconfiguring

818
01:11:36,883 --> 01:11:39,127
to her subconscious image
of herself.

819
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:43,882
I've never seen
anything like it.

820
01:11:44,424 --> 01:11:48,095
It's making micro-adjustments
throughout every system.

821
01:11:53,016 --> 01:11:55,143
Looks like she's a little
older than you thought.

822
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:18,083
Well, look at you.

823
01:12:40,188 --> 01:12:42,357
Well, you were right.

824
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:44,901
A warrior's spirit needs
a warrior's body.

825
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:59,124
It draws in air,
generating an arc plasma...

826
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:01,418
but how you control it,
I don't know.

827
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:04,296
Didn't exactly
come with a manual, did you?

828
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:06,006
It's some kind of weapon.

829
01:13:14,264 --> 01:13:15,974
Now you know who you are.

830
01:13:25,442 --> 01:13:27,319
But that's just a shell.

831
01:13:28,695 --> 01:13:30,864
It's not bad or good.

832
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:33,659
That part's up to you.

833
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:46,672
Check these out.

834
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:49,091
Pretty fresh, right?

835
01:13:55,347 --> 01:13:56,348
Alita!

836
01:14:00,018 --> 01:14:01,019
Wow.

837
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:03,230
You're...

838
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:06,274
Back together?
Very back together.

839
01:14:09,444 --> 01:14:10,779
You look...

840
01:14:11,488 --> 01:14:12,489
different.

841
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:13,990
It's all nanotech.

842
01:14:14,157 --> 01:14:16,118
It's a bunch of stuff even
Ido hasn't figured out yet.

843
01:14:16,284 --> 01:14:18,120
So are you stronger
than you were?

844
01:14:18,286 --> 01:14:19,955
Yeah. And faster, too.

845
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:22,290
It feels...

846
01:14:23,291 --> 01:14:24,501
more me.

847
01:14:28,755 --> 01:14:29,873
You know,
some guys might be

848
01:14:29,973 --> 01:14:31,116
intimidated by
a girl like you.

849
01:14:31,258 --> 01:14:32,300
Really? Why is that?

850
01:14:32,467 --> 01:14:34,002
'Cause you could
rip my arm off

851
01:14:34,102 --> 01:14:35,178
and beat me
with the wet end.

852
01:14:37,013 --> 01:14:39,599
Well, then,
don't piss me off.

853
01:14:40,892 --> 01:14:42,352
Why don't you like her?

854
01:14:43,478 --> 01:14:46,189
I just never got
the whole hardbody thing.

855
01:14:46,356 --> 01:14:47,899
And besides, she's URM.

856
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:50,360
It means she was probably
the enemy at one point.

857
01:14:50,527 --> 01:14:53,989
Yeah, 300 years ago.

858
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:55,365
Get over it.

859
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:00,495
I'm a lot more
touch sensitive, too.

860
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,498
A lot higher density
of force feedback and...

861
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,293
texture sensors.

862
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:10,005
You wanna try it?

863
01:15:18,138 --> 01:15:19,139
You can feel this?

864
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:20,766
Yes.

865
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:27,105
Close your eyes.

866
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:29,649
Close your eyes.

867
01:15:36,448 --> 01:15:38,033
How about this?

868
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:39,743
Yes.

869
01:15:44,748 --> 01:15:46,041
Where am I now?

870
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:48,960
You're...

871
01:15:51,379 --> 01:15:52,422
with me.

872
01:16:11,399 --> 01:16:13,401
Does it bother you...

873
01:16:14,694 --> 01:16:16,696
that I'm not completely human?

874
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:21,368
You are the most human person
I have ever met.

875
01:16:37,384 --> 01:16:39,461
He won't even let me
fix his eye.

876
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:40,887
He says he wants the pain.

877
01:16:47,352 --> 01:16:48,353
Enough.

878
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:55,610
Nova.

879
01:17:01,032 --> 01:17:02,492
You have failed me.

880
01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:06,538
Stand.

881
01:17:10,458 --> 01:17:13,962
You will never triumph until
you understand what she is.

882
01:17:14,546 --> 01:17:16,381
She's the last of her kind.

883
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:18,925
The finest weapon
of the URM Technarchy.

884
01:17:20,343 --> 01:17:22,554
I need you to destroy
this Alita.

885
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:25,140
I need you to bring me
her heart.

886
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:29,644
I live only for her death.

887
01:17:38,528 --> 01:17:39,988
I hate
when he does that.

888
01:17:44,242 --> 01:17:46,286
This is not a man
who tolerates failure.

889
01:17:48,121 --> 01:17:51,207
I'm not trusting my future
to a piece of iron.

890
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:53,335
What do you have in mind?

891
01:18:02,969 --> 01:18:04,095
To dreams.

892
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:09,684
I like your drive, Hugo.

893
01:18:09,851 --> 01:18:12,103
You have a solid future
with my team.

894
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:15,482
My future's in Zalem.

895
01:18:16,441 --> 01:18:18,109
I remember your promise
every day.

896
01:18:19,402 --> 01:18:20,487
To send me up.

897
01:18:21,571 --> 01:18:23,239
When I get you
a million credits.

898
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:25,325
Personally...

899
01:18:26,576 --> 01:18:29,621
I'd rather rule in hell
than serve in heaven.

900
01:18:32,707 --> 01:18:34,742
We'd be at the bottom
of the food chain up there,

901
01:18:34,842 --> 01:18:36,169
but down here...

902
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:39,464
we can live like kings.

903
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:43,301
So...

904
01:18:44,094 --> 01:18:46,262
Tell me about
this friend of yours.

905
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:48,431
Alita?

906
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:50,016
Is that her name?

907
01:18:50,183 --> 01:18:52,018
Alita. Hmm.

908
01:19:07,617 --> 01:19:08,618
Hi.

909
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:10,870
Hi.

910
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:17,544
What happened to you?

911
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:20,463
I wound up hanging out
with Vector.

912
01:19:21,756 --> 01:19:23,466
Some alcohol was involved.

913
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:25,885
Apparently.

914
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:28,430
So, Vector?

915
01:19:28,596 --> 01:19:30,682
Is that your connection
for getting into Zalem?

916
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:32,851
Yeah.

917
01:19:33,309 --> 01:19:34,310
Oh.

918
01:19:35,478 --> 01:19:37,355
I was hoping maybe
you'd wanna stay.

919
01:19:38,356 --> 01:19:41,234
Hey, it's not right away.

920
01:19:42,485 --> 01:19:44,404
I still gotta raise
the rest of the money first.

921
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:45,655
It's okay.

922
01:19:47,198 --> 01:19:48,742
It's your dream.

923
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:51,494
I know it's what
you've always wanted.

924
01:19:54,706 --> 01:19:55,707
You know...

925
01:19:57,792 --> 01:19:59,085
I was always so sure.

926
01:20:02,255 --> 01:20:03,548
Now you come along...

927
01:20:05,633 --> 01:20:07,177
nothing's clear anymore.

928
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:25,403
How much more do you need
before you can go?

929
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:29,074
90k.

930
01:20:29,699 --> 01:20:30,742
90k?

931
01:20:31,826 --> 01:20:33,319
I can make that in bounties.

932
01:20:33,419 --> 01:20:34,445
I'll just figure out who has

933
01:20:34,545 --> 01:20:35,699
the highest prices
on their heads...

934
01:20:35,799 --> 01:20:36,765
and then I'll take them out.

935
01:20:36,865 --> 01:20:38,625
No, I can't ask you
to do that for me.

936
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:41,169
I'd do whatever
I had to for you.

937
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:43,963
I'd give you whatever I have.

938
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:45,298
What are you doing?

939
01:20:48,259 --> 01:20:49,886
I'd give you my heart.

940
01:20:51,221 --> 01:20:52,430
Take it.

941
01:20:53,264 --> 01:20:55,383
It's got an URM Micro-Reactor
for a power supply,

942
01:20:55,483 --> 01:20:56,976
probably worth millions.

943
01:20:57,143 --> 01:20:58,853
With your connections,
you can find a buyer...

944
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:01,064
you could make enough for
both of us to go to Zalem...

945
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:02,677
and then we just find
a cheap replacement...

946
01:21:02,777 --> 01:21:03,777
No.

947
01:21:05,026 --> 01:21:07,862
Come on, you buy
and sell parts all day long.

948
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:12,158
Don't just do things
for people.

949
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:15,445
No matter how good
you think they are,

950
01:21:15,545 --> 01:21:17,163
or how deserving they are.

951
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:19,999
It's all or nothing with me.

952
01:21:22,168 --> 01:21:23,586
This is who I am.

953
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:25,964
I know.

954
01:21:28,842 --> 01:21:29,843
It's okay.

955
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:32,303
Put it back.

956
01:21:45,441 --> 01:21:46,860
That was pretty intense, huh?

957
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:51,781
Yeah, that was very intense.

958
01:21:53,741 --> 01:21:54,993
Sorry.

959
01:21:56,828 --> 01:21:58,329
Maybe there's another way.

960
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:02,000
Vector wants you to try out
for Second League.

961
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:03,168
What?

962
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:05,536
You become
a big Motorball star,

963
01:22:05,636 --> 01:22:06,796
make a pile of money...

964
01:22:07,505 --> 01:22:09,007
we can go to Zalem together.

965
01:22:09,465 --> 01:22:10,675
What are you talking about?

966
01:22:10,842 --> 01:22:12,927
I can't be
a pro Motorball player.

967
01:22:13,845 --> 01:22:14,929
Ali...

968
01:22:16,139 --> 01:22:17,390
you could be a champion.

969
01:22:18,683 --> 01:22:19,893
You win this tryout...

970
01:22:20,059 --> 01:22:22,395
every scout will be killing
each other to get to you.

971
01:22:24,564 --> 01:22:25,607
We'll be home free.

972
01:22:26,357 --> 01:22:27,984
Only if you'll be my coach.

973
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:30,309
Well, if that's what it takes.

974
01:22:30,409 --> 01:22:32,238
That's what it takes.

975
01:22:39,537 --> 01:22:41,331
Are you going to kill her?

976
01:22:41,497 --> 01:22:42,498
No.

977
01:22:43,082 --> 01:22:44,542
Much worse.

978
01:22:58,806 --> 01:23:00,225
Ido, can a human love
a cyborg?

979
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:03,394
Why?

980
01:23:03,561 --> 01:23:05,563
Does this cyborg
love a human?

981
01:23:10,026 --> 01:23:11,277
Mm-hmm.

982
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:15,281
A human can love a cyborg...

983
01:23:15,448 --> 01:23:17,270
but you have to keep your mind
on the game, Alita.

984
01:23:18,618 --> 01:23:20,411
It can get very rough
out there.

985
01:23:20,578 --> 01:23:22,497
Even for a tryout.

986
01:23:23,706 --> 01:23:24,791
Try these.

987
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,628
Did you make these for me?

988
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:30,713
Yes.

989
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:35,260
They won't make you
any faster. It's regulation.

990
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:38,429
But at least
they won't fail you.

991
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:44,352
Here's our deal.

992
01:23:45,770 --> 01:23:47,930
You go in there, you race,

993
01:23:48,030 --> 01:23:49,816
you win,
you come back right here.

994
01:23:49,983 --> 01:23:54,612
You wear all of these pads,
especially this one.

995
01:23:56,447 --> 01:23:57,949
I don't need all this crap.

996
01:23:58,116 --> 01:23:59,492
Yes, you do.

997
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:01,995
Remember...

998
01:24:02,161 --> 01:24:04,414
if you wreck this body,
I can't fix it.

999
01:24:04,580 --> 01:24:07,292
This is URM technology.
Yes, I know.

1000
01:24:07,458 --> 01:24:08,784
Now, go find
a place to watch,

1001
01:24:08,884 --> 01:24:10,099
because you're
making me nervous.

1002
01:24:13,172 --> 01:24:14,674
Good luck.

1003
01:24:15,425 --> 01:24:16,676
Bye.

1004
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:35,987
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

1005
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:40,074
You are the scum of the game.

1006
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:42,827
But tonight,
you are handpicked scum.

1007
01:24:43,619 --> 01:24:45,413
Because tonight is not a game.

1008
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:47,498
It is a hunt.

1009
01:24:47,665 --> 01:24:49,917
I'm paying 500,000...

1010
01:24:50,084 --> 01:24:55,131
to the one who kills
the girl called Alita.

1011
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:02,296
Hey.

1012
01:25:02,396 --> 01:25:04,265
Where are you?
The tryout's about to start.

1013
01:25:04,432 --> 01:25:05,850
I'm on my way.

1014
01:25:06,017 --> 01:25:07,894
There's something
I've gotta do first.

1015
01:25:08,061 --> 01:25:09,428
I'm doing this for us,
remember?

1016
01:25:09,528 --> 01:25:10,528
You can't miss it.

1017
01:25:10,688 --> 01:25:12,440
I won't. Trust me.

1018
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:19,113
Please, just stop.

1019
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,490
I didn't do anything to you.

1020
01:25:20,656 --> 01:25:23,242
It's just business.
Nothing personal.

1021
01:25:25,953 --> 01:25:26,996
Tanji, stop!

1022
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:30,625
Using my name?

1023
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:33,753
Man, what's wrong with you?

1024
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:36,672
I can't do this anymore.

1025
01:25:37,882 --> 01:25:39,842
What's the matter? You're
already gone half the time.

1026
01:25:40,134 --> 01:25:41,886
Now you show up
with this line of crap!

1027
01:25:42,303 --> 01:25:43,721
It's the little hardbody,
isn't it?

1028
01:25:44,555 --> 01:25:47,392
Listen, it's over.
Do you understand?

1029
01:25:47,558 --> 01:25:48,559
I'm out.

1030
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:51,854
And if you had any brains,
you'd leave this behind, too.

1031
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:54,816
I'm out.

1032
01:25:55,858 --> 01:25:57,068
For good.

1033
01:25:58,861 --> 01:26:00,897
You should've jacked that
bitch when you had the chance.

1034
01:26:01,572 --> 01:26:03,449
Would've been on your way
to Zalem right now.

1035
01:26:19,215 --> 01:26:20,591
Well, very professional.

1036
01:26:20,758 --> 01:26:22,218
Hey, man,
we don't want any trouble.

1037
01:26:22,385 --> 01:26:25,346
If this is your mark,
we're sorry. He's all yours.

1038
01:26:27,598 --> 01:26:28,850
Hugo.

1039
01:26:29,767 --> 01:26:31,519
Jacking cyborgs.

1040
01:26:31,769 --> 01:26:33,066
Your little girlfriend
might take that

1041
01:26:33,166 --> 01:26:35,064
kind of personally,
don't you think?

1042
01:26:35,398 --> 01:26:36,649
Hmm?

1043
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:38,276
But you know girls.

1044
01:26:39,235 --> 01:26:41,571
She'll probably get all weepy
and forgive you...

1045
01:26:43,197 --> 01:26:44,532
when I show her your head.

1046
01:26:44,991 --> 01:26:46,409
There's no marker out on me.

1047
01:26:53,332 --> 01:26:54,750
There will be.

1048
01:26:55,418 --> 01:26:57,378
Murder pulls
a tight little bounty...

1049
01:26:58,963 --> 01:27:00,590
even with gutter trash
like you.

1050
01:27:00,965 --> 01:27:02,842
I never killed anyone.

1051
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:10,183
You just did.

1052
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:18,983
She thinks
she can punk me, huh?

1053
01:27:23,529 --> 01:27:24,697
Hugo, run!

1054
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:33,391
Next up is
Second League tryouts.

1055
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:36,561
Will the Factory practice team
report to the line?

1056
01:28:44,402 --> 01:28:46,612
The winner tonight will
make it one step closer...

1057
01:28:46,779 --> 01:28:49,699
to qualifying
for the Champions League.

1058
01:28:49,865 --> 01:28:52,577
Well, that is
one tough lineup.

1059
01:28:52,743 --> 01:28:54,787
This is gonna be
one heck of a match tonight.

1060
01:29:03,296 --> 01:29:04,839
That's no Factory team.

1061
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:06,841
What?

1062
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:09,594
These two punks in the back...

1063
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:11,679
there are bounty markers
on them.

1064
01:29:13,723 --> 01:29:16,976
And the other guys,
they are Hunter-Warriors.

1065
01:29:25,943 --> 01:29:29,614
And here comes
tonight's one new prospect.

1066
01:29:30,072 --> 01:29:34,535
Okay, then, folks,
give it up for Alita!

1067
01:29:36,287 --> 01:29:38,331
Hugo brought her right to us.

1068
01:29:38,497 --> 01:29:40,875
What'd you promise him?
Hmm.

1069
01:29:42,585 --> 01:29:44,879
I'm sending him to Zalem,
of course.

1070
01:29:54,972 --> 01:29:57,266
Alita! Alita!

1071
01:30:01,562 --> 01:30:02,605
Hey.

1072
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:04,265
Since there is
only one new prospect...

1073
01:30:04,365 --> 01:30:06,651
What's up?
...there will be no teams.

1074
01:30:06,817 --> 01:30:10,112
The name of the game
is Cut-throat.

1075
01:30:14,992 --> 01:30:16,786
Go easy on me, guys.

1076
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:19,121
Sure, kid.

1077
01:30:19,372 --> 01:30:20,873
No worries.

1078
01:30:24,293 --> 01:30:26,545
Alita!
What are you doing?

1079
01:30:26,712 --> 01:30:28,547
It's a setup.
You gotta get outta there.

1080
01:30:28,714 --> 01:30:30,383
They're gonna kill you!

1081
01:30:33,928 --> 01:30:35,179
Which ones?

1082
01:30:35,346 --> 01:30:36,597
All of them!

1083
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:42,770
Players, 10-second warning.

1084
01:30:49,151 --> 01:30:50,444
Five seconds...

1085
01:31:09,213 --> 01:31:10,539
The new kid, Alita,

1086
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:13,134
takes possession
right off the snap.

1087
01:31:22,101 --> 01:31:26,397
A slow Tuesday night just
got hotter than the playoffs.

1088
01:31:36,907 --> 01:31:39,109
Looks like the fans
have themselves

1089
01:31:39,209 --> 01:31:40,494
an underdog darling...

1090
01:31:40,661 --> 01:31:44,707
with the face of an angel
and a body built for battle.

1091
01:31:52,465 --> 01:31:53,832
Maybe a little Motorball

1092
01:31:53,932 --> 01:31:55,504
will break out
in the middle of this fight.

1093
01:31:55,634 --> 01:31:57,428
Oh, crap.

1094
01:32:08,564 --> 01:32:09,560
Oh! Looks like it's

1095
01:32:09,660 --> 01:32:11,609
"No rules Tuesday"
out there, folks.

1096
01:32:23,954 --> 01:32:26,290
Ouch!
You know that hurts!

1097
01:32:30,669 --> 01:32:34,131
Stinger's got Alita
in a lot of trouble.

1098
01:32:46,018 --> 01:32:48,470
She must've said something
in the locker room

1099
01:32:48,570 --> 01:32:50,606
that these guys did not like.

1100
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:12,503
Number 99...

1101
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:14,338
Alita!

1102
01:33:19,718 --> 01:33:21,303
Ali, it's me.

1103
01:33:22,179 --> 01:33:23,347
I've got a big problem.

1104
01:33:23,514 --> 01:33:25,766
Hugo, this is not a good time.

1105
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:27,643
He's trying to kill me.

1106
01:33:28,394 --> 01:33:29,645
Who's trying to kill you?

1107
01:33:29,812 --> 01:33:31,814
Zapan, the Hunter-Warrior.

1108
01:33:32,690 --> 01:33:34,149
He killed Tanji.

1109
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:35,860
What do you mean?

1110
01:33:36,443 --> 01:33:38,320
Now, he's coming for me.

1111
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:44,401
Not sure our Battle Angel

1112
01:33:44,501 --> 01:33:45,953
can get out of this one.

1113
01:33:47,329 --> 01:33:49,373
Oh, shit. Here he comes!

1114
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:52,246
Where are you?

1115
01:33:52,346 --> 01:33:54,003
I'm headed
to the old church.

1116
01:33:55,170 --> 01:33:57,047
Okay. I'm coming.

1117
01:34:04,972 --> 01:34:07,016
I can't believe it!
Incredible!

1118
01:34:07,474 --> 01:34:09,852
I've never seen
anything like this.

1119
01:35:10,704 --> 01:35:12,831
Hey, I'm almost there.

1120
01:35:12,998 --> 01:35:14,083
Got it.

1121
01:36:16,729 --> 01:36:17,938
Where are you going, huh?

1122
01:36:47,676 --> 01:36:50,262
Looks like your Hugo hasn't
been entirely honest with you.

1123
01:36:52,765 --> 01:36:54,391
Is it true?

1124
01:36:54,767 --> 01:36:55,809
Ali...

1125
01:36:57,186 --> 01:36:58,437
you don't understand.

1126
01:37:03,692 --> 01:37:05,444
I never killed anyone.

1127
01:37:06,570 --> 01:37:08,572
We only jacked parts.

1128
01:37:10,157 --> 01:37:12,785
We paralyzed them
and stripped them, that's all.

1129
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:17,331
I needed the money for Zalem.

1130
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:21,585
Step aside
and let me do my job.

1131
01:37:25,005 --> 01:37:27,257
Touch him again
and I will kill you.

1132
01:37:27,424 --> 01:37:28,542
Interference between

1133
01:37:28,642 --> 01:37:30,511
a licensed Hunter-Warrior
and his kill...

1134
01:37:30,677 --> 01:37:33,555
is a violation of Factory Law
and the Hunter's Code.

1135
01:37:33,722 --> 01:37:35,557
He's mine!

1136
01:37:37,226 --> 01:37:39,103
Then make the kill.

1137
01:37:46,693 --> 01:37:48,654
Come on, Hunter-Warrior.

1138
01:37:50,322 --> 01:37:52,241
Tonight, you become
one of us.

1139
01:37:58,914 --> 01:38:00,323
Mm-mmm.

1140
01:38:00,423 --> 01:38:02,367
You know, there's no room
for love or mercy

1141
01:38:02,467 --> 01:38:03,710
in the Hunter's Code.

1142
01:38:12,469 --> 01:38:14,847
Let me make it easier for you.

1143
01:38:22,396 --> 01:38:23,438
Hugo!

1144
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:32,239
Deliver the criminal Hugo,
Bounty 9107.

1145
01:38:32,406 --> 01:38:34,533
Wanted for the crime
of murder.

1146
01:38:35,492 --> 01:38:37,536
You better finish him
before we do!

1147
01:38:38,078 --> 01:38:40,289
It's Hunter Law!

1148
01:38:47,713 --> 01:38:49,089
I have to get you to Ido.

1149
01:38:49,256 --> 01:38:51,175
No. Centurions.

1150
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:53,919
If you go back out there
with me alive,

1151
01:38:54,019 --> 01:38:55,637
they'll kill us both.

1152
01:38:59,308 --> 01:39:02,269
What did you do?
What did you do?

1153
01:39:04,813 --> 01:39:06,481
I didn't kill that guy.

1154
01:39:08,734 --> 01:39:10,194
But what does it matter?

1155
01:39:12,613 --> 01:39:14,114
I tore people apart.

1156
01:39:15,073 --> 01:39:18,118
People like you, for money.

1157
01:39:20,746 --> 01:39:22,414
Where were you tonight?

1158
01:39:23,123 --> 01:39:25,125
I went to go
stop the others.

1159
01:39:25,459 --> 01:39:27,711
And tell them I quit.
Why?

1160
01:39:29,129 --> 01:39:30,964
Because I love you.

1161
01:39:35,219 --> 01:39:36,845
God, I'm sorry.

1162
01:39:52,361 --> 01:39:53,403
Did you find them?

1163
01:39:54,863 --> 01:39:56,031
No.

1164
01:39:56,907 --> 01:39:58,450
They're gone.

1165
01:40:02,913 --> 01:40:06,124
You're so cold.
Please don't die.

1166
01:40:07,501 --> 01:40:09,044
Please don't.

1167
01:40:17,844 --> 01:40:20,472
I'd give him my life
if I could.

1168
01:40:34,111 --> 01:40:35,696
Maybe you can.

1169
01:40:41,535 --> 01:40:44,070
You have violated Factory Law
and the Hunter's Code

1170
01:40:44,170 --> 01:40:45,622
by protecting a wanted felon.

1171
01:40:47,582 --> 01:40:51,920
Where is the criminal Hugo,
Bounty 9107?

1172
01:40:57,259 --> 01:40:58,302
Hugo is dead.

1173
01:40:58,927 --> 01:41:00,262
I claim the bounty.

1174
01:41:00,595 --> 01:41:03,015
Hunter-Warrior 26651.

1175
01:41:04,558 --> 01:41:06,560
Claim confirmed.

1176
01:41:13,275 --> 01:41:14,276
Ah.

1177
01:41:17,404 --> 01:41:19,156
Yeah, that's a cute trick.

1178
01:41:19,323 --> 01:41:21,616
You think this is
gonna work, huh? Hmm?

1179
01:41:22,951 --> 01:41:25,203
Give me that.

1180
01:41:25,370 --> 01:41:26,830
Violation.

1181
01:41:26,997 --> 01:41:28,915
Hunter-Warrior Zapan...

1182
01:41:29,082 --> 01:41:30,909
stealing another's bounty

1183
01:41:31,009 --> 01:41:33,503
is against Factory Law
and the Hunter's Code.

1184
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:34,880
Thanks.

1185
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,010
My face.

1186
01:41:41,011 --> 01:41:42,429
My... My face!

1187
01:41:43,764 --> 01:41:45,140
My face!

1188
01:41:45,307 --> 01:41:46,641
No!

1189
01:42:01,615 --> 01:42:02,657
How is he?

1190
01:42:10,332 --> 01:42:13,543
This city corrupts
even good people.

1191
01:42:19,466 --> 01:42:20,759
He's good.

1192
01:42:21,259 --> 01:42:22,260
He's stable.

1193
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:32,646
Chiren's surgical technique
was brilliant.

1194
01:42:35,065 --> 01:42:37,109
There's no brain damage.

1195
01:42:44,241 --> 01:42:46,201
Vector was running a scam.

1196
01:42:46,910 --> 01:42:48,995
If you're born on the ground,
you stay on the ground...

1197
01:42:49,162 --> 01:42:51,081
and no amount of money
can change that.

1198
01:42:51,248 --> 01:42:53,959
The only one way to get from
the lower world to Zalem...

1199
01:42:54,126 --> 01:42:56,002
is to become Final Champion.

1200
01:42:56,169 --> 01:42:58,547
You can't buy
your way up there.

1201
01:42:59,005 --> 01:43:00,882
But how do you know that
for sure?

1202
01:43:04,928 --> 01:43:06,096
I was born there.

1203
01:43:08,849 --> 01:43:12,227
I've removed it myself,
the Mark of Zalem.

1204
01:43:14,438 --> 01:43:15,930
With our daughter's illness,

1205
01:43:16,030 --> 01:43:18,733
Chiren and I were forced
to descend here to Iron City.

1206
01:43:19,651 --> 01:43:22,529
And the man responsible
for our exile...

1207
01:43:22,696 --> 01:43:24,981
the watcher
behind the eyes...

1208
01:43:25,081 --> 01:43:26,081
is Nova.

1209
01:43:28,702 --> 01:43:30,829
You had her heart
in your hands...

1210
01:43:32,747 --> 01:43:34,833
and you let her live.

1211
01:43:36,376 --> 01:43:38,086
I did.
Why?

1212
01:43:40,297 --> 01:43:42,090
Because I'm a doctor.

1213
01:43:42,966 --> 01:43:43,967
And...

1214
01:43:46,011 --> 01:43:47,804
I'm a mother.

1215
01:43:49,389 --> 01:43:51,600
And somehow I forgot that.

1216
01:43:54,519 --> 01:43:56,521
I can't do this anymore.

1217
01:43:58,773 --> 01:43:59,983
I'm out.

1218
01:44:03,153 --> 01:44:04,571
Chiren, wait.

1219
01:44:16,082 --> 01:44:17,709
Don't you think
it's time you went to Zalem?

1220
01:44:20,629 --> 01:44:23,381
I could send you
up there right now.

1221
01:44:23,548 --> 01:44:25,675
What I want...

1222
01:44:27,344 --> 01:44:29,346
it isn't up there.

1223
01:44:48,156 --> 01:44:50,283
I have to do something.

1224
01:44:50,951 --> 01:44:52,953
I'll come back for you.

1225
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:57,374
This is my fault.

1226
01:45:00,502 --> 01:45:02,087
This is my fault.

1227
01:45:02,254 --> 01:45:04,548
Don't ever feel sorry
for yourself.

1228
01:45:06,091 --> 01:45:08,260
You're the only one
built for this.

1229
01:45:10,011 --> 01:45:12,055
Thank you, Father.

1230
01:45:30,699 --> 01:45:32,242
Vector!

1231
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:35,787
Hostile intention detected.

1232
01:45:35,954 --> 01:45:37,622
Surrender your weapon.

1233
01:45:46,381 --> 01:45:48,174
Surrender your weapon.

1234
01:46:07,277 --> 01:46:08,695
Security report.

1235
01:46:12,115 --> 01:46:13,491
Violation! Violation!

1236
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:15,619
Violation! Violation!

1237
01:46:20,123 --> 01:46:21,541
Did you get her?

1238
01:46:22,083 --> 01:46:23,376
Security?

1239
01:46:31,134 --> 01:46:34,888
You were never going to send
Hugo to Zalem, were you?

1240
01:46:37,349 --> 01:46:38,725
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1241
01:46:39,434 --> 01:46:41,603
I always keep my promise
to send people up.

1242
01:46:45,523 --> 01:46:47,442
Like Dr. Chiren here.

1243
01:46:49,819 --> 01:46:52,822
Nova demands body parts
for his experiments.

1244
01:46:53,531 --> 01:46:56,159
Especially, the brains
of people he admires.

1245
01:47:00,288 --> 01:47:04,209
And that is the only way
anyone ever gets to Zalem.

1246
01:47:10,256 --> 01:47:11,591
It took you long enough.

1247
01:47:15,387 --> 01:47:17,171
I knew you wouldn't wait
for your fate

1248
01:47:17,271 --> 01:47:18,923
to find you, little flea.

1249
01:47:19,023 --> 01:47:21,226
Get up.

1250
01:47:32,487 --> 01:47:33,947
Defense Ring!

1251
01:48:01,933 --> 01:48:03,184
Finish the mission.

1252
01:48:03,810 --> 01:48:06,229
Destroy Zalem.

1253
01:48:11,526 --> 01:48:14,529
Destroy Zalem.

1254
01:48:28,126 --> 01:48:29,836
I know who my enemy is.

1255
01:48:31,379 --> 01:48:33,173
And I know
he's watching us now.

1256
01:48:35,633 --> 01:48:37,051
And you're just his slave.

1257
01:48:46,227 --> 01:48:48,897
And I'm just
an insignificant girl.

1258
01:49:15,673 --> 01:49:16,674
Speak.

1259
01:49:16,841 --> 01:49:18,968
No. No. No. Wait.

1260
01:49:19,135 --> 01:49:20,131
Speak!

1261
01:49:20,231 --> 01:49:21,966
What do you want me to say?
I will say anything.

1262
01:49:22,066 --> 01:49:23,598
Not you.

1263
01:49:23,765 --> 01:49:24,766
Him!

1264
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:35,985
So we finally meet, Alita.

1265
01:49:37,111 --> 01:49:38,905
Not your real name, of course.

1266
01:49:39,072 --> 01:49:40,156
Nova?

1267
01:49:53,628 --> 01:49:54,629
Where are you?

1268
01:49:55,213 --> 01:49:57,966
Home. As we speak.

1269
01:49:58,132 --> 01:49:59,801
Feet up.

1270
01:50:01,052 --> 01:50:02,048
Well, my girl,

1271
01:50:02,148 --> 01:50:04,556
you've certainly exceeded
my expectations.

1272
01:50:05,223 --> 01:50:07,475
Killing my champion Grewishka.

1273
01:50:07,976 --> 01:50:09,143
Most impressive.

1274
01:50:10,270 --> 01:50:13,481
And turning a selfish creature
like Chiren.

1275
01:50:13,982 --> 01:50:16,109
I didn't see that coming.

1276
01:50:16,359 --> 01:50:20,238
So, when you walk out of here,
the Factory won't stop you.

1277
01:50:21,781 --> 01:50:22,782
This time.

1278
01:50:23,324 --> 01:50:25,910
I don't need
your permission to live.

1279
01:50:26,077 --> 01:50:27,579
Others might.

1280
01:50:28,496 --> 01:50:30,206
Your Dr. Ido, for example.

1281
01:50:31,207 --> 01:50:32,750
And what about Hugo?

1282
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:35,378
He's still alive, isn't he?

1283
01:50:36,170 --> 01:50:37,830
We will track him down.

1284
01:50:37,930 --> 01:50:39,081
Hmm.

1285
01:50:39,181 --> 01:50:41,759
I've found the only way
to enjoy immortality...

1286
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:44,554
is to watch others die.

1287
01:50:46,556 --> 01:50:48,224
You just lost a puppet.

1288
01:50:51,895 --> 01:50:54,606
Well, that looks fatal.

1289
01:50:55,565 --> 01:50:56,649
No matter.

1290
01:50:57,692 --> 01:50:59,652
Vector was getting tiresome.

1291
01:51:02,989 --> 01:51:05,909
You've made the biggest
mistake of your life.

1292
01:51:06,951 --> 01:51:08,369
And what's that?

1293
01:51:09,495 --> 01:51:11,331
Underestimating who I am.

1294
01:51:12,874 --> 01:51:14,834
Then until next time.

1295
01:51:16,377 --> 01:51:17,378
Remember.

1296
01:51:21,549 --> 01:51:23,760
I see everything.

1297
01:51:29,015 --> 01:51:30,099
Alita.

1298
01:51:30,767 --> 01:51:32,685
Factory enforcers came
looking for Hugo.

1299
01:51:32,852 --> 01:51:34,896
Somehow they knew
he'd been kept alive.

1300
01:51:35,063 --> 01:51:37,565
I helped him escape,
but they've sealed the city.

1301
01:51:37,732 --> 01:51:39,776
They're going to find him.
Where is he?

1302
01:51:40,610 --> 01:51:41,861
He's trying to go up.

1303
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:03,925
Hugo!

1304
01:52:04,801 --> 01:52:05,885
Hugo!

1305
01:52:06,844 --> 01:52:07,845
Hugo.

1306
01:52:08,721 --> 01:52:09,889
Hugo!

1307
01:52:10,139 --> 01:52:11,140
Stop.

1308
01:52:11,307 --> 01:52:13,184
You have to come down.
We can't stay up here.

1309
01:52:13,351 --> 01:52:16,104
There's a bounty on me.
This is the only way.

1310
01:52:16,270 --> 01:52:18,731
No, this is dangerous.
We have to get down, now.

1311
01:52:18,898 --> 01:52:20,525
If I go back down there,
I'm dead.

1312
01:52:20,692 --> 01:52:22,527
No. You have to
listen to me, okay?

1313
01:52:22,694 --> 01:52:24,028
I've been right here before.

1314
01:52:24,445 --> 01:52:26,689
This is exactly
where Nova wants you.

1315
01:52:26,789 --> 01:52:28,866
He's using you to get to me.

1316
01:52:29,033 --> 01:52:30,493
Come on,
we have to go back down.

1317
01:52:30,660 --> 01:52:32,412
We belong up there, Alita.

1318
01:52:33,955 --> 01:52:37,083
We don't belong anywhere
except together.

1319
01:52:41,546 --> 01:52:43,047
You'll always be running.

1320
01:52:45,216 --> 01:52:46,342
Together.

1321
01:52:47,927 --> 01:52:49,178
Come with me.

1322
01:52:50,805 --> 01:52:52,015
Please.

1323
01:52:55,018 --> 01:52:56,644
We could be free.

1324
01:53:07,488 --> 01:53:08,865
Okay.

1325
01:53:12,994 --> 01:53:13,995
No!

1326
01:53:20,918 --> 01:53:22,420
No!

1327
01:53:36,225 --> 01:53:37,393
Hold on.

1328
01:53:38,227 --> 01:53:39,437
I got you.

1329
01:53:43,149 --> 01:53:45,276
Okay, okay. Don't move.

1330
01:53:47,070 --> 01:53:48,488
Don't move.

1331
01:53:49,030 --> 01:53:50,948
I'm gonna lift you up slowly.

1332
01:54:08,341 --> 01:54:09,801
Thank you...

1333
01:54:11,177 --> 01:54:12,678
for saving me.

1334
01:54:13,054 --> 01:54:14,263
I love you.

1335
01:54:15,098 --> 01:54:16,099
No!

1336
01:54:24,357 --> 01:54:25,358
No!

1337
01:54:52,635 --> 01:54:54,470
It took her
only a few months...

1338
01:54:54,637 --> 01:54:57,557
to rise through the ranks
of the Second League.

1339
01:54:57,723 --> 01:55:00,718
And tonight,
she makes her first appearance

1340
01:55:00,818 --> 01:55:02,603
in the Champions League.

1341
01:55:02,770 --> 01:55:05,731
Where she has a chance
at becoming Final Champion...

1342
01:55:05,898 --> 01:55:08,317
and going to Zalem.

1343
01:55:36,387 --> 01:55:40,183
Alita! Alita! Alita!

1344
01:55:40,349 --> 01:55:44,437
Let's hear it for
the Battle Angel herself...

1345
01:55:44,604 --> 01:55:46,314
number 99...

1346
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:50,026
Alita!

1347
01:56:29,701 --> 01:56:32,287
Alita! Alita! Alita!
