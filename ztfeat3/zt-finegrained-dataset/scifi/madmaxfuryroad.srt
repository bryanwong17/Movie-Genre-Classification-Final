1
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,814
My name is Max.

2
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,279
My world is fire and blood.

3
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,711
Why are you hurting these people?

4
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,288
It's the oil, stupid.

5
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,999
Oil wars.
We are killing for guzzoline.

6
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:33,921
The world is running out of water.

7
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,911
Now there's the water wars.

8
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,999
Once, I was a cop.

9
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:42,798
A road warrior searching
for a righteous cause.

10
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,643
--to the terminal freak-out point.

11
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,973
Mankind has gone rogue,
terrorizing itself.

12
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,558
Thermonuclear skirmish.

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,972
The earth is sour.

14
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,470
Our bones are poisoned.

15
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,687
We have become half-life.

16
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,565
As the world fell...

17
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,732
each of us, in our own way,
was broken.

18
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,444
It was hard to know
who was more crazy:

19
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,617
Me...

20
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,737
or everyone else.

21
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,578
Hello?

22
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,627
Where are you?

23
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,169
Where are you, Max?

24
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,388
Here they come again.
Max Rockatansky.

25
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,804
Worming their way
into the black matter of my brain.

26
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,052
Help us, Max.
You promised to help us.

27
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,225
I tell myself...

28
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,569
they cannot touch me.

29
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,236
They are long dead.

30
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,169
I am the one...

31
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,510
who runs from both
the living and the dead.

32
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,926
Hunted by scavengers.

33
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:55,475
Haunted by those I could not protect.

34
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,354
So I exist in this wasteland.

35
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:16,406
A man reduced to a single instinct:

36
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,577
Survive.

37
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,070
Max?

38
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,113
Is that you?

39
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,157
Where were you?

40
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,083
Help us. Where were you?

41
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:48,329
Where were you, Max?

42
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,097
Where were you, Max?

43
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:07,723
Stop running.

44
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,522
You let us die!

45
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,438
You let us die!

46
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,904
You let us die!

47
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:15,695
You promised to help us!

48
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:16,941
Why?

49
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,171
Witness!

50
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,594
I got him.

51
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,813
We are War Boys!

52
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,058
War Boys!

53
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,069
Kamakrazee War Boys!

54
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,312
War Boys!

55
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,482
Fucacima kamakrazee...

56
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,029
War Boys!

57
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,243
Hooked on!

58
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,028
Today we're heading...

59
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,497
to Gas Town!

60
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,082
Gas Town!

61
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,326
Today we're hauling Aqua Cola.

62
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,370
Aqua Cola!

63
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,414
Today we're hauling produce!
Produce!

64
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,111
And today we're hauling...

65
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,550
Mother's Milk!

66
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,294
Mother's Milk!

67
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:27,497
Joe! Joe! Joe! Immortan Joe!

68
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,395
Rev it up for the Immortan Joe!

69
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:03,651
Once again, we send off my War Rig
to bring back...

70
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,244
guzzoline from Gas Town...

71
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,239
and bullets from the Bullet Farm!

72
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:13,456
Once again, I salute my Imperator...

73
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,329
Furiosa!

74
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,578
And I salute...

75
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,374
my half-life War Boys...

76
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,968
who will ride with me eternal...

77
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,596
on the highways of Valhalla.

78
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,216
V8! V8! V8! V8!

79
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,093
I am your redeemer.

80
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,687
It is by my hand...

81
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,978
you will rise from the ashes...

82
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,224
of this world!

83
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,820
It's coming. Get ready.

84
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:52,040
Yes. Yes. Yes. It's coming.

85
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,719
Do not, my friends...

86
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,093
become addicted to water.

87
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,936
It will take hold of you...

88
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,140
and you will resent its absence.

89
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,507
Clear off!

90
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,090
Get them all off!

91
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,629
Clear off!

92
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,677
Get them all off.

93
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,763
Get off!

94
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,192
Signal Gas Town. Convoy's on its way.

95
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,377
I got a War Boy...

96
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,379
running on empty.

97
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:13,681
Hook up that full-life.

98
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,934
Hey! Careful. That's a universal donor.

99
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,539
Boss, we're not going to Gas Town?

100
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,459
Bullet Farm?

101
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,501
We're heading east.

102
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,251
I'll pass it down the line.

103
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,382
New orders!

104
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,301
Thunder up! Thunder up!

105
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,010
This is not a supply run!

106
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,007
Go. Go.

107
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,766
Ace, what's going on?
Go. We're heading east.

108
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,389
Why?
I don't know. That's the order.

109
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,330
Hey, Pa.

110
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,122
You know about this?

111
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,547
Your produce ain't going to Gas Town.

112
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,016
She's gone off-road...

113
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,303
into hostile territory.

114
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,631
Why would she do that?

115
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,476
Let me see.

116
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:30,443
Rictus.

117
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,153
I wanna see.
Rictus.

118
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,648
Go see what's agitating Dad.

119
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,226
Splendid!

120
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,104
Angharad!

121
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:17,606
Where are they?

122
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,658
They are not your property.

123
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:20,901
Miss Giddy?

124
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,703
You cannot own a human being.

125
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,161
Sooner or later someone pushes back!

126
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,501
Where is she taking them?

127
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,962
She didn't take them.
They begged her to go!

128
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,507
Where is she taking them?

129
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,547
A long way from you.

130
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:04,029
Hey. Hey, what's happening?

131
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,327
Slit!

132
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,492
What's going on? Slit!

133
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,461
Treason. Betrayal.
An Imperator gone rogue.

134
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:13,374
An Imperator.

135
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,213
Who?

136
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,299
Furiosa! She took a lot of stuff
from Immortan Joe.

137
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,542
What stuff?

138
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,758
Breeders! His prize breeders!

139
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,506
He wants them back!
Not a hand laid on them.

140
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,398
By my deeds I honor him.

141
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,732
V8.

142
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,313
V8! V8! V8!

143
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,487
That's my wheel.

144
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,737
I'm driving.

145
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,780
You're my lancer.

146
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,367
I just promoted myself.

147
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,160
Not today. Today is my day.

148
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,410
Look at you.

149
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,296
If you can't stand up,
you can't do war.

150
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,790
He's right, son.

151
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,212
I'm not staying here dying soft.

152
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,968
You're already a corpse.

153
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,383
I just need a top-up. More juice.
No time!

154
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,177
We take my Blood Bag.

155
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,663
We take my Blood Bag
and strap him to the lancer's perch.

156
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,431
It's got a muzzle on it. It's feral.

157
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,269
That's right.

158
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,730
High-octane crazy blood filling me up.

159
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,810
If I'm gonna die...

160
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,106
I'm gonna die historic
on the Fury Road.

161
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,536
Yeah. Yeah.

162
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:34,035
Organic, hitch up his Blood Bag.
Eh?

163
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:35,499
Right-o.

164
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,178
How much more can they take from me?

165
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,642
They've got my blood.
Now it's my car!

166
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,714
Immortan!

167
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,593
Immortan Joe!

168
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:35,934
He looked at me!

169
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,435
He looked right at me!
He looked at your Blood Bag!

170
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,982
He turned his head.
He looked me in the eye.

171
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,401
He was scanning the horizon.

172
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:45,906
No.

173
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,324
I am awaited.

174
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,952
I am awaited in Valhalla!

175
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,540
Confucamus!

176
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:57,998
Immortan!

177
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,872
Yeah!

178
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,022
Hey! Heads up!

179
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,268
Heads up!

180
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,108
Boss!

181
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,387
We got vehicles from the Citadel.

182
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,612
They're firing flares.

183
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,363
They want reinforcements from Gas Town...

184
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,207
and the Bullet Farm.

185
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,200
What is this?

186
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,793
Backup? Decoy?

187
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,708
It's a detour.

188
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:14,862
Eyes right!

189
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,291
Buzzards!

190
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,457
Buzzards right! Eyes on! Eyes on!
Buzzards right!

191
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,795
Eyes on!
Eyes on!

192
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,635
Should we turn it around
and run them into our backup?

193
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,842
No! We're good!

194
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,050
We fang it!

195
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,517
Thunder up! Here we go!

196
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,439
Prepare the gunners!

197
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,880
Morsov!

198
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,051
Come on, attack!

199
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:33,898
War!

200
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,705
Ready!

201
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,375
She's ours, Slit!

202
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,248
She's ours.

203
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,921
First, we get the Buzzards off her back!

204
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,006
Form up!

205
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,186
That's my head!

206
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,554
Get up! You can do it!

207
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:28,813
Morsov!

208
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:32,360
Morsov!
No!

209
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,319
Witness me!
Witness!

210
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:35,562
Witness!

211
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,077
Fly!

212
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:47,374
Witness!

213
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,616
Witness!

214
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,996
Mediocre, Morsov!

215
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,465
Mediocre!

216
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,154
Get ready!

217
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:28,866
Back me in!

218
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,254
They're coming!

219
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,974
We can't breathe down there!

220
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,224
Stay out of sight!

221
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:56,811
Now!

222
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,491
Go back!

223
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:12,417
Where's he going?

224
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,252
Hydraulics!

225
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:14,494
Hydraulics!

226
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:37,810
Yeah.

227
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,159
Now we bring home the booty.

228
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,683
She thinks she can lose us, Dad.

229
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,772
She thinks we're stupid.

230
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,393
She thinks she can lose us in there!

231
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:38,161
Fang it!

232
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,043
Fang it!

233
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:47,129
Why can't you stop?

234
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,136
Crew! Out of the way!

235
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,099
Out of the way!

236
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,558
What have you done?

237
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:53,927
What have you done?

238
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:58,806
Yeah.

239
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,235
We need counterweight.
Get the Blood Bag down the back.

240
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:31,515
Hunt them down!
Hunt them down!

241
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,449
Hey, head!

242
00:26:58,575 --> 00:26:59,747
Say bye-bye to the neck!

243
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,203
We're going in!

244
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,360
Come on! We've almost got her!

245
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,492
Come on! Hold it steady!

246
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:46,312
Oh, what a day!

247
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,310
What a lovely day!

248
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:08,955
I am the man...

249
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,132
who grabs the sun...

250
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:15,679
riding to Valhalla!

251
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:19,140
Witness me...

252
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:20,383
Blood Bag!

253
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,851
Witness!

254
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:52,003
I live, I die, I live again!

255
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,477
We're not going back.

256
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:06,335
Water.

257
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,183
You.

258
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,710
Angharad, is that just the wind...

259
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,121
or is that a furious vexation?

260
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,053
I got it!

261
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:38,432
Glory me, Blood Bag!
We snagged her alive.

262
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,017
He's gonna shred her. Shred her.

263
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,602
Bolt cutters.

264
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,270
Chain.

265
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,098
Hey, hey!

266
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,403
Oh, look at them.

267
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:55,232
So shiny. So chrome.

268
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,942
He's gonna be so grateful.

269
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,406
We could ask for anything.

270
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,239
I wanna drive the War Rig.

271
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,458
What are you gonna ask for?
That's my jacket.

272
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,418
Sure.

273
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:11,251
You can ask for more than a jacket.
We're going to the Green Place.

274
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:12,616
Wait, it's you and me.

275
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,315
We're going to the Green Place
of Many Mothers.

276
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,460
How does it feel?

277
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,875
It hurts.
Out here, everything hurts.

278
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,505
You wanna get through this?

279
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:01,214
Do as I say.

280
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,471
Now pick up what you can and run.

281
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,477
Kill switches.

282
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,651
I set the sequence myself.

283
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,817
This Rig goes nowhere without me.

284
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,946
You can get in.

285
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,741
Not without them.

286
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,334
So we wait.

287
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,682
You're relying on the gratitude
of a very bad man.

288
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,895
You've damaged one of his wives.
How grateful do you think he's gonna be?

289
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:40,192
You're sitting on 2000 horsepower
of nitro-boosted war machine.

290
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,525
I'd say you got
about a five-minute head start.

291
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:53,334
You want that thing off your face?

292
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,219
Let's go.

293
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:55,268
Of all the legs you had to shoot,
that one was attached to his favorite.

294
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,951
Smeg!

295
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,977
You don't have to do it
just because he tells you.

296
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,521
What choice does she have?
He's not gonna hurt us. He needs us.

297
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:42,768
Why?
To bargain.

298
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:43,975
Oh, he'll hurt us.

299
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:45,947
Think he's coming to the Green Place?

300
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,236
Never! He's a crazy smeg...

301
00:42:48,242 --> 00:42:49,109
who eats Schlesinger!

302
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:16,935
Nah, stay out of there.

303
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:18,270
Behind you.

304
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:24,569
The Gas Town Boys.

305
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:28,197
Don't damage the goods.

306
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,117
What do you see?

307
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,871
Big Rigs...

308
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,954
Polecats...

309
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:44,755
Flamers...

310
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:49,176
and there's the People Eater himself.

311
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,296
Coming to count the cost.

312
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:10,569
We're dragging something out back.

313
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:12,158
I think it's the fuel pod.

314
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,025
No, no.

315
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:16,403
I'll go.

316
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:41,881
Filth! You traitored him!

317
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:47,941
No unnecessary killing!

318
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,960
This War Boy wants me dead!
We agreed!

319
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:52,500
He's kamakrazee!

320
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,961
He's just a kid
at the end of his half-life!

321
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:57,259
No! I live. I die. I live again!

322
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,565
Hold him!
Tie him up!

323
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:00,799
Throw him out!

324
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,259
Chuck him out!

325
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:05,059
You got more friends.

326
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:08,812
Bullet Farmer.

327
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:11,231
They're coming from the Bullet Farm.
Yeah?

328
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:14,151
It's over. You can't defy him.

329
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:15,522
Just watch us, mate!

330
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:16,648
He is the one...

331
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:18,819
who grabbed the sun.
Look how slick he's fooled you.

332
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:20,828
He's a lying old man.
By his hand...

333
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,704
we'll be lifted up!
That's why we have...

334
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:24,494
his logo seared on our backs!

335
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,367
"Breeding Stock!" "Battle Fodder!"

336
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,617
No, I am awaited!

337
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,083
You're an old man's "Battle Fodder"!
Killing everyone...

338
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,169
and everything.
We're not to blame!

339
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,799
Then who killed the world?

340
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,912
I made a deal up ahead. Safe passage.

341
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,491
I don't know if it's still any good.

342
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:08,372
Get back in the hold!

343
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,164
Keep the hatch open.

344
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:18,423
I need you here.

345
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,298
You may have to drive the Rig.

346
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:28,803
You.

347
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:30,936
You stay.

348
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:33,233
You stay there.

349
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:39,190
Whatever you do, you can't be seen.

350
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,238
I'm supposed to be alone.

351
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:42,986
That was the deal.

352
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:50,789
Down here.

353
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,680
Hey.

354
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:14,813
What's your name?

355
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:17,686
What do I call you?

356
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,272
Does it matter?

357
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:23,738
Fine.

358
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:25,368
When I yell "fool"...

359
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,909
you drive out of here
as fast as you can.

360
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,037
This is the sequence:

361
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,494
One. One, two.

362
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:34,791
One.

363
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,877
Red. Black. Go.

364
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:39,799
You have it?

365
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:06,758
It's all here!

366
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,975
Three thousand gallons of guzzoline,
just like you asked!

367
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,730
I'm gonna unhitch the pod.

368
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,226
You drop the rocks.

369
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,156
You said:

370
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:31,870
"A few vehicles in pursuit.

371
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:33,580
Maybe."

372
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:35,032
We count three War Parties!

373
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,790
Yeah, well, I got unlucky.

374
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,747
Let's do this!

375
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:08,407
Fool!

376
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,783
That's our fuel!

377
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,507
Make way for the Ripsaw!

378
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:12,967
Come on! Move them!

379
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:23,807
Once I'm over...

380
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:26,277
clear the rocks
and bring everyone through.

381
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:27,518
Immortan!

382
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,772
Immortan Joe!

383
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:33,276
I got a War Boy!
Says he was on the War Rig.

384
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,571
You! Climb aboard!

385
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:41,075
Hey. Hey!

386
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:43,293
I got his boot!

387
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,537
I got the Blood Bag's boot!

388
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:47,460
Take me!

389
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,299
I got his boot!

390
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,921
All this for a family squabble.

391
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:56,595
Healthy babies.

392
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:05,885
Reload the clip.

393
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:07,512
I can't.

394
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:15,436
Gun!

395
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:17,610
Gimme the gun!

396
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:18,448
Not loaded yet!

397
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:19,316
Now!

398
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:20,566
We had a deal!

399
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:10,625
Rictus!

400
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:12,123
The wives!

401
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,712
No more flames.

402
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,720
Splendid!

403
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,338
Splendid!

404
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:24,589
That's my child!

405
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,174
My property!

406
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:30,177
Immorta--

407
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:43,610
Immortan. If I get on the Rig,
there's a way inside.

408
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:45,827
What is your name?
It's Nux.

409
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:48,492
I'll pike her in the spine.
Keep her breathing.

410
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:49,739
No.

411
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,575
Put a bullet in her skull.

412
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:54,544
Stop the Rig,
return my treasures to me...

413
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:57,210
and I, myself, will carry you...

414
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:58,923
to the Gates...

415
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:00,418
of Valhalla.

416
00:57:01,043 --> 00:57:02,169
Am I awaited?

417
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:04,467
You will ride eternal...

418
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:07,016
shiny and chrome.

419
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:09,722
Rictus!

420
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:12,062
Help him aboard!

421
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:15,222
Ready?

422
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:16,691
Here we go!

423
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:29,570
Mediocre!

424
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:01,103
Schlanger!

425
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,542
Look out!

426
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:26,836
Angharad!

427
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:28,546
Get out!

428
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:51,027
No!

429
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,361
Angharad!

430
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:09,088
Stop! Turn the Rig around!

431
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:11,515
Go back for her!

432
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:13,841
No.

433
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:15,511
Tell him to turn the Rig around!

434
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:16,808
Did you see it?

435
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:19,268
She went under the wheels.

436
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,891
Did you see it?

437
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,277
She went under the wheels.

438
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:26,651
We keep moving.

439
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:28,097
No!
We keep moving!

440
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,818
He doesn't know what he's talking about!

441
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:33,070
Whatever happens,
we're going to the Green Place.

442
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,698
The stupid Green Place.
We don't even know where to find it!

443
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:50,804
You all right?
On! On!

444
01:00:28,834 --> 01:00:30,051
Cheedo!

445
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:31,966
Cheedo, don't be stupid.

446
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:32,963
Stop!

447
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:34,760
He'll forgive us.
I know he will.

448
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:36,178
There is no going back!

449
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:38,264
We were his treasures!
Cheedo!

450
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:41,229
We were protected!
He gave us the high life!

451
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,224
What's wrong with that?
We are not things.

452
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:45,225
No!

453
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:47,683
We are not things!

454
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:49,185
We are not things.

455
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:52,320
I don't want to hear that again!
They were her words!

456
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:53,738
And now she's dead!

457
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:56,278
Wring your hands and tear your hair...

458
01:00:56,528 --> 01:00:57,996
but you're not going back.

459
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:00,244
You're not going back to him.

460
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,490
Angharad!

461
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,535
Come on! Come on!

462
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:21,768
So...

463
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:25,144
where is this...

464
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,227
Green Place?

465
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:31,484
It's a long night's run, heading east.

466
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:35,116
We need inventory.

467
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:36,735
Match every gun with its bullets.

468
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:43,412
I'm gonna go and do some repairs.

469
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,080
We need someone down the back.

470
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:46,078
I'll go.

471
01:01:46,328 --> 01:01:47,045
No.

472
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:49,039
I want you to stay together.

473
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:50,875
I can do it.

474
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,207
What are you doing here?

475
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:27,877
He saw it.

476
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:29,875
He saw it all.

477
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:33,792
My own Blood Bag driving the Rig
that killed her.

478
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:42,766
Stop doing that.

479
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:47,438
Stop.

480
01:02:57,565 --> 01:03:00,364
Three times the gates were open to me.

481
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:01,653
What gates?

482
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:04,160
I was awaited in Valhalla.

483
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:05,991
They were calling my name.

484
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:10,538
I should be walking with the Immorta.
McFeasting with the heroes of all time.

485
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:16,964
I'd say it was your manifest destiny not to.

486
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,469
I thought I was being spared
for something great.

487
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:25,185
I got to drive a pursuit vehicle.

488
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:29,140
For a while even Larry and Barry
stopped chewing on my windpipe.

489
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:31,187
Who are Larry and Barry?

490
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,310
My mates.

491
01:03:33,852 --> 01:03:35,149
Larry and Barry.

492
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:39,782
If they don't get me,
then the Night Fevers will.

493
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:08,099
Well, we've only got four for Big Boy here,
so he's all but useless.

494
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:10,646
But...

495
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:14,894
we can squirt off this little pinky
a raunchy 29 times.

496
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:19,440
Angharad used to call them Antiseed.

497
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,613
Plant one and watch something die.

498
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:40,437
Hold on, mate.

499
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:01,000
We are down 30,000 units of guzzoline...

500
01:06:01,249 --> 01:06:04,128
19 canisters of nitro,
12 assault bikes...

501
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:06,251
seven pursuit vehicles.

502
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,006
The deficit mounts.

503
01:06:08,256 --> 01:06:09,348
And now, sir...

504
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:12,556
you have us stuck in a quagmire.

505
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:14,266
Hey, Joe!

506
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,272
Boss!

507
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:20,527
Your girly's breathing her last!

508
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:23,067
What about the child?

509
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,782
Are you coming, brother?

510
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:35,124
Wait!

511
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:37,960
It's gone awful quiet in there.

512
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:39,375
Get it out.

513
01:06:39,621 --> 01:06:40,873
Get it out!

514
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,836
Come on! I've been called to the torture!

515
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:47,587
Patience!

516
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:51,883
Oh, you stay here with your grief, Daddy.

517
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:55,307
I'll fetch them for you.
Be careful! Protect the assets!

518
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:00,184
Just one angry shot...

519
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:02,481
for Furiosa.

520
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:03,727
Hut!

521
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:04,937
Yeah!

522
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:12,663
Crying shame.

523
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:15,031
Come.

524
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:17,157
Another month...

525
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:19,835
could have been your viable human!

526
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:21,421
Was it a male?

527
01:07:21,663 --> 01:07:23,256
Your A-1 Alpha prime.

528
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:27,756
Hey, Rictus!

529
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:30,805
You lost a baby brother!

530
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:35,010
Perfect in every way.

531
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:39,351
I had a baby brother!

532
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:41,732
I had a little baby brother!

533
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:43,773
And he was perfect!

534
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:45,895
Perfect in every way!

535
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:17,760
Come on.

536
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,855
Wouldn't wanna shoot the wives, sir.

537
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,197
Just probing.

538
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,127
He wants to help!

539
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:44,369
Who?

540
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:45,755
The War Boy!

541
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:47,419
Where did he come from?

542
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:49,065
I thought we threw him off the Rig!

543
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:54,505
There's high ground...

544
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:56,676
just beyond that thing.
He means the tree.

545
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,559
Yeah. Tree!

546
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:00,804
Leave him to me.

547
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:04,558
Say, anyone notice that bright light?
Encroaching gunfire?

548
01:09:05,183 --> 01:09:05,934
Get out.

549
01:09:06,184 --> 01:09:07,310
I can do this.
I know this machine.

550
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,153
He does. He's a Revhead.

551
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:15,735
You've got two left!

552
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:23,242
On him.

553
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:42,478
Don't breathe.

554
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:47,024
Hey!

555
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:48,609
Hey! Hey!

556
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:49,852
War Boy!

557
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:52,697
I'm gonna use the winch
around the tree thing!

558
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:54,774
Take this.

559
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,742
Let's get the engine plates.

560
01:09:57,985 --> 01:09:58,985
You drive the Rig!

561
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,038
Hold up a flare!
I am holding a flare!

562
01:10:01,823 --> 01:10:04,201
Closer!
It's right in front of your eyes!

563
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:18,264
Hut! Hut!

564
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:25,854
Blood Bag!

565
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,689
I am the scales of justice!

566
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:37,525
Conductor of the choir of death!

567
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:40,407
Sing, Brother Heckler.

568
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:43,664
Sing, Brother Koch!

569
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:50,167
Sing, brothers, sing! Sing!

570
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:52,849
Don't they know they're shooting at us?

571
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:08,560
Gun fever!

572
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:21,133
I never thought I'd do something
as shine as that.

573
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:23,139
How are the engines?

574
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:25,220
Very hot and real thirsty.

575
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:34,101
Hey. You need to take the War Rig
half a klick down the track.

576
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:38,192
What if you're not back
by the time the engines have cooled?

577
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:41,949
Well, you keep moving.

578
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,415
What do you suppose he's gonna do?

579
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:56,042
Retaliate first.

580
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:00,634
Let's go!

581
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:21,608
Are you hurt?

582
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:24,467
You're bleeding.

583
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:26,671
That's not his blood.

584
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:29,841
What is this?

585
01:14:30,758 --> 01:14:31,930
It's Mother's Milk.

586
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:15,469
It's okay.

587
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:16,767
Sleep.

588
01:15:17,972 --> 01:15:19,474
Get some rest.

589
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:32,536
How do you know this place even exists?

590
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:36,699
I was born there.

591
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:40,085
So why'd you leave?

592
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:41,666
I didn't.

593
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:45,170
I was taken as a child.

594
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:48,043
Stolen.

595
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:55,809
You done this before?

596
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:57,846
Many times.

597
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:01,144
Now that I drive a War Rig...

598
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:04,898
this is the best shot I'll ever have.

599
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:07,150
And them?

600
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:10,692
They're looking for hope.

601
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:13,111
What about you?

602
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:19,871
Redemption.

603
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:05,750
Hey, what's that?

604
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:20,470
I remember something like that.

605
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:34,278
Help me!

606
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:38,954
Help me!

607
01:17:42,449 --> 01:17:43,746
Help me, please!

608
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:45,245
Please!

609
01:17:45,953 --> 01:17:47,079
That's bait.

610
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:49,916
Stay in the Rig.

611
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:58,050
Hurry! Please, hurry! They'll be back!

612
01:17:59,466 --> 01:18:00,466
I am one of...

613
01:18:00,551 --> 01:18:01,803
the Vuvalini!

614
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:04,559
Of the Many Mothers!

615
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:09,360
My Initiate Mother was K.T. Concannon!

616
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:13,193
I am the daughter of Mary Jabassa.

617
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:17,242
My clan was Swaddle Dog!

618
01:19:04,448 --> 01:19:05,745
It's me.

619
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:15,543
There's something in the eyes.

620
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:18,179
Perhaps it is Jabassa's child.

621
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:24,259
This is our Furiosa.

622
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:29,098
How long has it been?

623
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:32,101
Seven thousand days.

624
01:19:32,726 --> 01:19:34,820
Plus the ones I don't remember.

625
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:37,277
Furiosa.

626
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:40,364
What happened to your mother?

627
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:43,162
She died.

628
01:19:43,988 --> 01:19:45,661
On the third day.

629
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:53,922
From where did you come?

630
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:58,011
The West. Citadel. Beyond the mountains.

631
01:20:02,298 --> 01:20:02,924
The men.

632
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:04,345
Who are they?

633
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:05,934
They're reliable.

634
01:20:06,343 --> 01:20:08,016
They helped us get here.

635
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:22,117
Where did you find such creatures?

636
01:20:24,695 --> 01:20:25,992
So soft.

637
01:20:26,697 --> 01:20:28,119
This one has all her teeth!

638
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:39,335
I can't wait for them to see it.

639
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,086
See?

640
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:43,506
See what?

641
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:45,008
Home.

642
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:50,513
The Green Place.

643
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:52,891
But if you came from the West...

644
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:55,479
you passed it.

645
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:58,278
The crows.

646
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:01,065
The creepy place with all the crows.

647
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:03,492
The soil.
We had to get out.

648
01:21:03,734 --> 01:21:05,532
We had no water.
The water was filth.

649
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:07,405
It was poisoned. It was sour.

650
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:09,031
And then the crows came.

651
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:11,033
We couldn't grow anything.

652
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:12,626
Where are the others?

653
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:13,868
What others?

654
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:15,250
The Many Mothers.

655
01:21:15,496 --> 01:21:16,998
We're the only ones left.

656
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:19,059
Look.

657
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:24,023
That's what you call a satellite.

658
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,026
Miss Giddy told us about those.

659
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:30,453
They used to bounce messages
across the Earth.

660
01:22:31,238 --> 01:22:32,785
Shows.

661
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:35,329
Everyone in the old world had a show.

662
01:22:37,661 --> 01:22:38,503
Do you think there's still...

663
01:22:38,745 --> 01:22:40,042
somebody out there?

664
01:22:41,248 --> 01:22:42,795
Sending shows?

665
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:44,426
Who knows?

666
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:47,797
Those are the Plains of Silence.

667
01:22:50,424 --> 01:22:52,472
Stay right where you are, little Joe.

668
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:54,846
Kind of lost its novelty out here.

669
01:22:55,095 --> 01:22:56,688
You having a baby?

670
01:22:57,764 --> 01:22:59,232
Warlord Junior.

671
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:00,727
Gonna be so ugly.

672
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:02,773
It could be a girl.

673
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:06,239
You kill people with that, do you?

674
01:23:06,523 --> 01:23:08,571
Killed everyone I ever met out here.

675
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:11,161
Headshots. All of them.
Snap. Right in the medulla.

676
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:13,371
Thought somehow you girls
were above that.

677
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:19,165
Come here.

678
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:27,878
Take a peek.

679
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:30,131
Seeds.

680
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:32,599
These are from home.

681
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:35,014
Heirlooms. The real thing.

682
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:37,520
I plant one every chance I get.

683
01:23:37,763 --> 01:23:38,764
Where?

684
01:23:39,139 --> 01:23:42,063
So far, nothing's took.
Earth's too sour.

685
01:23:42,592 --> 01:23:44,144
So many different kinds.

686
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:46,484
Trees, flowers, fruit.

687
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:49,567
Back then, everyone had their fill.

688
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:52,494
Back then,
there was no need to snap anybody.

689
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:09,126
Can I talk to you?

690
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:31,112
I've talked with the others.

691
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:41,160
We're never gonna have a better chance
to make it across the salt.

692
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:47,333
If we leave the Rig here, and load
the motorcycles up with as much as we can...

693
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:50,086
we can maybe ride for 160 days.

694
01:24:52,796 --> 01:24:54,764
One of those bikes is yours.

695
01:24:55,882 --> 01:24:57,134
Fully loaded.

696
01:25:00,262 --> 01:25:02,435
You're more than welcome
to come with us.

697
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:08,403
I'll make my own way.

698
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:17,162
You know, hope is a mistake.

699
01:25:24,036 --> 01:25:27,336
If you can't fix what's broken,
you'll, uh....

700
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:30,884
You'll go insane.

701
01:25:47,059 --> 01:25:48,686
Where are you, Max?

702
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:52,026
Where are you?

703
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:55,697
Help us. You promised to help us.

704
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:08,372
Come on, Pa! Let's go.

705
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,412
All right.

706
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:44,912
This is your way home.

707
01:26:48,412 --> 01:26:49,459
We go back?

708
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:53,505
Back?
Yeah.

709
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:55,468
I thought you weren't insane anymore.

710
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:56,928
What are they saying?

711
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:59,389
He wants to go back from where they came.

712
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:00,803
The Citadel.

713
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:03,223
What's there to find at the Citadel?

714
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:05,186
Green.

715
01:27:05,429 --> 01:27:06,772
And water.

716
01:27:08,014 --> 01:27:11,894
There's a ridiculous amount of clear water.
And a lot of crops.

717
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:14,584
Got everything you need.
Long as you're not afraid of heights.

718
01:27:14,813 --> 01:27:16,053
Where does the water come from?

719
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:19,864
He pumps it up from deep in the earth.
Calls it Aqua Cola and claims it for himself.

720
01:27:20,110 --> 01:27:22,363
And because he owns it,
he owns all of us.

721
01:27:22,612 --> 01:27:23,784
I don't like him already.

722
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:26,408
It'll take two weeks
to skirt the Wall of Mountains.

723
01:27:26,658 --> 01:27:27,658
No.

724
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:30,545
I suggest we go back
the same way we came.

725
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,673
Through the canyon.

726
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:38,588
It's open. We know that. Right?
He brought all his war parties through.

727
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:42,466
So we take the War Rig and we charge it
right through the middle of them.

728
01:27:42,716 --> 01:27:43,876
We can decouple the tanker...

729
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:45,219
at the pass.

730
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:47,096
Shut it off behind us.

731
01:27:51,308 --> 01:27:53,857
And how exactly do we take the Citadel?

732
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:56,192
Assuming we're still alive by then.

733
01:27:56,438 --> 01:27:59,032
If we can block the pass,
it'll be easy.

734
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:03,029
All that's left are his War Pups
and War Boys too sick to fight.

735
01:28:03,737 --> 01:28:05,489
And we'll be with Nux.

736
01:28:06,156 --> 01:28:07,373
He's a War Boy.

737
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:10,496
He'll be bringing us home.
Bringing back what's stolen, as he's meant to.

738
01:28:13,663 --> 01:28:14,835
Yeah.

739
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:17,384
It feels like hope.

740
01:28:18,585 --> 01:28:20,132
I like this plan.

741
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:21,713
We can start again.

742
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:24,053
Just like the old days!

743
01:28:25,634 --> 01:28:26,851
Look.

744
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:29,270
It'll be a hard day.

745
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:32,816
But I guarantee you
that a 160 days' ride that way...

746
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:37,191
there's nothing but salt.

747
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:42,527
At least that way, you know,
we might be able to...

748
01:28:44,027 --> 01:28:45,279
together...

749
01:28:46,863 --> 01:28:48,957
come across some kind of redemption.

750
01:29:19,729 --> 01:29:21,106
War Rig!

751
01:29:21,398 --> 01:29:23,321
That's the War Rig!

752
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:34,543
That's them.

753
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:36,038
Why are they going back?

754
01:29:36,496 --> 01:29:38,169
Do they wish to surrender?

755
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:40,376
They are heading for the canyon.

756
01:29:42,252 --> 01:29:45,222
They're going back to the Citadel!

757
01:29:45,463 --> 01:29:47,136
They know it's undefended!

758
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:48,474
Bollocks!

759
01:29:49,843 --> 01:29:50,969
Roll up!

760
01:30:01,271 --> 01:30:02,523
Go!

761
01:30:24,878 --> 01:30:26,380
What are you doing?
Praying.

762
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:27,630
To who?

763
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:29,307
Anyone that's listening.

764
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:54,698
Here we go, girls!

765
01:30:57,327 --> 01:30:58,579
That's mine!

766
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:04,926
He'll try to get in front of us.
Spike our wheels.

767
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:13,264
Don't blow my engine.

768
01:31:13,802 --> 01:31:14,803
Gonna nudge him.

769
01:31:15,053 --> 01:31:16,145
Just a little.

770
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:32,079
You filth! You traitored him!

771
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:37,950
Yeah!

772
01:31:56,094 --> 01:31:56,811
Go.

773
01:32:23,288 --> 01:32:24,288
Gotta back off.

774
01:32:24,998 --> 01:32:27,421
Engine one is gone.
Two's about to blow.

775
01:32:27,667 --> 01:32:28,667
Right.

776
01:32:29,169 --> 01:32:30,169
Are you a Black Thumb?

777
01:32:31,629 --> 01:32:32,881
All right. Engine one. Now.

778
01:32:33,131 --> 01:32:34,474
You and me. Fifth wheel.

779
01:32:34,883 --> 01:32:36,009
We'll unhook the tanker.

780
01:32:48,646 --> 01:32:49,646
One man, one bullet.

781
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:09,167
I cannot see.
Maadi! Maadi!

782
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:10,589
I can't see.

783
01:33:49,999 --> 01:33:50,999
Hey!

784
01:33:51,209 --> 01:33:52,711
Harpoons and plows!

785
01:33:53,128 --> 01:33:54,345
They're hauling us back!

786
01:34:05,598 --> 01:34:07,817
Leave three bolts. Three.

787
01:35:26,346 --> 01:35:27,346
Hey, you!

788
01:35:42,987 --> 01:35:44,284
Are you okay?

789
01:35:46,991 --> 01:35:48,618
I think she's hurt.

790
01:36:12,475 --> 01:36:13,475
Hey!

791
01:36:39,627 --> 01:36:40,219
No!

792
01:36:44,590 --> 01:36:45,590
No!

793
01:36:50,388 --> 01:36:51,731
Hey.

794
01:36:52,265 --> 01:36:53,265
Stay with me.

795
01:36:53,516 --> 01:36:55,268
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

796
01:36:55,518 --> 01:36:56,895
Hey.
Hey! Are you there?

797
01:36:58,771 --> 01:37:00,251
You finish that! I'll finish her!

798
01:38:30,613 --> 01:38:31,613
Valhalla!

799
01:39:12,321 --> 01:39:13,321
Engine one's good.

800
01:39:14,282 --> 01:39:15,454
For now.

801
01:40:03,664 --> 01:40:05,086
She's hurt! She's hurt...

802
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:06,380
real bad!

803
01:41:36,757 --> 01:41:37,757
You hear that?

804
01:41:38,426 --> 01:41:40,019
We're gonna see two airborne V8s.

805
01:41:41,554 --> 01:41:43,272
I'm gonna need you to drive.

806
01:41:45,474 --> 01:41:47,147
I'll get him out of our way.

807
01:42:54,168 --> 01:42:55,465
Rictus!

808
01:42:56,545 --> 01:42:57,545
Take me!

809
01:43:10,976 --> 01:43:11,727
Cheedo!

810
01:43:11,977 --> 01:43:13,524
What are you doing?
Good girl.

811
01:43:17,858 --> 01:43:18,984
Come here.

812
01:43:24,407 --> 01:43:25,407
Big Boy!

813
01:43:31,539 --> 01:43:33,382
Here! Here!

814
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:28,433
Remember me?

815
01:44:49,784 --> 01:44:50,831
He's dead!

816
01:44:51,660 --> 01:44:52,832
He's dead.

817
01:45:11,847 --> 01:45:14,817
When you're across safe,
I'll jam the throttle and follow you.

818
01:45:15,601 --> 01:45:16,648
Come on!

819
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:20,277
Hurry! We're nearly at the pass.

820
01:46:07,903 --> 01:46:09,496
Witness me.

821
01:46:15,953 --> 01:46:16,954
Rictus!

822
01:47:12,551 --> 01:47:14,178
Why is she making that noise?

823
01:47:14,428 --> 01:47:16,146
She's pumping air into her chest cavity.

824
01:47:17,014 --> 01:47:18,561
She's collapsing her lungs...

825
01:47:18,807 --> 01:47:20,605
one breath at a time.

826
01:47:26,357 --> 01:47:27,529
I know.

827
01:47:30,486 --> 01:47:31,954
I am so sorry.

828
01:47:34,698 --> 01:47:35,950
I know. I know.

829
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:38,544
Hold it there.

830
01:47:39,411 --> 01:47:40,503
All right.

831
01:47:41,038 --> 01:47:43,882
Put that on there. Press it in. Hey.

832
01:47:45,250 --> 01:47:45,921
Hey.

833
01:47:46,168 --> 01:47:47,294
Home.

834
01:47:54,593 --> 01:47:55,936
Home.

835
01:48:02,351 --> 01:48:04,399
No, no, no. No, no, no.
She's exsanguinated.

836
01:48:04,645 --> 01:48:05,965
Drained all her blood.
Well....

837
01:48:07,523 --> 01:48:08,615
Hold these.

838
01:48:09,441 --> 01:48:10,441
We need that.

839
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:12,532
Needle.

840
01:48:13,529 --> 01:48:14,529
Come on.

841
01:48:15,823 --> 01:48:16,823
Take this.

842
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:20,660
Keep her awake.

843
01:48:21,370 --> 01:48:22,622
Furiosa.

844
01:48:26,291 --> 01:48:28,464
Okay, that's not retracting.

845
01:48:29,128 --> 01:48:30,345
There we go.

846
01:48:31,213 --> 01:48:33,136
All right, hold it up. Hold it up.

847
01:48:34,717 --> 01:48:35,889
All right.

848
01:48:36,260 --> 01:48:37,260
Sorry.

849
01:48:39,346 --> 01:48:41,815
There you go. Okay. There you go.

850
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:55,536
Max.

851
01:48:56,864 --> 01:48:58,366
My name is Max.

852
01:48:59,867 --> 01:49:00,916
Yeah.

853
01:49:07,124 --> 01:49:08,717
That's my name.

854
01:49:50,584 --> 01:49:51,584
Brake!

855
01:49:57,132 --> 01:49:58,258
