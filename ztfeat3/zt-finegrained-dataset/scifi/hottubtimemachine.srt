00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,920
He's got
that runt ball.

161
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Huh.

162
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,550
He said one of his balls
was shriveled up. . .

163
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,800
Oh, yeah.

164
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,430
. . .like a spoiled grape.

165
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,890
Wasn't it that
quarterback on the Bears

166
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,060
who had his ball crushed
on the field. Right?

167
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,640
Yeah.
Yeah.

168
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,480
Right, right.
'82? Yeah, yeah.

169
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,730
He came back
from that, though.

170
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,850
Strong as ever.

171
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,940
Fuck yeah.

172
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,190
But I don't know about Lou.

173
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,820
It’s just like. . .
No.

174
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,820
(SIGHS) It’s just like
an accumulation
of punishment.

175
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,900
Fuck you guys.

176
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:13,990
Oh!
Hey!

177
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,990
There he is. Hey.

178
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,580
I can fucking hear everything
you're saying, all right?

179
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,080
Look who's awake.
What's up, man?

180
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,620
Hey.
Hey, man.

181
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
What's up?

182
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,840
You look just
like my friend Nick.

183
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,000
And you look
like my friend Adam.

184
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,340
But you wouldn't be
those guys because

185
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,590
I’ve been calling
and calling them,

186
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,670
and they haven't
returned my calls.

187
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,430
So, listen, Violator.

188
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,680
Me and Nick
got a little surprise
for you.

189
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,520
Something special
that the three of us
can do.

190
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,890
Come on. You guys.

191
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,270
ADAM:
Are you curious?
No!

192
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,690
I didn't fucking try
and kill myself.

193
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,480
lf I wanted to kill myself,
I’d fucking kill myself.

194
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,730
I’d be awesome at it.

195
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,530
A shotgun to the dick.

196
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,360
I’m glad you didn't do it.

197
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,860
It’s good to see
you guys, anyway.

198
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:02,040
So, just out of curiosity,
what's the surprise?

199
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,660
Tell him.

200
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,710
Ko-di-ak. . .

202

No fucking way!

203
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,630
NICK: Yes, sir.
ADAM: Yeah.

204
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,670
Fucking K-Vals?
Holy shit!

205
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,130
Yes, sir. Bang!

206
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,050
We fucking ski, right?
We fucking rage.

207
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,340
Chimney Point
at the end of the night

208
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,930
with a bottle of scotch
to wash it all down. Oh!

209
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,810
And you guys are paying
for the whole thing?

210
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,480
Sure.
Yep.

211
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,560
Let's go tonight.

212
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,650
We go tomorrow.

213
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:29,730
Let's go now.
Let's go now.

214
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,020
I just got to
get rid of this thing.
It’s really uncomfortable.

215
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,280
You should wait
for the nurse
or something.

216
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,780
(GRUNTING)
I got it. I got it.

217
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,860
Hold on, Lou.
No, no, no, no.

218
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,360
Let somebody
do that for you.

Oh, shit.
God.

222
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,500
Did I get that on you?

223
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,790
Yes, you did.
Damn it!

224
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,500
It’s only pee.
Relax, it's only pee.

225
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,430
There's Lou.

226
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,800
JACOB: Good,
he's drinking already.

227
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,350
Look at this shit.

228
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,680
Do you remember when I was 12
and he tried to bite me?

229
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,350
Yeah, but he. . .
You had that coming.

230
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,020
Hey, Violator.
NICK: Lou.

231
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,020
What the fuck
is he doing here?

232
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,270
It’s nice to
see you, too, Lou.

233
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,030
(IN MOCKING TONE)
"Nice to see you, too, Lou."
Fuck you, Jacob.

00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,950
You suck and you know it.

235
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,280
You just ruined
my fucking weekend.

236
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,290
Hey, Lily will come back.
Trust me.

237
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,460
No, she won't.
LOU: No, she won't.

238
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,840
No, she won't.
No, she won't.

239
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,670
She basically
thinks I’m an asshole,
you know?

240
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,680
Like
a completely self-absorbed,
delusional. . .

241
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,430
She's got a point.
. . .narcissistic.

242
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,970
Fuck you.
LOU: You're better off.

243
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,220
Take my word for it.
Look at me.

244
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,560
Fuck wives, man.
Fuck kids.

245

Lock it down
or they will take
everything from you.

246
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,570
God damn it!
Who the fuck are
you texting with?

247
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,730
Just a friend of mine.

Male or fucking female?

249
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,610
For your information,
I’ve had
a lot of girlfriends.

250
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,700
Hot ones.

251
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,450

lots of boyfriends.

It’s like
the Russian Red Bull.

260
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,550
It’s got shit in it
that's not even legal here.

just go to Pinnacle?

It would have taken,
like, half the time.

You wanna go
to Kodiak Valley,
trust me.

I broke up with
Jenny Stedmeyer there.

276
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,430
What made you break
up with her, again?

277
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,970
I don't know.
We swapped virginities
junior year.

278
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,680
All we did was
listen to records
and have sex.

279
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,390
And she was epic,
I mean she was. . .
She was epic.

280
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,560
Yeah, man.
She was hot.

281
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,480
And then when l
broke up with her,
she was so mad,

282
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,810
she practically
stabbed me in the eye
with a fork.

283
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,940
Actually, she did stab me
in the eye with a fork.

284
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,190
She was a one-percenter, man.

Yeah.

One of us is gonna
start writing a novel,

and then we all
get snowed in,

Schwarzenegger back
to kill Sarah Connor

628
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,290
so that John Connor
could never be born.

629
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,210
But if John Connor
don't send Michael Biehn
back to protect her,

630
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,550
then they never fuck,
and John Connor ain't born
in the first place!

631
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,640
It checks out.
Yeah, that's pretty good.

632
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,310
Wait, wait,
check the fucking drawer.
See if the carving's there.

633
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,560
Check the fucking drawer.

634
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,890
ADAM: Fuck!

635
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,190
It’s gone.

636
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,320
(SIGHING)

637
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,440
This shit is real.

638
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,740
The carving you
made 20 years ago,

639
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,740
about me sucking
cocks and dicks,

640
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,910
it's not there.
Wait.

641
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,700
Is "cocks" still there?

642
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,240
Nothing.
I mean, it's not there.

643
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,410
What about "dicks"?

644
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,120
Neither "cocks,"
nor "dicks," nor "sucks."

645
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,750
Oh, God!

646
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,630
That's it.
We stuck in
the fucking '80s!

647
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:59,550
How am I supposed
to get a job?

648
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,720
I’m so scared.

649
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,380
(EXCLAIMS)

650
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,180
Looks like you
burned out your. . .

651
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,010
Heck, you fried
your timing crossover.

652
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,060
Would you mind
putting that down, sir,

653
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,270
that coal shovel,
before somebody gets hurt?

654
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,810
Did somebody call you?

655
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,360
Excuse me one minute.

656
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,440
(FARTS)

657
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,490
Who ever calls us?

658
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,570
(LAUGHING)

659
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,580
And who answers
when the call comes
from within? Huh?

660
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,500
I thought
maybe I could pull the part
from one of the other tubs.

661
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:39,050
But it turns out this is
a very special model
that you have here.

662
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:41,420
You've got to be
very careful, I tell you.

663
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:46,260
One little thing is changed,
the whole system
can go haywire.

664
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,300
Do you understand
what I’m saying?

665
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,520
The whole system
can go haywire

666
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,850
if you change
one little thing.

667
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:56,190
Wait a minute.
We need that to
get back in time?

668
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,310
Well, you're back here.

669
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,110
I mean,
I can tell you've all been
to Kodiak Valley before.

670
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,650
I haven't.
Maybe not her,

671
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,240
but I know that
you were here.

672
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,870
You know what's
going on here,
don't you, old man?

673
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,160
Yes, I do.

674
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,080
Your tub is on the fritz.
It'd behoove you to fix it.

675
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,200
(HOT TUB STARTING UP)

676
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,500
What?

677
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,170
It’s working.

678
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,550
NICK: Damn.
I think it's still broke.

679
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,710
Shit.

680
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,260
JACOB: Where'd he go?

681
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,140
That motherfucker's
in on it, man.

682
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,890
What was all that
cryptic shit he was saying

683
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,100
about not changing
one little thing?

684
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,600
I know exactly what he meant.
He was talking about
the butterfly effect.

685
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,100
That was
a great fucking movie.

686
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,640
One little change
has a ripple effect

687
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,100
and it affects
everything else.

688
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,110
Like, a butterfly
floats its wings

689
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:43,780
and Tokyo explodes,
or there's a tsunami in,
like, somewhere.

690
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,860
Dude, yes, exactly.
Or you step on a bug

691
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,910
and the fucking
Internet's never invented.

692
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,450
Then you have
to talk to girls
with your mouth.

693
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,950
Yeah. I was more
concerned about bigger
consequences,

694
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,290
like me not being born.

695
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,790
Oh, yeah.
No, I don't care
about that.

696
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,290
The point is,
what did we do
20 years ago?

697
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,630
Let's figure it
out right now.

698
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:02,500
We gotta do
the exact same thing.

699
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,300
I had that gig.
That's right.

700
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,550
You got up on stage
and you were wildly
mediocre.

701
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,970
And that led to
nothing of a career.

702
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,600
Okay, first of all,
fuck you, motherfucker!

703
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,810
I could have had a career,
but I got married
and I went a different way.

704
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,310
Which way is that?
The way that sucked?

705
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,770
Didn't you also
bang that groupie?

706
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,520
What was her name?
Tara.

707
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,320
You banged her.
You got to
go do that again.

708
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,740
I did do that.
But, fuck, no,
I’m married!

709
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,610
I can't go around
banging girls in hot tubs.

710
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,070
Nick, it's 1986.
You can't cheat on someone
you don't know yet.

711
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,410
You haven't
even met Courtney.

712
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,660
Lucifer,
itinerary please.

713
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,750
Uh. . . Nothing
really happened.

714
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,620
I actually
fucked a chick, too.
So I’ll just do that.

715
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,920
I seem to remember
you getting your ass whooped.

716
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,040
(LAUGHING)

717
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,670
ADAM: Oh, yeah.
NICK: That's right.

718
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,590
That ski patrol dude
pummeled you
like it was his job.

719
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:47,760
Yeah, no.
I don't remember it
that way.

720
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,880
I do.

721
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,470
Yeah. He fucked you up.
You cried and peed.

722
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,510
Fuck this, man!
This is fucking bullshit!

723
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,600
Would you just
think of somebody other
than yourself, man?

724
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,730
There's four of us.

725
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,730
It’s the fucking '80s, guys!

726
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:02,520
Let's do what we wanna do.
Free love!

727
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,270
JACOB: That's
the '60s, dipshit.

728
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,320
No, we had, like,
Reagan and AIDS.

729
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,280
Let's get the fuck
out of here, okay?

730
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,700
Do the right thing, Violator.

731
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,620
God damn it!
This is fucking bullshit!

732
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,700
Tonight's the night
you broke up
with Jenny Stedmeyer.

733
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,990
Shit.
LOU: Yeah, you got stabbed

734
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,040
in the fucking
eyeball tonight!

735
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,790
Hey, man,
do you want backup?

736
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,330
I can't,
the butterflies
won't let me.

737
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,830
JENNY: Yo, Adam?
You guys in there?
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

738
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,130
Oh, shit.

739
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:30,090
There you are. Hey!

740
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,680
How come you guys
didn't meet us at
the chair lift this morning?

741
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,890
You were going to
show me some moves.

742
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:36,430
Hi, baby.
I missed you.

743
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,520
I must have forgot.

744
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,650
Perv. That's from Mandy.

745
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,520
Hey, new guy.
What's up?
Hey.

746
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,980
So we're in 214.
I’m gonna go get ready.

747
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,360
Okay.
Meet me in
my room, okay?

748
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,860
Okay.
Okay.

749
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,070
Love the PJs, Nick.
You look hot.

750
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,990
Poison's tonight.

751
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,200
Wow!

752
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,080
I don't remember her
being that fucking beautiful.

753
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,750
And tight.
She's so tight.

754
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,920
She's really
fucking tight!

755
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,330
She's the great
white buffalo, man.

756
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,670
Great white buffalo.
Great white buffalo.

757
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,380
Don't start that.

758
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,920
Great white buffalo.
Great white buffalo.

759
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:10,970
Why did I ever
break up with her?

760
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,090
Why would l
break up with her?

761
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,180
JACOB: Doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter.

762
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,930
'Cause you have to
do it again. Right?

763
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,640
Right, right, right.

764
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,010
JACOB: All right. We're
all gonna meet back here.

765
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,180
Hopefully that hot tub's fixed
and we can get the fuck out
of here.

766
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,770
Okay, let's party
like it's 1986.

767
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:22,980
All right. On three?

768
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,060
One, two, three. . .
One, two, three. . .

769
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,900
Hot tub time machine!
Wait. . .

770
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,980
What are we. . .
What's the. . .

771
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,070
Who said,
"Hot tub time machine?"

772
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,320
We didn't tell you
about the new thing,
with our hands?

773
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,900
No.
On three, we always. . .

774
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,280
From now on,
we're gonna say,
"Hot tub time machine."

775
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,610
I told you, I think
that's fucking stupid.

776
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,700
You were in
the bathroom.

777
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,780
No, but this is a real
bonding event for us.

778
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:36,870
This doesn't happen
all the time.

779
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,330

it can be
interpreted
either way.

you know?

and there's two dudes
that she's waxing.

kind of slutty,
right?

Does she seem
that way to you?

837
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,900
It’s just, she never
told me who my dad is.

00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:44,970
How did it go
with Jenny?

1097
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:46,220
(JENNY WHOOPING)

1098
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,470
Oh, my God.

1099
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:52,890
Oh, my God. Whoo!
Why aren't you dancing?

1100
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,900
Whoa! What's your name?

1101
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,940
That's Jacob.
That's Jenny.

1102
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,110
What the fuck
are you doing?

1103
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:01,610
You're supposed to
break up with her!
I know.

1104
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:03,200
No, no, no.
Just check it out, okay?

1105
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,160
Maybe she's
the key to something.

1106
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,740
And I messed it up
when I broke up
with her before,

1107
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,120
and now the universe
is giving me
another crack at it.

1108
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,000
And if you thought
you could really start over

1109
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,580
and do something
totally different,

1110
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,250
you wouldn't
even consider it?

1111
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:17,670
You're absolutely right.

1112
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:18,710
You think so? Really?

1113
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,960
No. Fuck, no!

1114
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,300
Come on!

1115
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,090
What do you mean,
you didn't do it?

1116
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,640
I’m getting to it.

1117
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,800
No, we were supposed to do
everything that we did.

1118
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:29,890
That's what I remember.

1119
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:31,390
Yeah, Adam,
what the fuck, man?

1120
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:32,600
You were supposed
to fucking dump her.

1121
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,140
You think l
liked getting my ass fucked
up and down the entire street?

1122
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:36,650
Because I didn't.
It’s not that I’m
not gonna do it,

1123
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:38,480
I just haven't done it yet.
There's a big difference.

1124
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,730
Look at my face, dude.

1125
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,480
Look at my fucking face!
Drink me in.

1126
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:42,980
You think
I wouldn't have liked
to have changed this?

1127
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:46,400
Shut the fuck up, Lou.
You tried to rope me
into a three-way.

1128
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:47,530
What?
Did you?

1129
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:48,740
No.
Yes.

1130
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,160
Lou! Did you?

1131
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,410
I didn't fuck that girl.
Okay?

1132
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:56,620
Because I’m committed
to not changing the past.

1133
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:58,040
Right.
It had nothing
to do with her

1134
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,670
wanting to be
a Chinese finger trap.

1135
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:01,710
And I’m not saying that
because she was Asian.

1136
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,170
So you're telling me
I cheated on my wife
for no reason.

1137
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,260
(IMITATING BABY CRYING)

1138
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:06,380
ADAM: Just relax, okay?

1139
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:08,010
I’m gonna do it.
I just haven't done it yet!

1140
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:09,090
You're unbelievable.

1141
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,930
Hey, Nick,
can I ask you a question?
Yes.

1142
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:12,810
Does this seem like
it's all about Adam again?

1143
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:15,180
Yeah, just like
Cincinnati.

1144
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:17,520
What?
You gonna bring that up?

1145
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,900
We said we weren't gonna talk
about Cincinnati ever, okay?

1146
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,770
Is this why you have
that shoebox in your closet
that says "Cincinnati"?

1147
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:23,860
Yeah.

1148
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,030
What?
That's fucking admissible!

1149
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:26,700
You keep it
in the closet?

1150
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:29,160
What was
I supposed to do with it?
You can't bury those things.

1151
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,870
And you wrote
"Cincinnati" on it?

1152
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:33,870
How do I know which one
it's supposed to be?

1153
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,250
Is it a fetus?

1154
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:36,710
My friends
are ridiculous.

1155
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:38,120
Why are we still
talking about this?

1156
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:40,080
Okay, we said
we would never
talk about that.

1157
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:43,460
By the way, where does
it say in the fucking
friendship handbook

1158
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:47,090
that you are the only one
who is allowed
any fucking problems?

1159
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:49,260
I forgot that it says
in the asshole handbook

1160
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:52,100
that you can just
fuck over your friends
whenever you want!

1161
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:53,810
Actually, it would say that
in the asshole handbook

1162
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:55,310
if it was, like,
guidelines for being
an asshole,

1163
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:56,850
that's what it would say.
NICK: Why wouldn't
it say that

1164
00:46:56,930 --> 00:46:58,060
in the asshole handbook?
Yeah, it would say

1165
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,310
to fuck your friends.
"Fuck over your friends."

1166
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,690
No, no, no.
JACOB:
Have you ever read a book?

1167
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:04,020
You're right.
I’m sorry, my bad.
You guys are right.

1168
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:06,480
But if you're changing
the fucking past, okay,

1169
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:08,900
then I’m changing
the fucking past,
all right?

No! Lou!

1171

Okay! We're in the game!
I like this.

1172
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,870
I didn't change anything yet,
I just didn't do it.

1173

And if we're
changing shit,

1174

you better
be there at midnight
to get my fucking back.

Fuck!

1178

I’ll be back in a minute.
Where are you going?

1179
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:26,210
I gotta go.
I’m getting out of here.

1180

No, no, Adam,
listen to me, please.

1181

Jenny Stedmeyer is not
your fucking destiny, okay?

1182

She's just some girl.

in high school, okay?

1184
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:35,510
I know!
I just got some
emotions coming up.

1185
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,930
I got some feelings
that I got to deal with.

1186
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,020
I’m gonna do it.
I believe in you.
You're awesome.

1187
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,690
You know what? That's fine.
Everybody just take off!

the repairman myself
and fix the time machine.

that's not
what's going on here.

you're a super-terrific guy

amazing people that I’ve
ever met. I can't. . ."

1249
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,540
Are you breaking up with me?
That's what this. . .
This is a break-up note?

1250
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,170
I’m sorry, Adam.

1251
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:11,670
All these years!
You stabbed me in the eye
with a fucking fork

1252
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,510
and you were gonna
break up with me anyway?

1253
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:14,670
Is that what
you're saying to me?

1254
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,800
I did what?

1255
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,720
Why are you
breaking up with me?
That's not how this works.

1256
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:21,850
You're such a great guy
and you're gonna
find the right girl,

1257
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:23,140
but it's not me.

1258
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:26,890
And everybody
knows what a big deal
you're gonna be some day.

1259
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:31,270
No, I’m not.
I’m not.
I’m not anybody.

1260
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,110
Adam, okay.
It’s not you, it's me.

1261
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:39,570
I say that to you.
You don't say that to me.

1262
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,530
That's not how this works.

1263
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:44,620
Do you know
what happens to you
if we don't go back?

1264
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,290
You end up with
Billy Lavatino.

1265
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:47,370
I like him.

1266
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:50,380
You may like him,
but then you end up pregnant
with, like, trucker hips,

1267
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,170
and you have a baby
with Billy Lavatino,

and you're addicted
to Weight Watchers,
you little bitch.

00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,010
What did you
just call me?
Take this fucking back!

about bad stuff,
either, okay?

I’m just talking
about good stuff.

1281

Like keeping
Manimal on the air,
you know?

Or preventing
Miley Cyrus.

from what?

1284

Just leave me alone

these mushrooms, Adam?

00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,790
Hey, screw you, kid.
Hey, okay,

1395
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:38,200
and if you win,
name your price.

1396
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:41,750
Touchdown pass at
37 seconds, exactly?

1397
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:43,250
LOU: Exactly.

1398
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,250
Fine.

1399
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,920
You lose,
I take all your winnings.

1400
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,050
Done.

1401
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:49,510
And you give your
buddy a blowjob.

1402
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:51,510
What? Hell, no.

1403
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:52,760
Wow!

1404
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:53,930
Deal.
Deal?

1405
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:55,720
Well done.
I like your style.
I like your style.

1406
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:56,890
He's very creative.

1407
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:59,390
I don't like you
taking liberties
with my dick.

1408
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,020
Relax, okay?

1409
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:03,600
We know the fucking future.
We can't lose.

1410
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:10,610
Hey. Hey, there.
What are you doing?

1411
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,820
Hi.
Hey.

1412
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:15,240
Okay, how's the view
from down there?

1413
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,120
(SIGHS)

1414
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,620
It’s nice.

1415
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:23,500
Adam, right?

1416
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:25,840
Yeah.

1417
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,380
Why are you
bleeding in the snow?

1418
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:28,590
That? No, l. . .

1419
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:31,300
I got stabbed
in the face
with a fork.

1420
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,800
I saw it coming
and I avoided it.
I mean, I didn't avoid it.

1421
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:37,930
It just happened again to me
in a slightly different way.

1422
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:41,520
Boy, I really wish
I knew what the fuck
you were talking about.

1423
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:45,730
All the choices
we make in our life,
they're pointless.

1424
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:47,690
There's no escaping
the inevitable.

1425
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:49,650
I don't know, man.

1426
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:55,910
So, you're saying
that your whole entire life
is predetermined to suck,

1427
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:57,200
no matter what you do?

1428
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,700
It’s not the way
I want it, but. . .

1429
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:01,450
Kind of seems like
a really, really good excuse

1430
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:04,620
to do something
totally amazing
right now, tonight.

1431
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,290
Like what?

1432
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:12,130
Like perhaps
hang out with a girl
that you just met

1433
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,590
before her bus
has to leave
in two hours?

1434
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:16,260
Right-o.

1435
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,970
I thought you said
we were going to
get some food.

1436
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:22,020
We are.
We're about to
get some food.

1437
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:24,690
I’m pretty hungry,
actually.

1438
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:27,100
Damn it.
They forgot to
leave the key.

1439
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:28,360
Who did?

1440
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,900
Carol and Stan Stapleton.
They're my friends.
They live here,

1441
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,780
and I housesit for them
when they go to Nepal,
sometimes.

1442
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:36,820
I thought you said
you came in here on a bus.

1443
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:39,990
They usually do leave,
like, a side door open.

1444
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,040
They do?
So let me. . .
I’ll be right back.

1445
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:43,370
Okay.

1446
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:44,750
(GLASS SHATTERING)

1447
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:46,710
APRIL:
Yep, it's unlocked.

1448
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:52,670
Cheers.

1449
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,380
So which one's Carol?

1450
00:57:58,350 --> 00:57:59,640
Carol's on the left.

1451
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,060
MALE ANNOUNCER:
Elway’s Last stand.
45 seconds Left on the clock.

1452
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:05,810
I’m really good
at getting head.
You'll see.

1453
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:08,480
Elway takes the snap.
Go, baby.

1454
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:11,820
He fades back. Elway fires.
He's got Jackson open.

1455
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,650
He's impossibly open!

1456
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,320
Wait, what's this? Vermin?

1457
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,900
No, no, no!
I know this squirrel.

1458
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:18,990
That's a magic
fucking squirrel.
This doesn't count.

1459
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:20,370
He's distracted
by a wild squirrel!

1460
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:21,490
LOU: What the fuck?

1461
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:24,450
Incomplete!
Game's over!
Cleveland wins!

1462
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:26,790
The Dawg Pound is going
to the Super Bowl.

1463
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:28,000
Oh, yeah!

1464
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,540
I've never seen
anything Like it!

1465
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,000
He did it. Got to go!

1466
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:33,500
Congratulations.
Look at all that money.

1467
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:36,800
I was kidding about
the blowjob thing.
Obviously, we're comedians.

1468
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,380
Hey, guys. Guys.

1469
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:40,470
A bet's a bet.

1470
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,600
Motherfucker!

1471
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:47,180
APRIL:
So you're a Time Lord?

1472
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:48,390
ADAM: Mmm-hmm.

1473
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,480
And a Jacuzzi is
your spaceship?

1474
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,520
That is correct, madam.

1475
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:55,440
That's the only part
of this whole thing

1476
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:57,190
that doesn't
make sense to me.

1477
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,740
You're not the only one.
Believe me.

1478
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:02,660
I mean, the whole thing
is just totally insane.

1479
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:03,830
Ew!

1480
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,080
So, how's the future
working out for you?

1481
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,670
I mean,
are you like
a happy grownup?

1482
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,040
Not particularly, no.

1483
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,130
Yeah.

1484
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:14,630
My friends actually
think I ended up being

1485
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:17,090
a completely selfish,
fucked-up person.

1486
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,880
And they may
have a point, actually,
if I think about it.

1487
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:21,010
Hmm. . .

1488
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:23,430
I’ll tell you something
I haven't told somebody
for a long time.

1489
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:24,890
When I was a kid,

1490
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:28,140
every Friday night,
my father used to take
my sister Kelly and me

1491
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:31,850
to this place
called Flatirons
for steak sandwiches.

1492
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:32,980
It was a family tradition.

1493
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,860
That's sometimes
a good thing.

1494
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:37,570
But one year,
we saw this commercial

1495
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,820
for this place called
The Enchanted
Forest of Pizza.

1496
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:45,120
So the next Friday,
my dad's loading
us up into the car.

1497
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:48,290
We're like, "Daddy, we want
to go to The Enchanted
Forest of Pizza."

1498
00:59:48,370 --> 00:59:50,080
And he's like,
"What are you talking about?

1499
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:52,170
"We always go for
steak sandwiches."

1500
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:53,920
But we just stay at him

1501
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,960
and we're whining,
and we're badgering,
and finally he relents.

1502
00:59:57,050 --> 00:59:58,510
Nice. So, you win.

1503
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:01,260
You deviated from the plan
in a really big way.
That's good.

1504
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:04,300
33 people died of E. coli.

1505
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,970
Including my father.

1506
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,640
Before he died,
he looked at me
and he said,

1507
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:11,310
"Adam, you did this."

1508
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,850
No, he didn't.

1509
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:14,190
Yes, he did,

1510
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:15,610
with his eyes.

1511
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:18,440
I don't think that
that's what he meant
with his eyes.

1512
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:22,450
The point is that Kelly and l
dealt with the guilt of this
in very different ways.

1513
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:24,030
She went wild, right?

1514
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,870
She didn't want
to have control
over anything.

1515
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:28,290
But I vowed
to master the chaos,

1516
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:30,120
to impose order.
Adam, I really don't think

1517
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:33,870
that you can
let a poison pizza ruin
the rest of your life.

1518
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:37,250
You got to
embrace the chaos.
You have to.

1519
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:40,970
That way,
life might just
astonish you.

1520
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:52,310
MAN 1:
I had so much fun tonight.
MAN 2: I know!

1521
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:53,730
Fuck! Game on.

1522
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:57,230
MAN 2:
You look so hot, by the way.
MAN 1: Thanks.

1523
01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:00,570
I said,
start sucking, gaylord.

1524
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,240
Yeah! Suck!

1525
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,450
MAN: Suck that shit, man!

1526
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:07,830
ALL: (CHANTING)
Suck! Suck! Suck!
Suck! Suck! Suck!

1527
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:09,830
Who are you people?

1528
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:12,200
God, who are you people?

1529
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:14,290
Let's get on with this.
My fondue's getting cold.

1530
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:15,880
MAN:
Choke on that horn, man!

1531
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:18,250
(GROANING)

1532
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:20,800
Oh!

1533
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,720
Wow, good for you.

1534
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:23,880
I know, right?

1535
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:26,510
It’s like Gary Coleman's
fucking forearm.

1536
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,600
It’s so black!

1537
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,180
It’s so impossibly black.

1538
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:34,640
I love you, buddy.
Don't say that!

1539
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:36,060
I’m sorry, I do.

1540
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:38,190
No, no, no!

1541
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,940
(CROWD CONTINUES CHANTING)

1542
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:52,540
Hey, you.

1543
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:55,210
Maybe what you need
isn't in here, after all.

1544
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:59,500
Maybe what you need
has always been in here.

1545
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,340
Really?
No.

1546
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,630

He's actually
a pretty cool guy.

We both love

Yeah, I just told
him a bunch of shit

1579
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:21,000
that's gonna make
him rich in the future.

I’m sorry, man.
I’m just preoccupied.

about being black and
out of shape?

No. Nick Webber,

Let's get it started

1701
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:19,020
Hey, where's
the Kodiak Club?

1702
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:20,400
Down the street, dude.

1703
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:22,360
Okay. Okay, thank you.

1704
01:09:22,530 --> 01:09:25,320
Listen, me and my boys
got some shit-kicking to do.

1705
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:26,990
But this

1706
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:29,830
(GRUNTING)

1707
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:31,410
ain't over.

1708
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,540
Get out of my way, stool.

1709
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,960
Transmit hits
with no delusion

1710
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,710
The feeling’s irresistible
And that's how we moving

1711
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,670
Everybody
Everybody

1712
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,010
Let's get into it

1713
01:09:43,090 --> 01:09:44,220
That's my boy,
right there.

1714
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:46,090
The singer?
Yeah.

1715
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:48,550
Let's get it started

1716
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:51,600
I’ll be back.
My friends are over there.
I’ll come right back.

1717
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:54,270
Lose control
Of body and soul

1718
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:56,850
Don't move too fast, people
Just take it slow

1719
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:59,400
I’m caught
right in the middle
of a thing right now,

1720
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:01,020
but can I text you later?

1721
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:02,860
Can you what?
Are you online at all?

1722
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:04,530
I have no idea
what you're saying.

1723
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:05,820
How do I get
a hold of you?

1724
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,860
You come find me.

1725
01:10:07,950 --> 01:10:09,120
That just sounds

1726
01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:11,080
exhausting.

1727
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:12,540
With no delusion
(CLOCK DINGS)

1728
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:15,160
The feeling’s irresistible
And that's how we moving

1729
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:17,040
There he is.
Where are your boys?

1730
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:18,880
I thought they were
gonna hold your sack.

1731
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,540
Let's kick his ass, Blaine.

1732
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:24,550
Where are my fucking friends?

1733
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,300
Whoo-hoo!
Let's get

1734
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:28,140
Whoo-hoo!
In here

1735
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:30,260
Let's get
Whoo-hoo!

1736
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:32,100
While I get
Whoo-hoo!

1737
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:34,730
You like that song?
Yeah, it's great.

1738
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:35,930
It’s gonna be a hit.

1739
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:47,450
And runnin' runnin'
And runnin' runnin'

(ALL CHEERING)

1741
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:55,120
Thank you. Thank you.

1742
01:10:56,790 --> 01:10:58,040
Yes.

1743
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,540
MAN: That was sweet.

1744
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:01,420
ADAM: All right.
All right, man.

1745
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:05,090
Good to have you back,
see you back up there, man.

1746
01:11:05,170 --> 01:11:07,260
Hey, it's coming back.
I should have
done this years ago.

1747
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:10,260
Guys. Adam. Guys!
About time.

1748
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:12,260
Did you see him?
Did you see him rock out?

1749
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:14,890
Shut up! Okay, we gotta
find the Chernobly
to get out of here.

1750
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:16,060
Chernobly? Why?

1751
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:17,270
I don't know, exactly.

1752
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:21,100
But the repairman said
it's got nitro-trainium. . .

1753
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:22,650
Nitratrinanium.
JACOB: Thank you.

1754
01:11:22,730 --> 01:11:25,360
Or some shit in it
that'll fix the time machine.

1755
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:27,360
That makes sense.
Where's Lou?

1756
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:29,530
ADAM: Where is. . .
What time is it?

1757
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:33,330
Fuck! Fuck! Shit! Shit!

1758
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,450
(GIRLS CHATTERING)

1759
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:37,080
Lou!

1760
01:11:38,710 --> 01:11:40,370
Where is he?
Fuck.

1761
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:44,630
ADAM: Oh, my God!
We missed it again!

1762
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:47,760
Well, where do you think
he went?

1763
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:51,050
Same place as last time?

1764
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:56,220
LOU: (SINGING)
Keeps me together at the seams

1765
01:11:56,390 --> 01:11:59,020
I'm on my way

1766
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:01,190
MAN 1: Shut up, you flamer!

1767
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:04,730
I'm on my way

1768
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:07,900
MAN 2: Hey, go home! Loser!

1769
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:09,990
Hey, John Lennon gets shot!

1770
01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:12,070
Wait, did that
already happen?

1771
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:15,660
ADAM: Lou!

1772
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,290
Whoo!

1773
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:23,580
They made it, everybody!
Whoo!
Best friends in the world!

1774
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:25,130
Almost just in time!

1775
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,210
My buddies.

1776
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:31,510
Fucking Chimney Point, right?
Here we are.

1777
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,930
Bottle of scotch,
end of the night.

1778
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:36,970
Where were you?

1779
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:38,640
We were just. . .
We came. . .

1780
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,730
Not tonight.
Every fucking night.

1781
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:44,400
Huh? What happened?
We were gonna do
shit together, man.

1782
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:47,480
We were gonna
conquer the fucking world.
Me and you.

1783
01:12:47,570 --> 01:12:48,980
And then you cut me off.

1784
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:50,190
What was l
gonna do, man?

1785
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,950
I was gonna let you
drag me down into
your bullshit, Lou?

1786
01:12:53,110 --> 01:12:55,200
Yeah. Yes, because
that's what friends do.

1787
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,700
No, they don't, man!

1788
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:58,450
Because then
there's two people
stuck in the bullshit

1789
01:12:58,540 --> 01:12:59,700
instead of your sorry ass.

1790
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:03,960
You should
stick by your friends
through thick and thin!

1791
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:10,630
Okay, great.
I got two things
to say to you.

1792
01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:12,380
Okay.
Okay?

1793
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:15,140
Number one, I hate you.

1794
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,600
Got it.

1795
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:18,470
Our friendship
means nothing.

1796
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:20,930
All right,
is that the first thing
or the second thing?

1797
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:23,480
What?
No, clearly that's still
part of the first thing.

1798
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:24,980
I mean, am I the asshole?
Did you get that?

1799
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:26,730
No, I didn't get it.
I thought. . .
He didn't get it.

1800
01:13:26,810 --> 01:13:28,060
He said A and B. . .

1801
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:30,570
Let's agree to disagree
about the "first" thing.

1802
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:33,950
Lou, where is the Chernobly?
We need it to get back.

1803
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:35,950
(IN MOCKING TONE)
"Where's the Chernobly
at, Lou?"

1804
01:13:36,030 --> 01:13:38,240
That's all you ever
fucking care about.

1805
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:39,580
It’s the first time
he mentioned it.

1806
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:41,240
Yeah, and even if we had
mentioned it before,

1807
01:13:41,330 --> 01:13:44,080
it's kind of
a fucking big deal, okay?
I wanna go home.

1808
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:45,620

Let's talk about this inside.

You got no shoes on.
It’s cold out.

Who took my fucking shoe?

1811
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:51,050
Blaine apparently
beat your shoe
off of you,

1812
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:53,090
which I don't even know how
that could fucking happen.

1813

fucking thing, okay?

Blaine's got the Chernobly.

so we can
get back to the present

you bitches again.

01:29:45,330 --> 01:29:46,380
It looks great.

2164
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:48,880
Anyhow, I have instructions
on how to get home.

2165
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,250
We know how to get home.

2166
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:51,710
Yeah. We know. . .

2167
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:54,630
Mr. Dorchen anticipated
that you might say that,

2168
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:57,600
so I took the liberty
of printing up some
Lougle maps for you.

2169
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:59,560
You mean "Google"?
PHIL: Lougle maps.

2170
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:01,770
What's the matter
with you guys?

2171
01:30:01,850 --> 01:30:03,310
(LAUGHING)

2172
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:06,270
NICK: Fuck me.

2173
01:30:06,350 --> 01:30:09,400
So, Phil, if you wanna find,
you know, like porno

2174
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:12,280
or a restaurant review
or anything like that,
you use Lougle?

2175
01:30:12,530 --> 01:30:13,690
Correct.

2176
01:30:13,990 --> 01:30:16,160
I bet he's on
the Statue of Liberty
and shit, too.

2177
01:30:20,490 --> 01:30:22,120
You want me
to go in there?

2178
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:24,460
NICK: That's what
it says on the map.

2179
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:28,250
Call me later.

2180
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,130
Hello.

2181
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,890
Welcome back, Mr. Webber.
How was your time away?

2182
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:41,810
Uh. . .

2183
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:46,730
Hey, how was the trip?

2184
01:30:47,020 --> 01:30:50,110
(ONCE IN A LIFETIME PLAYING)

2185
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,690
Good.

2186
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:55,150
MAN: (SINGING)
Letting the days go by

2187
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:57,320
Let the water hold me down

2188
01:30:57,410 --> 01:30:59,280
Letting the days go by

2189
01:30:59,370 --> 01:31:01,450
Water flowing underground

2190
01:31:01,530 --> 01:31:03,490
Into the blue again

2191
01:31:03,580 --> 01:31:05,450
After the money's gone

2192
01:31:05,540 --> 01:31:07,500
Once in a lifetime

2193
01:31:07,580 --> 01:31:10,330
Water flowing underground

2194
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:11,710
Motherfucker.

2195
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:14,050
Nick?

2196
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:17,720
Baby, how was your weekend?
I wasn't expecting you today.

2197
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:22,550
Baby. Baby.
I got something
to tell you.

2198
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:25,680
I know about what you did
with a guy named Steve.

2199
01:31:26,890 --> 01:31:29,600
Steve?
Our receptionist?

2200
01:31:29,770 --> 01:31:31,730
That Tyrese-looking
motherfucker out there?

2201
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:35,070
Baby, wait a minute.
What are you talking about?

2202
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:36,820
You think I’m
fooling around?

2203
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:39,700
First of all,
I would never
screw around.

2204
01:31:40,070 --> 01:31:43,780
And you remember I told you
about that crazy wrong number
I got when I was nine.

2205
01:31:43,870 --> 01:31:45,370
That man was so. . .
I love you, Courtney.

2206
01:31:45,450 --> 01:31:47,160
I love you so much.

2207
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:49,370
I love you, too,
Nick Webber.

2208
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:51,290
Nick Webber?

2209
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:53,250
That's your name.

2210
01:31:54,380 --> 01:31:56,090
Yeah, it is my name.

2211
01:31:56,670 --> 01:31:57,670
Yeah.

2212
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,930
You know my name.
Say it again.

2213
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:01,180
Nick

2214
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:02,680
Webber.
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

2215
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:05,600
Grab that.
I’ll take this one.

2216
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:07,890
Hey, Mom.
I made you a drink.

2217
01:32:08,180 --> 01:32:09,690
Is there alcohol in that?

2218
01:32:09,770 --> 01:32:11,440
Yeah, I believe
there's still
alcohol in scotch.

2219
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:14,980
Talk about your
lost weekend, huh?

2220
01:32:15,070 --> 01:32:16,940
I know, right? Man.

2221
01:32:17,650 --> 01:32:19,650
Hey, family.

2222
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:22,570
What are you faggots
talking about?

2223
01:32:22,740 --> 01:32:24,620
My two handsome men.

2224
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:26,700
Let me get you
another drink, Dad.

2225
01:32:27,450 --> 01:32:29,080
Daddy's little buddy.

2226
01:32:30,790 --> 01:32:32,420
You know what
I can't believe?

2227
01:32:32,790 --> 01:32:34,420
I can't believe
we're all here.

2228
01:32:34,590 --> 01:32:36,130
I can't believe
we all made it.

2229
01:32:36,630 --> 01:32:37,800
Made it together.

2230
01:32:38,130 --> 01:32:39,470
A toast.
APRIL: A toast.

2231
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:41,880
Approximately
three days ago,
or 20 years,

2232
01:32:41,970 --> 01:32:44,800
depending on your
understanding of the
time-space continuum, Jacob,

2233
01:32:45,850 --> 01:32:48,520
sitting here with you guys
would have been
my worst nightmare.

2234
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:49,850
It’s true.

2235
01:32:49,930 --> 01:32:51,770
But I can honestly
say right now

2236
01:32:52,230 --> 01:32:56,070
I’m very happy
to be right here
in this moment with you,

2237
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:57,980
my best friends.
APRIL: Hear, hear.

2238
01:32:58,070 --> 01:32:59,110
To friends.

2239
01:32:59,190 --> 01:33:00,240
And family.

2240
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:01,820
ADAM: All right. Cheers!

2241
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:03,360
To past, present and future.

2242
01:33:03,660 --> 01:33:05,410
ALL: Cheers!

2243
01:33:05,490 --> 01:33:06,450
JACOB: So, "Lougle," huh?

2244
01:33:06,530 --> 01:33:07,580
Yeah.

2245
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:11,000
Lougle.
Just this multibillion-dollar
thing I did for a while.

2246
01:33:11,790 --> 01:33:15,000
My real
passion's music, though.
So pissed the band broke up.

2247
01:33:15,170 --> 01:33:17,500
Band? What band
were you ever in?

2248
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:20,550
(HOME SWEET HOME PLAYING)

2249
01:33:29,310 --> 01:33:32,680
(SINGING)
You know I'm a dreamer

2250
01:33:32,850 --> 01:33:36,060
But my heart's of gold

2251
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:39,270
I had to run away high

2252
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:41,900
So I wouldn’t come home Low

2253
01:33:42,030 --> 01:33:45,110
Just when things went right

2254
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:48,120
Doesn't mean
they were always wrong

2255
01:33:48,450 --> 01:33:52,660
Just take this song
and you’ll never feel

2256
01:33:52,830 --> 01:33:54,710
Left all alone

2257
01:33:54,790 --> 01:33:57,840
Take me to your heart

2258
01:33:58,170 --> 01:34:00,800
Feel me in your bones

2259
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:03,170
Just one more night

2260
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:07,850
And I'm coming off this
Long and winding road

2261
01:34:10,850 --> 01:34:16,520
I'm on my way

2262
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:20,070
Home sweet home

2263
01:34:21,070 --> 01:34:23,320
Tonight, tonight

2264
01:34:23,490 --> 01:34:28,990
I'm on my way

2265
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:32,240
Home sweet home

2266
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:38,880
You know that I've seen

2267
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:41,670
Too many romantic dreams

2268
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:43,920
Up in Lights

2269
01:34:44,010 --> 01:34:47,720
falling off the silver screen

2270
01:34:48,390 --> 01:34:50,850
My heart's
Like an open book

2271
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:54,060
For the whole world to read

2272
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:58,690
Sometimes nothing
keeps me together

2273
01:34:58,770 --> 01:35:00,520
at the seams

2274
01:35:00,610 --> 01:35:06,530
I'm on my way

2275
01:35:06,610 --> 01:35:10,370
Home sweet home

2276
01:35:11,450 --> 01:35:12,700
Yeah

2277
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:16,120
I'm on my way

2278
01:35:16,290 --> 01:35:18,960
Just set me free

2279
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:24,130
Home sweet home
