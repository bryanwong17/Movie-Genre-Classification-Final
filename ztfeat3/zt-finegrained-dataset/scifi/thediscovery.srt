00:00:28,766 --> 00:00:30,268
[woman] <i>Dr. Harber, 
before we're live,</i>

2
00:00:30,351 --> 00:00:32,729
<i>I just wanted to say thank you</i>
<i>for choosing me.</i>

3
00:00:32,812 --> 00:00:34,856
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

4
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:37,275
[woman] <i>The rich history you have</i>
<i>with other journalists...</i>

5
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,403
[Harber] <i>I chose you precisely</i>
<i>because we don't have a history.</i>

6
00:00:41,863 --> 00:00:43,406
Now, don't fuck it up.

7
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:46,617
[woman 2] Fifteen seconds.

8
00:00:49,704 --> 00:00:54,459
People trust you...
for decades have valued you.

9
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:56,919
I think that's because
people value the truth.

10
00:00:57,003 --> 00:01:01,507
Right, but don't you think
your discovery was just... too dangerous

11
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:02,800
to share with the world?

12
00:01:02,884 --> 00:01:05,637
Look, this has been my life's work
for over 40 years.

13
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,263
There's nothing willy-nilly here.

14
00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:11,142
After much discussion, much debate,
we all came to the same conclusion.

15
00:01:11,225 --> 00:01:13,102
-Which is?
-Which is, once you explore

16
00:01:13,186 --> 00:01:16,147
all scientific possibilities,
and you come to a consensus,

17
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:20,318
how can you keep a discovery
so vital to our existence a secret?

18
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,320
And that discovery...

19
00:01:23,446 --> 00:01:25,990
You proved the existence of an afterlife.

20
00:01:26,074 --> 00:01:29,494
I prefer to call it
a new plane of existence.

21
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,998
I can't comment on terminology
like "soul" and "heaven" and "afterlife,"

22
00:01:34,082 --> 00:01:38,086
but what I can say with scientific
certainty is that once the body dies,

23
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:43,174
some part of our consciousness
leaves us and travels to a new plane.

24
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:49,013
Your machine was able
to capture brain wavelengths

25
00:01:49,097 --> 00:01:52,850
on a subatomic level,
leaving the body after death.

26
00:01:53,685 --> 00:01:55,436
-Is that...?
-That's correct.

27
00:01:57,397 --> 00:01:59,732
Where do those wavelengths go?

28
00:02:01,526 --> 00:02:05,154
My point is,
a new plane of existence is out there.

29
00:02:05,238 --> 00:02:07,573
Yes, that is no longer in dispute.

30
00:02:07,657 --> 00:02:10,535
But you can't tell us
what that is exactly.

31
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:13,079
When you see a train leave the station...

32
00:02:14,163 --> 00:02:17,542
do you need to know where it's going
to understand that you saw it leave?

33
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,877
It's a tough pill to swallow.

34
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:22,130
At one point,
so was the Earth being round.

35
00:02:23,506 --> 00:02:29,011
But, Dr. Harber, why did it take you
six months to address us?

36
00:02:29,512 --> 00:02:30,930
Where have you been?

37
00:02:31,931 --> 00:02:35,810
It seems to me
that I invited you here, to my home.

38
00:02:35,893 --> 00:02:37,812
Yes, you did. Thank you.

39
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:41,441
But... we only received that invitation

40
00:02:41,524 --> 00:02:45,027
after the suicide toll
had rapidly reached a million.

41
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:48,698
And during that time,
celebrities, athletes,

42
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:52,785
even a close colleague of yours,
all ended their lives.

43
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:56,581
Which is why I agreed to sit with you
and try to calm the waters.

44
00:02:57,748 --> 00:02:58,875
Okay.

45
00:03:00,084 --> 00:03:01,544
I wanna ask you the question

46
00:03:01,627 --> 00:03:04,922
that everybody watching right now
is probably wondering.

47
00:03:05,631 --> 00:03:10,011
Do you feel responsible
for all those people killing themselves?

48
00:03:10,761 --> 00:03:11,596
No.

49
00:03:13,055 --> 00:03:14,932
-That's it?
-That's it.

50
00:03:16,893 --> 00:03:20,313
[man] Thank you, Dr. Harber...
for my fresh start.

51
00:03:20,396 --> 00:03:21,772
[woman 1] Andy, no!

52
00:03:22,356 --> 00:03:23,608
Andy!

53
00:03:23,691 --> 00:03:24,942

-[woman 2] Oh, no.

-Why would you do that?
-[woman 2] Somebody call 911.

56
00:03:28,988 --> 00:03:30,156
[woman 1] Help! Some....

57
00:03:30,406 --> 00:03:31,574

58

Right now. Get someone here.

59
00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:35,036
My God!

60
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:36,496
Why would you do that?

61
00:03:36,871 --> 00:03:38,122
Oh, God.

62
00:03:38,873 --> 00:03:40,500
Turn those cameras off.

I'm sorry, I thought--
I thought that I was alone.

Hi.

82
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:46,959
Hi.

83
00:05:50,838 --> 00:05:52,381
Are you one of those lunatics

84
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:55,926
who just sits next to a complete stranger
in an empty movie theater?

85
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,678
You look so familiar to me.

86
00:05:57,762 --> 00:05:59,263
It's possible we've met,

87
00:05:59,347 --> 00:06:01,515
but you don't have
a memorable face.

88
00:06:02,642 --> 00:06:04,101
Okay. [chuckles]

89

I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that.
I didn't mean that. I just...

00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,067
The water. I'm just a little seasick.

91
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:16,989
That's weird. It's your lucky day.
I don't normally carry these around.

92
00:06:17,073 --> 00:06:17,990
Um...

93
00:06:19,742 --> 00:06:21,243
-Vertigo.
-I'm not dizzy.

94
00:06:21,577 --> 00:06:24,705
You can't treat vertigo, just the effects.
That's for nausea.

95
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:32,546
Do I look like the kind of girl who's just
gonna take a pill from some strange guy?

96
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:33,964
Fair enough.

97
00:06:43,265 --> 00:06:45,142
Isla. My name's Isla.

98
00:06:46,143 --> 00:06:48,104
I don't look like an Isla, though.

99
00:06:48,187 --> 00:06:49,563
Your first three years,

100
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:51,565
you look like whatever name you're given,

101
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:54,402
then by four, you either settle
into your name or you just...

-What about you?
-What?

103
00:06:58,114 --> 00:06:59,240
What's your name?

Oh, uh, Will Stevenson.

What?

107
00:07:07,415 --> 00:07:09,709
I'm just trying to see
if you look like your name.

108
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:13,129
-What's the verdict there?
-I don't know.

109
00:07:14,588 --> 00:07:15,798
It's too early to tell.

110
00:07:16,674 --> 00:07:20,219
You know,
Will is just such a, like, "Will" name.

Happy second Discovery anniversary, Will.

114
00:07:27,018 --> 00:07:30,521
They said on the news they're expecting
like a whole slew of suicides today.

115

People trying to get there
for the anniversary.

116
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,608
I heard something about that.

117
00:07:34,692 --> 00:07:36,944
Did you see that video
of those dumb cheerleaders

118
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:38,696
taking pills on the 50-yard line?

119
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:41,449
I just can't get behind the concept
of suicide groups.

120
00:07:41,532 --> 00:07:47,079
It's so... disingenuous, you know?
It just feels so weak.

121
00:07:47,663 --> 00:07:51,208
-You don't believe in the Discovery?
-No, I don't believe in suicide groups.

122
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:54,378
The Discovery is--
I mean, the proof is overwhelming.

123
00:07:54,462 --> 00:07:57,548
Proof shouldn't be overwhelming.
Proof should be definitive.

124
00:07:58,299 --> 00:07:59,508
So, you don't believe.

125
00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:05,139
I don't believe the way
everybody else does. No, I don't.

126
00:08:05,222 --> 00:08:08,017
-And how's that?
-I'm a neurologist.

127
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,936
Three months ago,
I had a patient, really young,

128
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,981
found out that she had brain cancer.
Very sad.

129
00:08:14,565 --> 00:08:16,108
She reacted to that diagnosis

130
00:08:16,192 --> 00:08:18,861
as though I'd handed her
a fucking winning lottery ticket.

131
00:08:19,445 --> 00:08:22,656
It wasn't because she hoped that
maybe she was going someplace better.

132
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,619
It was because the Discovery
made her think that it was guaranteed.

133
00:08:26,702 --> 00:08:29,747
Well, yeah. Death used to be something
we just had to live with,

134
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:33,209
and now it's a convenient way
to escape pain. That's okay.

135
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:36,253
That's okay?
Another plane of existence, maybe.

136
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:39,965
Who knows? But I look around, I see
a lot of people jumping out of planes

137
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:41,759
hoping they're gonna grow wings.

138
00:08:42,176 --> 00:08:44,720
Reality and fantasy
are mutually exclusive.

I told my parents that I saw something.

Stranded where?

148
00:09:31,851 --> 00:09:34,854
This empty beach.
It doesn't matter. It was a dream.

149
00:09:36,105 --> 00:09:38,399
It was a dream that I embellished
after I woke up.

Why would you make all that up?

152
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:49,410
I think it's our instinct
to search for meaning,

153
00:09:49,493 --> 00:09:52,413
and when there is none,
it's our instinct to create meaning

154
00:09:52,496 --> 00:09:56,292
and we just... lie. We lie to ourselves.

155

Has anyone ever told you that?

156
00:10:02,631 --> 00:10:04,258
Yeah, they have.

157
00:10:04,842 --> 00:10:07,136
Ugh. Thank God we only have
a minute left together

158
00:10:07,219 --> 00:10:08,596
before we're strangers again.

159
00:10:09,513 --> 00:10:12,641
You think it's gonna be a minute
this time of year? You're crazy.

[vehicle approaching]

161
00:10:18,105 --> 00:10:18,981
Crazy, but right.

162
00:10:19,064 --> 00:10:22,359
That's the attractive-girl component
and I didn't factor that in.

163
00:10:22,443 --> 00:10:24,069
[Isla] You'd better work on your math.

164
00:10:26,822 --> 00:10:27,698
Hey!

165
00:10:28,616 --> 00:10:31,952
For whatever it's worth,
I think you do look like an Isla.

166
00:10:32,494 --> 00:10:34,413
How many of us have you met?

167
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,459
[Isla chuckles]

168
00:10:40,377 --> 00:10:41,378

[country music playing over stereo]

171
00:11:15,788 --> 00:11:17,790
-I got it.
-No, I got it, man.

172
00:11:17,873 --> 00:11:20,459
Well, I don't want to die
before we get there, Toby.

173
00:11:31,553 --> 00:11:33,973
-What's going on over here?
-Eddie.

174
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:38,519
-Wait, Eddie Iodice? Eddie died?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah, just to get there.

175
00:11:40,187 --> 00:11:41,855
Just to fucking get there.

177
00:11:44,608 --> 00:11:47,361

[chuckles]

179
00:11:50,572 --> 00:11:51,573
Good dude, too.

180
00:11:52,449 --> 00:11:54,660
-Real pity.
-You didn't wanna go to the service?

181
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:00,708
Go to the...? I would rather stick
my dick in a wood chipper

182
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,335
-than go to another fucking funeral.
-Got it.

183
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:13,012
You know, I'm not as stupid
as you might think.

184
00:12:14,263 --> 00:12:16,807
When you called the other day
and I told you

185
00:12:17,182 --> 00:12:18,809
that Dad had built something new...

186
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,270
after that conversation...

187
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:24,523
suddenly you wanted to come home.

188
00:12:27,484 --> 00:12:31,238
-You're sounding just as paranoid as him.
-[chuckles]

[Toby] <i>Dad said he needed</i>

190
00:12:41,665 --> 00:12:44,001

193
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:04,646
Here we are.

194
00:13:15,491 --> 00:13:17,576
Off to see the wizard.

195
00:13:28,003 --> 00:13:29,421
[Will] What the fuck is this place?

196
00:13:32,508 --> 00:13:37,054
Uh, it used to be a summer camp
for "troubled youths."

197
00:13:38,055 --> 00:13:41,100
Which I never really understood,
because if they're bad kids,

198
00:13:41,183 --> 00:13:44,603
why would they deserve a fun summer?
You know?

199
00:13:45,979 --> 00:13:48,398
But then it shut down
and Dad bought it.

200
00:13:50,734 --> 00:13:51,819
What do you think?

201
00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:54,404
[Will] I think it's completely insane.

202
00:13:56,115 --> 00:14:01,203
Well, the truth is we just needed
a lot more space to house things.

203
00:14:02,538 --> 00:14:03,705
House what things?

204
00:14:05,624 --> 00:14:08,961
[Toby] These people were all affected
by the Discovery.

205
00:14:10,003 --> 00:14:13,882
Some of them arrived here after two
or three failed suicide attempts.

206
00:14:14,508 --> 00:14:15,884
We gave them a home,

207
00:14:15,968 --> 00:14:19,930
something to live for in this life,
a reason to contribute.

208
00:14:33,694 --> 00:14:35,446
Oh, uh, real quick.

209
00:14:35,988 --> 00:14:40,492
Just FYI, FBI-type thing,
protocol is no cell phones.

-Yeah, okay. Let's go.
-Yeah.

00:14:51,253 --> 00:14:52,087
Hey, don't worry.

[equipment beeping]

214
00:15:00,762 --> 00:15:02,181
[man] This is truly thrilling.

215
00:15:02,347 --> 00:15:04,641
I can only compare it
to the model train set

216
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:07,394
you let me assemble by myself
on my birthday.

[Toby] Oh, well, you know me.
Pins and needles, needles and pins.

219

These goddamn machines.

-Who the hell's that?
-His other son just returned.

221
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:28,207
Surprisingly taller than I remember.

222
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:30,417
Good to see you again, Cooper.

223
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,836
Will, Lacey. Lacey...

224
00:15:34,296 --> 00:15:35,130
That went well.

225
00:15:36,507 --> 00:15:37,549
Where's Dad?

226
00:15:50,646 --> 00:15:53,023
-Is he dead?
-No, of course not.

227
00:15:54,358 --> 00:15:55,692
He is now.

228
00:15:55,776 --> 00:15:57,486
-[Lacey] Fifteen seconds.
-Dad?

[alarm beeping]

230
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,573
Take it easy.
They're just running some tests.

231
00:16:01,657 --> 00:16:03,492
-It's all routine.
-Ten seconds.

232
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:06,453

See, they're recharging the body
to reboot the brain.

235
00:16:13,377 --> 00:16:17,214
The longest he's ever officially under is,
like, 60 seconds.

So, Dad is now killing himself
and electroshocking back to life.

240
00:16:49,955 --> 00:16:50,789
No.

241
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:53,792
Kind of.

242
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:57,254
But you're...
You're looking at this all wrong.

243
00:16:57,921 --> 00:17:01,633
You're wearing whatever the opposite of...
What is it? Rose-colored glasses.

244
00:17:01,717 --> 00:17:03,051
That's what you're wearing.

245
00:17:03,135 --> 00:17:04,469
Shit-colored glasses.

246
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:07,514
Anyway, you shouldn't worry,

247
00:17:07,598 --> 00:17:11,393
because all of this is being
closely monitored and controlled.

248
00:17:12,102 --> 00:17:16,440
And we both know you've always been
slightly skeptical of everything.

249
00:17:16,523 --> 00:17:18,066
Dad started a cult.

250
00:17:18,984 --> 00:17:21,028
-No.
-Can you not see that? This is a cult.

251
00:17:21,111 --> 00:17:24,197
All the way down to these followers
in different-colored jumpsuits.

252
00:17:24,281 --> 00:17:28,035
No, no, no.
There's no hierarchy here, Will.

253
00:17:28,118 --> 00:17:32,039
Dad calls it... distinctions in clearance.

254
00:17:32,122 --> 00:17:35,626
-That's all. It's not a cult.
-It should be different. Straitjackets.

255
00:17:36,126 --> 00:17:38,754
You're the one
that wanted to come back here

256
00:17:38,837 --> 00:17:41,381
for whatever reason. Right?

257
00:17:41,465 --> 00:17:45,636
Now, that, right there,
is the million-dollar question.

258
00:17:46,386 --> 00:17:47,346
Welcome back, Will.

You mind telling me something?

What are you doing back here?

263
00:18:06,323 --> 00:18:08,450
I'm here because I want you to stop it.

264
00:18:09,284 --> 00:18:12,120
I'm asking you
just to put an end to all this.

265
00:18:12,371 --> 00:18:13,664
How would I do that?

266
00:18:15,207 --> 00:18:16,625
Say that you were wrong.

267
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:18,835
Take it all back.

268
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:21,630
I can't take it back, Will,
because it's the truth.

269
00:18:21,713 --> 00:18:22,923
Who knows better than you?

270
00:18:23,006 --> 00:18:25,509
You were the inspiration for this.
Aren't you curious?

271
00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:27,969
Please, don't say that. That's not...

272
00:18:28,887 --> 00:18:31,848
-I wasn't.
-Ah, but you were. Hang on.

"Therefore, it is my belief

275
00:18:44,444 --> 00:18:45,487
-Please don't.
-Hang on.

276

It gets good.

-I was wrong.
-You don't believe that.

281
00:18:59,376 --> 00:19:01,002
We were wrong, Dad.

282
00:19:01,753 --> 00:19:03,922
We were wrong
because a lot of people died.

283
00:19:05,173 --> 00:19:08,969
And a whole lot more people
are gonna kill themselves...

284
00:19:09,678 --> 00:19:13,265
while you experiment here
in this ridiculous fortress.

285
00:19:13,348 --> 00:19:16,309
So, just slamming on the brakes
of 40 years' work?

286
00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:19,271
I'd be saying I'm responsible.

287
00:19:19,855 --> 00:19:20,689
Maybe you are.

288
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,733
So, you think I've gone too far?

289
00:19:24,568 --> 00:19:26,486
Well, I don't think I've gone far enough.

290

knowing you were gonna do this.

You don't get to just change that!

00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,643
<i>that this will all be perceived</i>
<i>unfavorably by some.</i>

314
00:22:44,726 --> 00:22:47,062
[Will] <i>She was going</i>
<i>to catch pneumonia, Toby.</i>

315
00:22:47,437 --> 00:22:50,273
[Toby] <i>I still don't know</i>
<i>what you want me to do with her.</i>

316
00:22:50,357 --> 00:22:54,569
[Will] <i>You told me that you take in people</i>
<i>who need help. She needs help.</i>

317
00:22:54,653 --> 00:22:57,947
She still can't just stay here.
We have rules.

318
00:22:58,031 --> 00:23:02,035
Then can we make an exception...
in her case, please?

319
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,162
We're talking about somebody's life.

320
00:23:04,245 --> 00:23:08,041
We have no idea
if she will attempt or try to...

321
00:23:09,542 --> 00:23:10,752
Kill myself again?

322
00:23:12,087 --> 00:23:15,215
You can say it. I know what happened.
I was there when you ruined it.

323
00:23:15,298 --> 00:23:17,133
She and I have been getting along great.

324
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:19,761
We still have rules.

325
00:23:19,844 --> 00:23:22,430
She has to talk to Dad,
and she has to take the questionnaire.

326
00:23:22,514 --> 00:23:23,682
What's the questionnaire?

327
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:26,351
-Um...
-Can we be...?

328
00:23:29,979 --> 00:23:31,147
Will, you have a visitor.

329
00:23:32,732 --> 00:23:34,984
Your dad is Thomas Harber?

330
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:41,574
[Harber] So, nobody but the conductor,

331
00:23:41,658 --> 00:23:44,077
which is me,
is gonna know your answers.

332
00:23:44,828 --> 00:23:47,038
Everything is completely discreet here.

333
00:23:48,707 --> 00:23:51,126
And now Lacey will be giving us
some privacy.

334
00:23:53,837 --> 00:23:57,132
It used to be about global exploration,
you know, discovering new land,

335
00:23:57,215 --> 00:23:58,550
and then it was space travel.

336
00:23:58,967 --> 00:24:01,553
Shining a light on the dark corners
of the universe.

337
00:24:02,095 --> 00:24:04,764
And now it's exploring
what comes after this life.

338
00:24:06,433 --> 00:24:08,643
Seeing what's next. How old are you?

339
00:24:10,311 --> 00:24:12,689
[man on recording]
<i>You are all part of the same thing.</i>

340
00:24:13,148 --> 00:24:14,232
<i>Cells in a body.</i>

341
00:24:14,649 --> 00:24:16,234
<i>Waves in the ocean.</i>

342
00:24:17,485 --> 00:24:19,904
<i>The soul isn't young or old.</i>

343
00:24:22,824 --> 00:24:26,786
[Harber] Do you accept the fact that time
is a nonlinear illusion created by man?

344
00:24:27,746 --> 00:24:29,748
Pass. I don't know what that means.

345
00:24:29,831 --> 00:24:32,500
There are no right or wrong answers
to this questionnaire.

346
00:24:32,584 --> 00:24:36,004
-Then why do you bother giving it?
-That's a good response.

347
00:24:37,464 --> 00:24:41,259
[Harber] <i>Okay, greatest ability...</i>
<i>and most disappointing weakness.</i>

348
00:24:42,427 --> 00:24:45,221
[Isla] <i>I guess I'm good at seeing</i>
<i>what makes somebody tick.</i>

349
00:24:45,847 --> 00:24:47,432
<i>Understanding who they really are.</i>

350
00:24:48,433 --> 00:24:49,517
[Harber] Weakness?

351
00:24:49,601 --> 00:24:52,562
I'm able to understand them,
but I'm not able to care about them.

352
00:24:53,104 --> 00:24:55,774
If somebody mentions "subconscious"
to you, what do you think?

353
00:24:56,357 --> 00:24:58,234
-Memory.
-Dig deeper.

354
00:24:59,277 --> 00:25:02,781
-Hidden memory.
-Would you say that you suppress emotions?

355
00:25:03,364 --> 00:25:05,700
I don't really like talking
about myself like this.

356
00:25:05,784 --> 00:25:08,870
You don't have to like it.
We think about ourselves every day.

357
00:25:08,953 --> 00:25:12,832
Everything is from our own perspective.
So, as much as you may not want

358
00:25:12,916 --> 00:25:15,084
to indulge yourself in looking
at your most inner thoughts,

359
00:25:15,168 --> 00:25:17,629
they're there.
Make no mistake. They are there.

360
00:25:23,092 --> 00:25:26,554
[Harber] <i>Do you believe in a soul?</i>
<i>If not, close your eyes.</i>

361
00:25:29,891 --> 00:25:33,561
<i>Great. Let's just say a soul does exist.</i>
<i>Where in the body do you think it'd be?</i>

362
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:37,690
I think if there's a soul,
it would belong in the brain.

363
00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:39,818
[machine beeps]

364
00:25:40,527 --> 00:25:41,528
[Harber] Wow.

365
00:25:42,237 --> 00:25:44,656
Now, that's interesting.
Most people say the stomach.

366
00:25:44,739 --> 00:25:46,157
But I like that you didn't.

367
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:57,210
[Harber]
<i>Have you ever experienced sudden loss?</i>

368
00:25:58,586 --> 00:25:59,462
Yes.

369
00:26:00,213 --> 00:26:04,509
And what aspect of regaining normalcy
after losing someone...

370
00:26:06,427 --> 00:26:07,762
was the most difficult?

371
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:14,435
Inanimate objects, maybe? Like...

372
00:26:16,145 --> 00:26:18,481
<i>my coffee table. I've had it for years</i>

373
00:26:18,565 --> 00:26:22,527
and I've probably looked at it
a million times, but after he--

374
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:27,615
Familiar objects just became
distorted and unfamiliar.

375
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:31,995
I started to hate my ceiling fan,
my cereal bowl, my tea kettle.

376
00:26:34,873 --> 00:26:36,082
[Harber] <i>Okay, last question.</i>

377
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:39,335
Are you legitimately suicidal?

378
00:26:45,008 --> 00:26:48,303
If you knew what came after...
this life...

379
00:26:49,304 --> 00:26:51,347
do you think it would affect
your decision-making

380
00:26:51,431 --> 00:26:53,558
or maybe even make you change
your mind?

381
00:26:54,726 --> 00:26:57,228
Maybe. Knowing could change things.

382
00:27:05,695 --> 00:27:07,864
How'd you know
this is where you'd be staying?

383
00:27:10,325 --> 00:27:11,534
I found our old bed.

384
00:27:11,743 --> 00:27:12,952
Yeah, I see that.

385
00:27:13,036 --> 00:27:15,997
And you should thank me...
by the way, because

386
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,123
[grunts]

387
00:27:17,206 --> 00:27:19,834
I fought long and hard
to keep old faithful here.

388
00:27:22,378 --> 00:27:23,296
How's Isla?

389
00:27:25,131 --> 00:27:29,469
Oh... That's actually why I'm here.
Will, she's dead.

390
00:27:30,637 --> 00:27:34,349
No, she's not. She's not dead.
That was a bad joke.

391
00:27:34,432 --> 00:27:37,727
Um... But the questionnaire is
all wrapped up.

392
00:27:39,062 --> 00:27:40,063
She can stay.

393
00:27:41,272 --> 00:27:44,108
Yeah, good. She needs to be looked after.
She could try again.

394
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:49,113
I don't think
that's going to happen, Will.

395
00:27:55,703 --> 00:27:56,955
[sighs]

396
00:27:58,414 --> 00:27:59,916
Because tonight...

397
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:03,086
everything changes.

398
00:28:04,337 --> 00:28:07,256
We finally unveil it.

399
00:28:07,966 --> 00:28:09,384
What is "it," Toby?

400
00:28:12,011 --> 00:28:15,390
Dad wanted me to invite you
to a little gathering tonight,

401
00:28:15,473 --> 00:28:17,517
just a select group.

402
00:28:20,353 --> 00:28:22,397
Boy, this is nothing
like our old house, huh?

403
00:28:33,282 --> 00:28:36,411
It sounds to me
a lot like you're advocating murder.

404
00:28:37,078 --> 00:28:40,456
I'm not advocating murder.
I'm just pointing out that most people

405
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,293
don't look at ending somebody else's life
the way they do their own.

406
00:28:45,503 --> 00:28:47,422
[sighing] Where is he?

407
00:28:48,673 --> 00:28:49,966
It's about to happen.

408
00:28:50,508 --> 00:28:53,678
I can't tell when you're talking to me
or that. It's really annoying.

409
00:28:55,763 --> 00:28:59,559
Anyways, what I'm saying is, people are
killing themselves to get there.

410
00:28:59,642 --> 00:29:02,812
At a certain point, they'll use
the same logic to kill somebody else,

411
00:29:03,062 --> 00:29:05,565
'cause they're just sending them
somewhere else, right?

412
00:29:06,733 --> 00:29:08,276
Finally, he's here.

413
00:29:09,902 --> 00:29:13,656
And he is not wearing
the temp jumpsuit I had left for him.

414
00:29:15,992 --> 00:29:18,995
We're programmed
to process our experiences

415
00:29:19,078 --> 00:29:24,417
as having a beginning and an end,
when, in reality... doesn't exist.

416
00:29:25,626 --> 00:29:28,004
It's just one long, drawn-out middle.

417
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,840
Some of you are newer than others,

418
00:29:30,923 --> 00:29:35,136
but I wanted to create a select group
that could see what it is that I built.

419
00:29:36,012 --> 00:29:39,515
But before we do that,
I'd like to take a moment

420
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,520
and have you join me
in... bowing our heads...

421
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:55,198
And let your subconscious...
take you somewhere else.

422
00:30:00,495 --> 00:30:04,123
I'm sort of amazed that you get
swept up in this, this easily.

423
00:30:04,207 --> 00:30:07,627
You don't strike me
as a say-your-prayers type.

424
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:11,339
Just because somebody doesn't believe
in God doesn't mean they can't pray.

425
00:30:11,422 --> 00:30:13,508
What kind of an atheist talks to God?

426
00:30:13,591 --> 00:30:16,010
[opera music playing over speakers]

427
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:22,433
Why did you give me
a phony, bullshit last name?

428
00:30:24,227 --> 00:30:27,355
It wasn't phony.
It was my mother's maiden name.

429
00:30:27,939 --> 00:30:29,107
Where is she?

430
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:31,526
She's dead.

431
00:30:33,778 --> 00:30:35,238
How did she die?

432
00:30:37,949 --> 00:30:39,075
Because of my dad.

433
00:30:42,203 --> 00:30:44,330
Let us come back into this moment.

434
00:30:52,964 --> 00:30:55,466
I now offer you the opportunity...

435
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,387
to see the afterlife.

436
00:31:02,557 --> 00:31:04,434
I can now record where we go.

437
00:31:20,241 --> 00:31:23,661
[Cooper] Please, uh...
get these back to us

438
00:31:24,203 --> 00:31:25,913
at your earliest convenience.

439
00:31:26,747 --> 00:31:30,501
And again, these living quarters
are just temporary

440
00:31:30,585 --> 00:31:33,296
until we can find you
a more suitable room.

441
00:31:34,672 --> 00:31:38,551
When I first moved here,
I slept on a cot in the kitchen.

442
00:31:39,218 --> 00:31:41,262
-Glamorous.
-[chuckles]

443
00:31:41,554 --> 00:31:44,557
I'm supposed to be at the bottom
of the ocean, so this should be fine.

444
00:31:45,224 --> 00:31:46,058
Can I have a pen?

445
00:31:49,896 --> 00:31:51,105
Nondisclosure agreement.

446
00:31:51,189 --> 00:31:55,860
Well, considering the sensitivity,
it's a fairly standard document.

447
00:31:55,943 --> 00:31:58,070
Could we have the room for a second,
please?

448
00:32:01,866 --> 00:32:06,454
[Cooper] You remember that awful week
when we slept on the cot by the fridge?

449
00:32:06,537 --> 00:32:08,080
My back sure hasn't forgotten.

450
00:32:08,164 --> 00:32:09,999
-[Will] Hey.
-Mm.

451
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:15,505
So... I know that
that device is very compelling. Um...

452
00:32:15,588 --> 00:32:18,549
-Can we talk about it for a second?
-I'm not allowed to talk about it,

453
00:32:18,633 --> 00:32:20,801
'cause I just signed
a nondisclosure agreement.

454
00:32:21,594 --> 00:32:22,929
[snickers]

455
00:32:23,012 --> 00:32:24,096
[sighs]

456
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,767
So, your dad's a little weird.
Who cares? It doesn't make him wrong.

457
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:31,896
I mean, Poe fucked his cousin.
It didn't make him any less a writer.

458
00:32:32,396 --> 00:32:34,649
I wanna see if that machine does
what he thinks it does.

459
00:32:35,191 --> 00:32:36,234
Well, what if it did?

460
00:32:37,652 --> 00:32:38,986
How would that change things?

461
00:32:39,946 --> 00:32:42,823
You don't go on vacation
without looking at the brochure first.

462
00:32:50,248 --> 00:32:53,209
Hey. Uh... I'm sorry. Were you sleeping?

463
00:32:54,585 --> 00:32:55,628
I'm standing.

464
00:32:56,587 --> 00:32:57,922
Well, yeah.

465
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:01,592
That's just something
you're supposed to say, I guess.

466
00:33:02,552 --> 00:33:03,553
Um...

467
00:33:03,636 --> 00:33:07,348
Since you're up, mind coming downstairs
and taking a look at something for me?

468
00:33:07,848 --> 00:33:08,808
Yeah, sure.

469
00:33:11,018 --> 00:33:12,311
[sighs]

470
00:33:12,395 --> 00:33:16,315
[woman on recording] <i>Those that</i>
<i>we have lost are not lost at all...</i>

471
00:33:16,816 --> 00:33:19,569
-[Isla] Where are you guys going?
-It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

472
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:22,363
<i>...then it's us who are lost.</i>

473
00:33:22,446 --> 00:33:28,411
When he flatlines, think of it
as a light bulb turned off by a switch.

474
00:33:28,494 --> 00:33:30,162
Flip it on, flip it off.

475
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:34,208
But going under,
hooked up to the new device,

476
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:36,544
you're not just flipping a light switch.

477
00:33:36,627 --> 00:33:40,381
You're essentially detaching
the entire bulb.

478
00:33:40,464 --> 00:33:42,883
So, I'd say that if you go under again...

479
00:33:43,426 --> 00:33:46,095
you're coming back
with next to no brain functionality.

480
00:33:46,178 --> 00:33:48,431
I'm sort of surprised
it hasn't happened already.

481
00:33:50,933 --> 00:33:54,437
I know you wanted to be first, but if you
don't come back, what's the point?

482
00:33:55,021 --> 00:33:57,898
We just go back
to the drawing board. Right?

483
00:33:58,816 --> 00:34:02,903
I mean, it could still work,
we just need to find a new way to...

484
00:34:02,987 --> 00:34:04,113
We need a cadaver.

485
00:34:06,115 --> 00:34:08,159
Okay. Uh, I'm sorry to interrupt.

486
00:34:09,035 --> 00:34:10,995
Where do you guys plan
on getting a corpse?

487
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,708
I have a corpse idea.

488
00:34:30,806 --> 00:34:32,808
[rock music playing over earbuds]

489
00:34:34,143 --> 00:34:35,686
-Am I being rude?
-Huh?

490
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:37,438
-Am I being rude?
-No.

491
00:34:39,482 --> 00:34:42,818
-Care to... listen?
-Sure.

492
00:34:44,528 --> 00:34:48,324
Crunchy groovy grooves.
Serene nights.

493
00:34:57,792 --> 00:34:59,460
-Can I ask you something?
-Mm-hmm.

494
00:35:00,044 --> 00:35:03,255
Will mentioned what happened
to your mom earlier.

495
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:04,840
That she killed herself?

496
00:35:07,343 --> 00:35:08,511
Not exactly.

497
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:11,180
So, she was trying to get there?

498
00:35:11,263 --> 00:35:15,226
No, that was a good couple years
before the Discovery.

499
00:35:17,728 --> 00:35:18,729
Huh.

500
00:35:26,904 --> 00:35:28,030
[bell rings]

501
00:35:30,825 --> 00:35:31,701
Yeah.

502
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,704
[door buzzes]

503
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,294
How you doing?

504
00:35:42,837 --> 00:35:47,007
In the midst of life, I am in death.

505
00:35:48,426 --> 00:35:52,471
That was weird. I was just wondering
if you could help me out.

506
00:35:52,555 --> 00:35:55,182
My, uh, cousin, Billy...

507
00:35:56,809 --> 00:35:58,102
he's gone missing.

508
00:35:58,185 --> 00:36:01,439
And it being the two-year anniversary
of the Discovery,

509
00:36:01,522 --> 00:36:04,191
we're all just a little worried.

510
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,569
Really worried.

511
00:36:07,153 --> 00:36:10,239
We got three John Does in this week.
How long has he been missing?

512
00:36:11,532 --> 00:36:14,702
Nope. No. No Billy here.

513
00:36:15,745 --> 00:36:16,620
Bummer.

514
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:19,248
Would have made my life
a hell of a lot easier.

515
00:36:20,374 --> 00:36:22,209
Sorry, that was insensitive.

516
00:36:22,793 --> 00:36:26,130
They just got me running rampant here.
I'm doing the job of five people.

517
00:36:27,465 --> 00:36:30,468
Off-season cutbacks and whatnot? Yeah.

518
00:36:32,344 --> 00:36:35,097
Can I give you a description... of Billy?

519
00:36:35,181 --> 00:36:39,977
That way if he does... come in,
you can keep an eye out for him.

520
00:36:40,644 --> 00:36:41,896
Of course.

521
00:36:42,813 --> 00:36:43,898
Let's go to my office.

522
00:36:51,155 --> 00:36:53,699
[Toby] Hey, so, just curious...

523
00:37:09,882 --> 00:37:10,716
[chuckles]

524
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,470
I'd like to point out you're reading off
a laundry list of corpse requirements.

525
00:37:15,054 --> 00:37:16,555
Aneurysm, that won't work.

526
00:37:19,892 --> 00:37:23,729
It'd be nice if you could help me,
seeing as we're breaking and entering.

527
00:37:23,813 --> 00:37:27,149
Like a real, like, pouty-type face.

528
00:37:29,235 --> 00:37:30,611
And then, um...

529
00:37:32,238 --> 00:37:36,033
he's got a birthmark on, uh...

530
00:37:37,701 --> 00:37:42,081
Let's see. On his right elbow.
You're not writing any of this down.

531
00:37:42,164 --> 00:37:45,668
Well, I think I've got more
than I need to go on here, so...

532
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:49,797
But we... We haven't even gotten
to the lower half of his body.

533
00:37:50,673 --> 00:37:53,843
Don't you think it's weird how
these people were alive a few hours ago?

534
00:37:53,926 --> 00:37:58,264
They had fears and desires,
they could exercise?

535
00:37:58,347 --> 00:38:01,809
I don't think it's weird.
I think it's fucking sad.

536
00:38:02,977 --> 00:38:05,980
-Maybe they went someplace better.
-Maybe they went someplace worse.

537
00:38:06,063 --> 00:38:08,816
Maybe they went someplace
that we can't even begin to comprehend.

538
00:38:09,275 --> 00:38:12,403
All the more reason to see
what your dad's machine shows us.

539
00:38:14,029 --> 00:38:14,864
Shit.

540
00:38:17,783 --> 00:38:18,617
What?

541
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,663
"Fifty-two, massive coronary."

542
00:38:26,709 --> 00:38:27,543
Will...

543
00:38:30,754 --> 00:38:32,214
meet Pat Phillips.

544
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,636
Pat Phillips, this is Will.

545
00:38:51,317 --> 00:38:53,527
I don't like that creepy room
Cooper put me in.

546
00:38:53,611 --> 00:38:55,404
I'm gonna sleep in your room tonight.

547
00:39:02,828 --> 00:39:03,913
Top or bottom?

548
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,133
We could talk, you know.

549
00:39:19,929 --> 00:39:22,348
When I'm nervous,
I talk too much or not at all.

550
00:39:24,016 --> 00:39:25,935
Well, you're safe here.

551
00:39:26,018 --> 00:39:28,979
I mean... nothing leaves the bunk beds.

552
00:39:34,026 --> 00:39:36,278
When I first got here
and they gave me that jumpsuit,

553
00:39:36,362 --> 00:39:39,323
it had a V etched on it.
I wonder what that stood for.

554
00:39:40,991 --> 00:39:41,992
"Visitor," maybe?

555
00:39:42,701 --> 00:39:43,535
Is that a guess?

556
00:39:44,495 --> 00:39:45,871
That was a pretty good guess.

557
00:39:46,872 --> 00:39:48,916
It's like one of those
really obvious answers

558
00:39:48,999 --> 00:39:52,086
that only seems obvious
after you find out about it.

559
00:39:52,795 --> 00:39:55,089
Were you really smart growing up?
I bet you were.

560
00:39:56,256 --> 00:40:00,219
I was told that I demonstrated an early
ability to recognize spatial patterns,

561
00:40:00,302 --> 00:40:01,512
whatever that means.

562
00:40:02,054 --> 00:40:05,140
I always took it as one of those things
a teacher tells to a parent

563
00:40:05,224 --> 00:40:07,601
to make them feel better
about their shitty kid.

564
00:40:08,352 --> 00:40:10,562
Like, "Gordon is very good
at drawing circles.

565
00:40:10,646 --> 00:40:14,274
Gordon draws circles at a more
advanced level than the other children."

566
00:40:16,068 --> 00:40:18,112
These bunk beds really worked out well,

567
00:40:18,195 --> 00:40:22,032
'cause they spared me the awkwardness of
having to tell you I'm not gonna fuck you.

568
00:40:23,367 --> 00:40:27,079
Sorry, all I heard was something
about circles and not fucking me.

569
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:32,084
I don't wanna be the only fucked up person
on this bunk bed, Will.

570
00:40:32,167 --> 00:40:35,379
Maybe... tell me about your mom now.

571
00:40:41,218 --> 00:40:43,846
There's not much to tell.
She killed herself.

572
00:40:46,056 --> 00:40:47,307
On their anniversary.

573
00:40:51,729 --> 00:40:52,855
How did she do it?

574
00:40:56,859 --> 00:40:58,110
She made them dinner,

575
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:02,239
and... my dad didn't
even come out of his office.

576
00:41:06,035 --> 00:41:10,497
If he'd even just hinted
that he gave a shit, I mean, who knows?

577
00:41:11,457 --> 00:41:13,876
But he couldn't be bothered.
So, she went upstairs...

578
00:41:15,044 --> 00:41:17,671
took a bath instead and, uh...

579
00:41:19,214 --> 00:41:21,717
Yeah, the next morning
I found her in the tub.

580
00:41:26,263 --> 00:41:27,389
And so, you left?

581
00:41:28,057 --> 00:41:30,851
Yeah, I had to.
I couldn't be around it. I knew.

582
00:41:33,395 --> 00:41:38,692
It's like everything that was recognizable
sort of instantly became unrecognizable.

583
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:48,619
Sometimes I feel like I'm taking
someone else's spot and then I feel sad.

584
00:41:50,788 --> 00:41:51,622
How do you mean?

585
00:41:52,206 --> 00:41:54,708
Like, being here alive is a waste

586
00:41:54,792 --> 00:41:59,379
because... I don't enjoy it,
I'm not happy or grateful...

587
00:42:00,339 --> 00:42:02,341
and I'm taking a spot away
from someone who

588
00:42:02,424 --> 00:42:04,676
maybe would've gotten
something more out of it.

589
00:42:05,552 --> 00:42:06,553
Yeah.

590
00:42:07,471 --> 00:42:09,306
I guess I don't think it works that way.

591
00:42:14,853 --> 00:42:17,189
Here's something I haven't heard
anyone talk about.

592
00:42:17,815 --> 00:42:19,733
Do animals have an afterlife?

593
00:42:20,609 --> 00:42:25,197
Bunnies, kittens, pigs, monkeys.
What happens to them after they die?

594
00:42:26,115 --> 00:42:29,201
I mean, I feel like they really deserve
an afterlife.

595
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:32,496
Do they have their own animal afterlife?

596
00:42:32,788 --> 00:42:35,374
And if they do,
is it subdivided by species?

597
00:42:35,457 --> 00:42:38,168
Because it feels like something
as profound as an afterlife

598
00:42:38,252 --> 00:42:39,837
shouldn't practice segregation.

599
00:42:40,295 --> 00:42:41,296
[Will chuckles]

600
00:42:48,595 --> 00:42:50,305
And what happens to a child?

601
00:42:59,898 --> 00:43:01,859
Hold hands till we fall asleep?

602
00:43:16,874 --> 00:43:20,085
This doesn't seem entirely fair.

603
00:43:20,669 --> 00:43:21,879
Shh.

604
00:43:23,755 --> 00:43:24,798
Yeah, okay.

605
00:43:44,151 --> 00:43:45,777
[speaking indistinctly]

606
00:44:09,051 --> 00:44:10,010
Lacey?

607
00:44:18,352 --> 00:44:19,436
Okay, Toby?

608
00:44:22,314 --> 00:44:24,775
[machine beeps, then whirs]

609
00:44:28,862 --> 00:44:30,155
Did you hit...? Hit it again.

610
00:44:30,906 --> 00:44:33,325
[beeps, then whirs]

611
00:44:35,702 --> 00:44:36,578
Again.

612
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,206
[beeping and whirring continue]

613
00:44:39,873 --> 00:44:40,791
Hit it again.

614
00:44:40,874 --> 00:44:41,959
I'm hitting it.

615
00:44:44,378 --> 00:44:45,295
Hit it again.

616
00:44:45,379 --> 00:44:48,090
-You're gonna fry the body.
-Toby, hit it again.

617
00:44:49,675 --> 00:44:51,009
Again.

618
00:44:52,427 --> 00:44:53,428
Hit it again.

619
00:44:56,848 --> 00:44:58,183
Again. Hit it again.

620
00:45:14,157 --> 00:45:15,158

-Hey.

What are you doing with my body?

633
00:47:48,353 --> 00:47:52,524
Your body, uh, is to be cremated at noon,
so, I'm getting it ready.

634
00:47:53,066 --> 00:47:55,277
We do still have a little time
to prep a redo.

635
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:59,030
Redo? Guys, come on.
You almost fried the body.

636
00:47:59,114 --> 00:48:02,033
You do this redo,
you're gonna cremate him early. All right?

637
00:48:04,578 --> 00:48:06,746
Toby, rustle up a van. Will's right.

638
00:48:16,464 --> 00:48:17,299
It's good.

639
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:21,094
Seeing you back in the labs again,
it's good.

Toby, I want you to locate me
a new corpse, immediately.

644
00:49:11,686 --> 00:49:13,939
Hey. Can I ask you something?

645
00:49:14,022 --> 00:49:16,149
-Okay.
-How'd you end up here?

646
00:49:17,234 --> 00:49:18,109
Why?

647
00:49:22,364 --> 00:49:25,533
I came home and found my dad
and my sister hanging in my living room.

648
00:49:26,826 --> 00:49:27,744
To get there.

649
00:49:29,913 --> 00:49:30,830
I'm sorry.

650
00:49:31,873 --> 00:49:34,793
It's okay. They didn't want me to come.

651
00:49:43,218 --> 00:49:44,844
Can you imagine feeling abandoned

652
00:49:44,928 --> 00:49:47,514
'cause your dad left you out
of the family suicide?

653
00:49:50,058 --> 00:49:51,059
What's wrong with you?

654
00:49:52,269 --> 00:49:53,270
Oh.

655
00:49:53,353 --> 00:49:55,230
Nothing, I'm just... I'm processing.

[groans]

657
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,777
I mean, do you ever get out of your head
even for one minute?

658
00:50:02,862 --> 00:50:04,030
Let's do an experiment.

659
00:50:04,489 --> 00:50:07,659
Look at me and tell me
the first thing that comes to your mind.

660
00:50:07,742 --> 00:50:08,868
I'm driving.

661
00:50:10,954 --> 00:50:11,830
Okay.

662
00:50:13,415 --> 00:50:15,292
I don't know you very well.

663
00:50:16,793 --> 00:50:20,505
I think you're beautiful, and alive,
and if you killed yourself,

664
00:50:20,588 --> 00:50:23,091
it wouldn't just be sad,
it would be a tragedy.

665
00:50:25,844 --> 00:50:26,845
Shut up.

666
00:50:35,937 --> 00:50:37,647
-You want the head or the feet?
-Head.

667
00:50:38,356 --> 00:50:39,524
Okay.

668
00:50:44,195 --> 00:50:46,990
"Oh, hey, Isla. What are you up to?"

669
00:50:48,116 --> 00:50:49,326
"Oh, nothing much, Jim.

670
00:50:50,327 --> 00:50:54,205
I'm just... lugging a corpse
through a parking lot."

671
00:50:55,123 --> 00:50:58,835
-Why'd you go with "Jim"?
-Don't be jealous of hypothetical Jim.

672
00:50:59,419 --> 00:51:02,672
Believe me, if hypothetical Jim
makes you not wanna kill yourself,

673
00:51:03,048 --> 00:51:04,299
I can be supportive.

674
00:51:04,424 --> 00:51:05,675
Do we just leave it here?

675
00:51:06,926 --> 00:51:11,139
Believe it or not, it's my first time
returning a corpse, so... I'm improvising.

676
00:51:15,185 --> 00:51:18,730
Hi, yeah, um, I was just driving by
and this is kind of weird,

677
00:51:18,813 --> 00:51:24,277
but there seems to be, like,
a dead body laying in your parking lot.

678
00:51:25,111 --> 00:51:26,946
-That was pretty good.
-Shut up. Get out.

679
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:30,325
-I'm saying you're doing a good job. Fine.
-Stop it. Sorry. Yeah, no, bad...

680
00:51:30,408 --> 00:51:32,160
Bad reception on the island. Um...

681
00:51:32,243 --> 00:51:35,246
Yeah, the body seems to be abandoned,
and... I don't know.

682
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:38,958
Unless, of course, you guys are playing
some sort of fucked-up scavenger hunt.

683
00:51:42,128 --> 00:51:44,464
Okay. Yes, thank you. Bye.

684
00:51:54,432 --> 00:51:56,101
-How'd that go?
-It went really well.

685
00:51:56,184 --> 00:51:58,853
Okay. You're, like, weirdly good at that.

686
00:52:01,231 --> 00:52:02,273
-Oh.
-Here they are.

687
00:52:03,691 --> 00:52:05,693
-[Isla chuckles]
-They're pretty confused.

What do you think they're thinking?

689
00:52:09,072 --> 00:52:13,535
I don't know, but I think Pat Phillips
has had a really tough few days.

690
00:52:14,828 --> 00:52:16,162
We're both going to hell.

691
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,958
Yeah. Whatever the afterlife is, I guess.

00:52:22,502 --> 00:52:24,421

I have to go get some stuff.

[woman] As far as our records indicate,

703
00:55:16,175 --> 00:55:19,304
we've had 23 patients
with the name Phillips on file.

-How accurate are your records?
-Accurate.

I would love to see that list.

00:55:28,813 --> 00:55:30,690
Mm. I'm sure you would.

707

00:56:30,667 --> 00:56:32,168
Are you looking for something?

Maybe you can help me. Um...

00:56:37,006 --> 00:56:40,176
-Did there used to be a hallway here?
-Used to.

711
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,512
They did a little remodeling.

712
00:56:43,805 --> 00:56:45,848
Took their sweet-ass time with it, too.

713
00:56:47,975 --> 00:56:50,228
I'm sorry, how long ago was that remodel?

714
00:56:51,354 --> 00:56:52,980
About a decade ago.

715
00:57:03,408 --> 00:57:05,410
[electric guitar playing gently]

716
00:57:28,141 --> 00:57:29,142
[Isla] Hey.

717
00:57:30,059 --> 00:57:31,602
-Hey.
-Where have you been?

718
00:57:34,689 --> 00:57:36,691
This is, uh... This is interesting.

719
00:57:45,241 --> 00:57:46,701
Okay, thank you, Toby.

720
00:57:47,577 --> 00:57:48,661
Thank you, my boy.

721
00:57:51,581 --> 00:57:52,999
Well, hello to you all.

722
00:57:54,459 --> 00:57:55,752
As always, it's a pleasure.

723
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,881
When you all first got here, you...

724
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,134
You used this, uh, piece of equipment.

725
00:58:04,385 --> 00:58:05,386
The questionnaire.

726
00:58:06,763 --> 00:58:08,931
And your answers are
what allowed you to stay here,

727
00:58:09,015 --> 00:58:12,143
so, basically... a trust was built.

728
00:58:13,352 --> 00:58:15,563
But lately, I'm beginning to wonder

729
00:58:15,646 --> 00:58:18,441
if perhaps we're getting
just a little too comfortable here.

730
00:58:19,525 --> 00:58:21,235
There's a lot of loose talk going on.

731
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,865
And it makes me think that
we just might be losing a little focus.

732
00:58:29,243 --> 00:58:30,620
Lacey, would you join me, please?

733
00:58:39,587 --> 00:58:41,714
-What's going on?
-It's okay. Relax.

734
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:44,967
Would you like to tell us
how long you've been here?

735
00:58:47,095 --> 00:58:49,972
Um... just over a year.

736
00:58:50,056 --> 00:58:52,141
Just over a year.
You were one of the first.

737
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,103
How have you been treated?
Have you been treated well?

738
00:58:55,186 --> 00:58:58,022
-Have I been good to you?
-You've been wonderful.

739
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:01,651
-Why are you talking to me like this?
-I've been wonderful.

740
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:06,447
If I've been wonderful, then why are you
telling your peers about the device,

741
00:59:06,531 --> 00:59:09,992
and particularly...
why are you saying it failed?

742
00:59:13,121 --> 00:59:13,955
Speak up.

743
00:59:16,582 --> 00:59:17,583
Um...

744
00:59:20,336 --> 00:59:21,212
It's okay.

745
00:59:22,547 --> 00:59:24,173
I just told one person.

746
00:59:25,842 --> 00:59:28,970
It slipped out when I had mentioned
how the new girl was invited.

747
00:59:30,346 --> 00:59:31,264
[Harber] You mean Isla.

748
00:59:32,598 --> 00:59:35,226
You were displeased
when I invited her here, weren't you?

749
00:59:35,935 --> 00:59:39,605
It's just that some people who have been
here much longer weren't asked.

750
00:59:40,731 --> 00:59:42,567
Tell everyone where I found you.

751
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,611
Thomas.

752
00:59:46,112 --> 00:59:47,029
It's okay.

753
00:59:47,947 --> 00:59:49,282
This is a safe place.

754
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:57,331
In the woods.

755
01:00:00,793 --> 01:00:01,627
Go on.

756
01:00:07,758 --> 01:00:09,010
I had a gun.

757
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,597
And where was that gun aimed?

758
01:00:16,225 --> 01:00:17,476
At my chest.

759
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:20,438
Right next to your heart.

760
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:25,568
Usually, it's the head...
or the barrel goes into the mouth.

761
01:00:25,651 --> 01:00:28,654
I don't know that I've ever seen it
done that way before.

762
01:00:30,948 --> 01:00:31,949
I'm sorry.

763
01:00:35,244 --> 01:00:37,038
Please don't lose faith in me.

764
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,040
"Faith."

765
01:00:40,333 --> 01:00:43,419
Oh, God.
I have such contempt for that word.

766
01:00:43,502 --> 01:00:45,421
Show me someone who relies on faith

767
01:00:45,504 --> 01:00:47,548
and I'll show you someone
who's given up control

768
01:00:47,632 --> 01:00:49,008
over whatever it is they believe.

769
01:00:49,091 --> 01:00:51,135
Sorry, there's nothing more
I can do for you.

770
01:00:51,219 --> 01:00:52,345
Thomas, please.

771
01:00:52,428 --> 01:00:54,972
Pack up your belongings.
Say your goodbyes.

772
01:01:19,497 --> 01:01:21,165
That was a hell of a show out there.

773
01:01:23,251 --> 01:01:24,377
Come on, Will.

774
01:01:25,503 --> 01:01:27,755
You think I don't know a lot
of this is bullshit?

775
01:01:27,838 --> 01:01:31,342
You give meaning to people who think
they have no more reason to live.

776
01:01:31,425 --> 01:01:34,595
The jumpsuit, the chain of command,
the theatrics.

777
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:38,349
It gives them purpose.
And I care about them.

778
01:01:38,432 --> 01:01:41,018
Yeah. Someone should tell that to Lacey.

779
01:01:44,814 --> 01:01:47,650
You... You can pretend all you want

780
01:01:47,733 --> 01:01:50,861
that the reason you left was
because you stopped approving of my work.

781
01:01:50,945 --> 01:01:53,155
Work, by the way, that we did together.

782
01:01:53,864 --> 01:01:57,368
But I think we both know this was never
about the Discovery for you.

783
01:01:57,451 --> 01:02:00,746
-It was always about your mother.
-Yes, of course it was about Mom for me.

784
01:02:07,753 --> 01:02:10,923
Just because you wanna pretend
like Mom did not happen...

785
01:02:11,924 --> 01:02:13,509
doesn't mean that I'm going to.

786
01:02:19,348 --> 01:02:20,474
[door closes]

787
01:02:26,605 --> 01:02:28,607
[indistinct chatter]

788
01:02:30,401 --> 01:02:32,194
-Hey. Can I show you something?
-What?

789
01:02:32,278 --> 01:02:34,822
-Just come with me. Please.
-Sorry.

790
01:02:39,994 --> 01:02:40,995
[Isla] Wait.

791
01:02:41,579 --> 01:02:44,040
-What is this?
-That's what I'm trying to figure out.

792
01:02:46,292 --> 01:02:49,628
-You were gonna keep this from me?
-No, I'm... I'm showing you now.

793
01:02:50,838 --> 01:02:52,631
And I was afraid of what you might do.

794
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:00,139
All right, so, the afterlife...
This is the afterlife?

795
01:03:00,222 --> 01:03:04,352
How can it be the afterlife if we're
in the same parking lot in that recording?

796
01:03:04,435 --> 01:03:05,353
Then what is it?

797
01:03:05,436 --> 01:03:09,148
My theory is that my father invented
something that records memory.

798
01:03:09,857 --> 01:03:12,485
You've heard him go on and on
about the subconscious.

799
01:03:13,402 --> 01:03:16,614
I understand that you wanted this
to be something different.

800
01:03:17,823 --> 01:03:21,035
The proof is overwhelming
that that's a Pat Phillips memory.

801
01:03:22,703 --> 01:03:25,331
Proof shouldn't be overwhelming.
It should be definitive.

802
01:03:28,584 --> 01:03:29,585
[beeps]

803
01:03:37,885 --> 01:03:39,178
Where the fuck are we going?

804
01:03:40,346 --> 01:03:42,723
[Will] <i>If what we're seeing</i>
<i>on that video happened in real life,</i>

805
01:03:42,807 --> 01:03:44,350
<i>I'm gonna find out exactly when.</i>

806
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:48,270
<i>Since this hospital opened, there have</i>
<i>been 23 patients named Phillips.</i>

807
01:03:49,188 --> 01:03:50,606
But based on the model of his truck,

808
01:03:50,689 --> 01:03:54,235
I can eliminate any Phillips
from before the year 2000.

809
01:03:54,527 --> 01:03:57,363
Yeah, but even after 2000,
doesn't that leave a lot of names?

810
01:03:57,446 --> 01:03:59,156
That hospital room doesn't exist anymore,

811
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:03,160
so, we can also cross off
any Phillips from the past decade.

812
01:04:08,582 --> 01:04:10,084
That leaves us with one.

813
01:04:17,967 --> 01:04:19,093
"Connor Phillips"?

814
01:04:20,052 --> 01:04:21,011
That's him.

815
01:04:22,263 --> 01:04:23,764
That's Pat Phillips' dad.

816
01:04:25,349 --> 01:04:27,226
He died here 13 years ago.

817
01:04:31,397 --> 01:04:33,357
So, it does just record a memory?

818
01:04:37,945 --> 01:04:41,365
[Will] It's pretty fucked up
what happened today, huh? With Lacey?

819
01:04:41,449 --> 01:04:43,117
She spoke out of turn.

820
01:04:44,493 --> 01:04:47,788
And she knew the rules.
She basically helped write them.

821
01:04:47,872 --> 01:04:49,623
It's just you and me talking.

822
01:04:50,624 --> 01:04:52,042
You don't believe that.

823
01:04:52,626 --> 01:04:54,587
Stop telling me what I believe, Will.

824
01:04:58,424 --> 01:05:02,261
Proving the existence of an afterlife
destroyed Dad's own life.

825
01:05:02,344 --> 01:05:04,096
That's what I believe.

826
01:05:05,014 --> 01:05:07,433
Yeah... everybody else's, too.

827
01:05:07,683 --> 01:05:09,351
Dad has no intention...

828
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:12,730
of showing anything the machine records
with the outside world.

829
01:05:12,813 --> 01:05:17,526
That's why he lost it
when Lacey told people.

830
01:05:18,235 --> 01:05:20,905
If he has no intention
of showing what it does to anybody,

831
01:05:20,988 --> 01:05:23,991
why is he doing it, huh? What's the point?

832
01:05:24,617 --> 01:05:25,868
"Why is he doing it?"

833
01:05:27,745 --> 01:05:28,787
[chuckles]

834
01:05:28,871 --> 01:05:30,122
"Why is he doing it?"

835
01:05:31,165 --> 01:05:32,082
Let's see.

836
01:05:34,877 --> 01:05:35,878
Well...

837
01:05:37,922 --> 01:05:40,841
he'll tell you
about the millions of people who died,

838
01:05:40,925 --> 01:05:43,594
and he'll tell you about
finishing his work to honor them.

839
01:05:45,137 --> 01:05:46,764
I heard that yesterday.

840
01:05:46,847 --> 01:05:49,433
I've been hearing that
for the past two years now.

841
01:05:51,936 --> 01:05:53,062
[Toby chuckles]

842
01:05:53,145 --> 01:05:57,441
And I just... smile and nod and agree...

843
01:05:59,568 --> 01:06:02,321
like the idiot son,
but I do understand things.

844
01:06:05,658 --> 01:06:07,535
I know Mom died...

845
01:06:08,452 --> 01:06:10,663
Not died. She killed herself.

846
01:06:12,456 --> 01:06:14,500
She killed herself.

847
01:06:16,418 --> 01:06:18,546
And when you look...

848
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:22,925
at what Dad spent his life working on,

849
01:06:23,259 --> 01:06:29,098
and when you look at the way
Mom killed herself, how she did it...

850
01:06:31,308 --> 01:06:37,648
how would Dad not feel a little anger
on top of his guilt?

851
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:41,151
Hmm?

852
01:06:43,153 --> 01:06:46,240
Dad does need... to know.

853
01:06:47,992 --> 01:06:50,327
He needs to know
that she made it somewhere.

854
01:06:54,915 --> 01:06:56,542
He overreacted, that's all.

855
01:06:58,043 --> 01:07:02,965
He'll come to his senses,
and, uh, Lacey will be back by tomorrow.

856
01:07:08,512 --> 01:07:10,389
Dad always comes to his senses.

857
01:07:21,483 --> 01:07:22,610
It's not a memory, Will.

858
01:07:24,028 --> 01:07:24,862
What?

859
01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:28,991
[Isla] On his left arm in that exact spot,
there was a different tattoo.

860
01:07:29,074 --> 01:07:31,785
-[Will] How is that possible?
-I don't know, but in the lab, I saw it.

861
01:07:31,869 --> 01:07:34,038
It wasn't a lighthouse.
It was waves on his arm.

862
01:07:34,788 --> 01:07:36,165
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

863
01:07:36,415 --> 01:07:38,500
It's not a memory.
This is something else.

864
01:07:39,627 --> 01:07:41,420
If it's not a memory, then what is it?

865
01:07:44,673 --> 01:07:46,675
Everything we've seen
doesn't exist anymore.

866
01:07:46,759 --> 01:07:50,554
I mean, the hospital room's gone,
Pat Phillips, obviously gone.

867
01:07:52,306 --> 01:07:55,225
We need to find something in this video
that still exists.

868
01:07:57,770 --> 01:08:00,439
The... The woman. There's a...

869
01:08:03,651 --> 01:08:04,526
Her.

870
01:08:06,278 --> 01:08:08,947
We have Connor Phillips' address
on his death certificate.

871
01:08:09,031 --> 01:08:12,076
So, I say that we go
down there tomorrow...

872
01:08:13,118 --> 01:08:15,621
and we see if somebody
can help us track her down.

873
01:08:30,094 --> 01:08:31,804
Will, why are we back here?

874
01:08:32,096 --> 01:08:35,140
I don't know what's waiting for us
at that house, and I...

875
01:08:38,519 --> 01:08:42,147
Do you remember I told you
about my accident when I was a kid?

876
01:08:42,606 --> 01:08:45,359
Yeah, when you lied to your mom
about what you saw.

877
01:08:45,442 --> 01:08:46,276
I didn't lie.

878
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:49,071
I didn't lie.

879
01:08:50,906 --> 01:08:51,907
[sighs]

880
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:54,535
This is where I saw whatever...

881
01:08:55,577 --> 01:08:57,913
Whatever it is that I saw.
This is the beach.

882
01:09:01,458 --> 01:09:06,046
I used to come here when I was a kid,
like... I was drawn to it.

883
01:09:07,673 --> 01:09:09,425
Or it made me feel better.

884
01:09:11,593 --> 01:09:13,220
Anyway... Um...

885
01:09:14,179 --> 01:09:19,059
when I saw you walking into the water
the other day, that's...

886
01:09:19,143 --> 01:09:20,519
That's why I was here.

887
01:09:25,941 --> 01:09:26,984
What?

888
01:10:06,064 --> 01:10:07,024
I had a son...

889
01:10:12,070 --> 01:10:13,572
and he was five years old.

890
01:10:17,534 --> 01:10:18,786
And I fell asleep...

891
01:10:21,288 --> 01:10:23,123
just for a second.

892
01:10:26,376 --> 01:10:28,587
And when I woke up, he was gone.

893
01:11:04,665 --> 01:11:09,211
At first I thought I wasn't supposed
to meet you... or feel anything.

894
01:11:13,465 --> 01:11:14,883
But maybe I was wrong.

895
01:11:34,361 --> 01:11:35,779
[Will sighs]

896
01:11:48,709 --> 01:11:51,670
Um, hi. Is this the Phillips residence?

897
01:11:52,671 --> 01:11:54,798
Connor... Did you know Connor Phillips?

898
01:11:55,382 --> 01:11:57,843
Pat Phillips? Can you speak English?

899
01:12:00,804 --> 01:12:01,930
Okay.

900
01:12:02,014 --> 01:12:04,600
Okay, well, that's clearly not the woman
from the video.

901
01:12:06,476 --> 01:12:08,020
Maybe they moved or something.

902
01:12:08,228 --> 01:12:10,188
Should we see
if they have the new address?

903
01:12:10,272 --> 01:12:12,399
I don't know. I don't know.

904
01:12:15,611 --> 01:12:16,612
Can I help you?

905
01:12:21,575 --> 01:12:23,201
I haven't seen my brother in years.

906
01:12:23,869 --> 01:12:25,829
I'd call it more of a loss for her
than for me.

907
01:12:28,123 --> 01:12:29,166
Alzheimer's.

908
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:31,877
She deteriorated after Dad died.

909
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:33,712
-Connor?
-You knew my father, too?

910
01:12:33,795 --> 01:12:38,800
You know, actually, Pat mentioned him.
That he went to see him before he died.

911
01:12:39,384 --> 01:12:41,219
Well, anyway, Dad died and...

912
01:12:42,137 --> 01:12:45,474
Mom, she started going downhill
real fast after that.

913
01:12:46,433 --> 01:12:48,810
My husband and I, we own the house now.

914
01:12:49,436 --> 01:12:52,439
Is there gonna be a service or anything,
um, for Pat?

915
01:12:53,023 --> 01:12:53,857
I wouldn't know.

916
01:12:55,525 --> 01:12:57,486
I'm sorry, if you don't mind me saying,

917
01:12:57,569 --> 01:13:00,405
you don't seem that upset
about your brother's death.

918
01:13:01,448 --> 01:13:02,616
[sighing] Look...

919
01:13:03,367 --> 01:13:06,244
it seems as though you liked him.
You found something in him...

920
01:13:07,162 --> 01:13:08,330
so, I'm sorry.

921
01:13:09,706 --> 01:13:13,293
But to the rest of us...
he was a piece of shit

922
01:13:13,377 --> 01:13:16,254
who left his sister
with a cancer-ridden father

923
01:13:16,338 --> 01:13:19,341
and a mother
who lost every marble she ever had.

924
01:13:21,259 --> 01:13:25,138
I'm sorry. So... [clears throat]
is the last time that you saw Pat

925
01:13:25,222 --> 01:13:27,391
when he went to visit
your Dad in the hospital?

926
01:13:27,474 --> 01:13:30,560
I don't know what bullshit
he hauled your way,

927
01:13:30,644 --> 01:13:33,230
but he never visited my father
in the hospital.

928
01:13:33,313 --> 01:13:34,982
If he told you that, it's a lie.

929
01:13:36,942 --> 01:13:40,487
He called and said he was gonna visit him,
but he never showed up.

930
01:13:41,571 --> 01:13:44,866
This is gonna sound really strange,
but did Pat have a tattoo?

931
01:13:45,409 --> 01:13:46,535
He told you about that?

932
01:13:48,245 --> 01:13:49,121
Well...

933
01:13:53,458 --> 01:13:56,837
When he turned 18,
we got matching waves.

934
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:00,215
We were really close then.

935
01:14:09,891 --> 01:14:13,186
So, the machine doesn't record a memory.
It wasn't a bad theory.

936
01:14:15,856 --> 01:14:17,816
People are just gonna
keep killing themselves.

937
01:14:18,358 --> 01:14:21,653
You know, sooner or later,
you're gonna have to forgive your dad.

938
01:14:22,946 --> 01:14:26,283
I've been thinking a lot
about the difference between...

939
01:14:27,409 --> 01:14:29,661
what something is
and what something means.

940
01:14:31,204 --> 01:14:33,040
And I don't know what any of this is...

941
01:14:34,791 --> 01:14:37,252
but I do think
if there's a meaning to any of it,

942
01:14:37,335 --> 01:14:40,380
it has something to do
with not pressing the reset button,

943
01:14:40,464 --> 01:14:42,424
even if things get really rough.

944
01:14:56,229 --> 01:15:00,776
We're a bunch of people running around,
making the same mistakes over and over.

945
01:15:01,818 --> 01:15:04,988
And I don't know why we think
it'll be different somewhere else...

946
01:15:06,490 --> 01:15:09,076
unless we learn what we're supposed to
while we're here.

947
01:15:20,253 --> 01:15:21,254
[Isla sighs]

948
01:15:29,221 --> 01:15:30,722
What was your son's name?

949
01:15:33,725 --> 01:15:34,559
Oliver.

950
01:15:39,898 --> 01:15:41,024
I was dreaming.

951
01:15:43,401 --> 01:15:45,237
When he was in the water,
I was dreaming.

952
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,240
What about?

953
01:15:50,575 --> 01:15:51,409
I don't know.

954
01:15:53,245 --> 01:15:54,287
I can't remember.

955
01:15:56,790 --> 01:16:00,752
It was one of those times where you know
for sure you're dreaming, but you don't...

956
01:16:01,878 --> 01:16:03,004
don't know what about.

957
01:16:07,092 --> 01:16:08,093
I wish I knew.

958
01:16:16,810 --> 01:16:20,397
You don't have to do this alone anymore
if you don't want to.

959
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:04,274
[Toby] Will!

960
01:17:06,318 --> 01:17:07,736
Fuck! Fuck, Will!

961
01:17:09,112 --> 01:17:11,448
Get up. It's Dad.
What the fuck are you doing?

962
01:17:11,948 --> 01:17:12,949
What about Dad?

963
01:17:13,033 --> 01:17:15,660
-It's dad. Get the fuck up.
-Okay. All right. I'm coming.

964
01:17:17,996 --> 01:17:20,457
I didn't know, so, I couldn't stop it.

965
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:22,584
Slow down
and tell me exactly what happened.

966
01:17:22,667 --> 01:17:26,546
He hooked himself up to the device.
He wanted to prove that it works.

967
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:28,131
-Dad's hooked up right now?
-Yes.

968
01:17:28,215 --> 01:17:30,217
[Isla] We need to tell him that it works.

969
01:17:30,675 --> 01:17:31,551
What?

970
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:33,553
What works?

971
01:17:34,971 --> 01:17:36,514
-What are you doing?
-He demanded.

972
01:17:36,598 --> 01:17:39,434
-Why aren't you bringing him back?
-He's too far along.

973
01:17:39,517 --> 01:17:41,269
We already know that it records something.

974
01:17:41,353 --> 01:17:42,270
Cooper...

975
01:17:42,854 --> 01:17:44,147
it works, okay?

976
01:17:46,107 --> 01:17:46,942
Dad?

977
01:17:47,817 --> 01:17:48,652
Dad?

978
01:17:48,735 --> 01:17:50,445
[woman] <i>Time to pull yourself away.</i>

979
01:17:53,490 --> 01:17:55,408
<i>Come back to reality. Come home.</i>

980
01:17:57,619 --> 01:17:59,746
-Is that Mom?
-It's Mom.

981
01:18:00,789 --> 01:18:02,415
[Harber] <i>What I'm doing is reality.</i>

982
01:18:05,043 --> 01:18:07,504
<i>I need to finish.</i>
<i>It's important. Do you understand?</i>

983
01:18:08,546 --> 01:18:10,548
-Their anniversary.
-Yeah.

984

985
01:18:19,349 --> 01:18:23,353
[Harber] <i>Now, don't be dramatic.</i>
<i>I'll be done soon. And we can have dinner.</i>

986
01:18:41,496 --> 01:18:42,414
[Harber] <i>Honey, wait.</i>

987
01:18:46,751 --> 01:18:50,463
<i>Maybe work can wait.</i>
<i>So, what do you say we have some dinner?</i>

988
01:19:03,059 --> 01:19:04,269
She's not taking the bath.

989
01:19:04,352 --> 01:19:05,687
-That's not what happened.
-I know.

990
01:19:07,022 --> 01:19:08,273
We can bring him back.

991
01:19:08,356 --> 01:19:11,109
Cooper, just... wait.
We have to see what happens.

992
01:19:11,192 --> 01:19:13,778
[Cooper] We've got to do it now,
or it'll be too late.

993
01:19:14,321 --> 01:19:16,156
Will, come on.

994
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,328
Toby, I'm sorry. Cooper, now!

995
01:19:22,954 --> 01:19:25,290
-Dad? Dad, listen to me.
-[defibrillator shocks]

996
01:19:25,373 --> 01:19:27,625
Dad, please. Listen to my voice.

997
01:19:27,709 --> 01:19:30,211
-Is he gonna be brain...?
-I don't know. I don't know.

998
01:19:30,295 --> 01:19:31,296
Cooper, hit it again!

999
01:19:31,629 --> 01:19:32,630
[defibrillator shocks]

1000
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,591
Dad?

1001
01:19:34,674 --> 01:19:36,676
[machine beeping]

1002
01:19:39,429 --> 01:19:40,263
What happened?

1003
01:19:54,569 --> 01:19:55,653
I knew I saw her.

1004
01:19:58,156 --> 01:20:00,950
Like a dream that you can't remember.

1005
01:20:02,702 --> 01:20:04,412
I can't figure out what this is, Dad.

1006
01:20:05,413 --> 01:20:08,416
I never left my study.
Never stopped her on the stairs.

1007
01:20:11,127 --> 01:20:14,005
-And she drew a bath.
-[Will] I know.

1008
01:20:14,589 --> 01:20:17,759
And in the Pat Phillips recording,
he has a different tattoo on his arm.

1009
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:21,721
[Harber] I always said the afterlife
was a different plane of existence.

1010
01:20:23,223 --> 01:20:24,391
But...

1011
01:20:26,476 --> 01:20:30,397
what if it's a different plane...
of this existence?

1012
01:20:32,941 --> 01:20:34,317
Alternate realities?

1013
01:20:34,776 --> 01:20:38,655
No, our reality...
with differences and variations.

1014
01:20:39,697 --> 01:20:43,660
Stepping out of a truck...
to visit a dying parent.

1015
01:20:44,786 --> 01:20:47,664
<i>Random, like different tattoos.</i>

1016
01:20:49,082 --> 01:20:52,544
Stopping someone from going upstairs
to end their life.

1017
01:20:57,757 --> 01:21:02,470
When we die, what if we travel
to an alternate version of our own life?

1018
01:21:03,054 --> 01:21:04,097
A second chance?

1019
01:21:05,515 --> 01:21:09,436
Then we wouldn't... just have to accept
our biggest regret.

1020
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:12,730
In the afterlife, we could change it.

1021
01:21:15,442 --> 01:21:19,737
At the risk of stating
the super fucking obvious...

1022
01:21:20,947 --> 01:21:23,950
if you are right
and word of this got out--

1023
01:21:24,033 --> 01:21:25,493
We have to destroy the machine.

1024
01:21:38,590 --> 01:21:39,591
[Cooper] Hey, Thomas.

1025
01:21:40,967 --> 01:21:43,178
Everyone wants to know what's going on.

1026
01:21:47,515 --> 01:21:50,727
Welcome, everybody.
Nice to have you all here.

1027
01:21:51,895 --> 01:21:56,608
I asked you to gather here today because
I thought that we should be honest.

1028
01:21:56,691 --> 01:21:58,651
-Hi.
-Honest with ourselves,

1029
01:21:58,735 --> 01:22:00,111
honest with each other.

1030
01:22:00,195 --> 01:22:02,071
-You got to see your mom again.
-[Harber] I see you as family...

1031
01:22:02,155 --> 01:22:04,115
and I think you see me
in the same way.

1032
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,367
And as family...

1033
01:22:07,869 --> 01:22:10,079
I think sometimes
we get so absorbed with...

1034
01:22:10,622 --> 01:22:14,209
what we're doing individually,
we go off on our own track and so forth,

1035
01:22:14,292 --> 01:22:17,212
we lose the fact
that how important family is.

Lacey, it's okay. Put the...
Put the gun down.

1040
01:22:30,850 --> 01:22:33,811
Lacey, I was wrong.
You do not need to do this.

1041
01:22:34,395 --> 01:22:35,605
I didn't kill her.

1042
01:22:39,192 --> 01:22:41,152
I just relocated her.

Isla. Oh, it's okay.

Okay. Okay.

[Will] Isla. Dad, please help her.

1052

Don't talk. Just breathe.

1053
01:23:10,306 --> 01:23:11,516
I don't wanna die anymore.

Okay. Yeah, that's probably a good idea.

-No, no, no. Don't.

He needs rest.

He needs to process, okay?

-All right.
-You can check on him after dinner.

to figuring this all out yet,
or what it all means.

1074
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:31,698
Like, if it really is another version
of our own life,

1075
