1
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,322
<i>It's over.</i>

2
00:01:24,831 --> 00:01:27,534
<i>I will always speak to you...</i>

3
00:01:28,082 --> 00:01:31,164
<i>...and I don't mind if
you don't say anything.</i>

4
00:01:35,376 --> 00:01:40,248
<i>Just beacuse you went away, it doesn't
mean you're not here anymore.</i>

5
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:46,583
<i>Perhaps all I ever needed
was this gift.</i>

6
00:01:50,214 --> 00:01:53,747
<i>The one you gave to me at the end.</i>

7
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,617
<i>WOMB</i>

8
00:04:47,026 --> 00:04:50,357
<i>- Shall I read to you?
- No, thanks.</i>

9
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:57,276
<i>Good night, Grandpa.</i>

10
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,539
<i>Hi! I'm Tommy.
And you?</i>

11
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,991
<i>Rebecca.</i>

12
00:05:36,553 --> 00:05:38,129
<i>Have you moved here?</i>

13
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,374
<i>No, my grandpa lives here,
I'm staying with him.</i>

14
00:06:57,446 --> 00:07:00,647
<i>Rebecca, your grandfather's on the phone.</i>

15
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:06,646
<i>She's fallen asleep.
Shall I wake her up?</i>

16
00:07:09,491 --> 00:07:12,398
<i>No. Not at all.
That's fine.</i>

17
00:07:12,855 --> 00:07:14,566
<i>She's welcome to stay tonight.</i>

18
00:07:20,162 --> 00:07:21,915
<i>Good night!</i>

19
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:28,637
<i>Tell me where we're going.</i>

20
00:10:35,688 --> 00:10:38,640
<i>Up till now, he's only seen
blades of grass before.</i>

21
00:10:39,523 --> 00:10:42,724
<i>It must seem like a
different planet to him.</i>

22
00:10:44,274 --> 00:10:47,688
<i>Tomorrow we'll take him on the beach
and show him the sea.</i>

23
00:10:49,484 --> 00:10:52,981
<i>I won't be here tomorrow.
I'm going away.</i>

24
00:10:56,403 --> 00:10:59,355
<i>Are you going home?</i>

25
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,232
<i>- No.
- Where then?</i>

26
00:11:04,906 --> 00:11:08,107
<i>- To Tokyo.
- Japan?</i>

27
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,912
<i>- What for?
- My mother was there job.</i>

28
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:15,759
<i>Mom's got a job there.</i>

29
00:11:15,993 --> 00:11:20,783
<i>- We'll be living on the 72nd floor.
- 72nd?</i>

30
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:25,911
<i>That's high.</i>

31
00:11:27,372 --> 00:11:30,324
<i>I have to go.</i>

32
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,696
<i>- Hi?
- Rebecca?</i>

33
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,923
<i>Where are you?</i>

34
00:12:12,924 --> 00:12:15,887
<i>On the beach, I came out to look to the storm.</i>

35
00:12:17,015 --> 00:12:21,969
<i>- When are you going tomorrow?
- I'm leaving at six, on the ferry.</i>

36
00:12:23,183 --> 00:12:27,048
<i>I'll see you off, I've got a good idea.</i>

37
00:12:29,185 --> 00:12:32,268
<i>- Rebecca?
- Yes, I'm here.</i>

38
00:12:34,646 --> 00:12:39,435
<i>Tommy, hello?
Tommy?</i>

39
00:13:18,202 --> 00:13:21,616
<i>It's time, Rebecca.</i>

40
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:12,982
<i>- Excuse me.
- What can I do for you?</i>

41
00:15:14,576 --> 00:15:18,785
<i>- I've come to see Tommy.
- Oh, he hasn't lived here for a long time.</i>

42
00:15:22,871 --> 00:15:25,823
<i>You look very familiar.
Have I met you somewhere before?</i>

43
00:15:26,914 --> 00:15:29,664
<i>I'm Rebecca.</i>

44
00:15:34,124 --> 00:15:37,906
<i>Rebecca... The little girl,
that went to Japan?</i>

45
00:15:40,918 --> 00:15:45,494
<i>For a while, Tommy nagged us
about going to Tokyo.</i>

46
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:50,794
<i>But then he forgot about it, luckily.</i>

47
00:15:54,548 --> 00:15:57,168
<i>Where does he live now?</i>

48
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:01,581
<i>Do you know the little harbor
down by the embankment?</i>

49
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:05,593
<i>You'll find him there.</i>

50
00:16:19,473 --> 00:16:22,093
<i>Hello?</i>

51
00:16:43,232 --> 00:16:47,097
<i>Who are you?
What are you doing?</i>

52
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:53,438
<i>- I am looking for Thomas.
- I'm Thomas.</i>

53
00:16:58,112 --> 00:17:00,945
<i>Who are you?</i>

54
00:17:09,908 --> 00:17:12,860
<i>Hi, Tom.</i>

55
00:17:24,288 --> 00:17:26,907
<i>Hi.</i>

56
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:30,747
<i>Who is she?</i>

57
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,874
<i>How was Japan?</i>

58
00:17:37,626 --> 00:17:41,039
<i>- Fine.
- 72 th floor.</i>

59
00:17:48,588 --> 00:17:54,704
<i>So, let us like normal people.
I Rous, this volume. And as you name?</i>

60
00:18:03,051 --> 00:18:07,342
<i>- Are you going back?
- No, I finished my degree.</i>

61
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,375
<i>- What did you study?
- Maths.</i>

62
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:13,668
<i>And now?
What do you do now?</i>

63
00:18:14,096 --> 00:18:17,298
<i>I design software for sonar devices.</i>

64
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:24,630
<i>Sonar devices that detects tiny cracks
in underground storage tanks.</i>

65
00:18:29,852 --> 00:18:35,684
<i>Like the kind used in petrol stations,
you know they sometimes crack.</i>

66
00:18:37,813 --> 00:18:40,895
<i>Cool.</i>

67
00:18:44,815 --> 00:18:47,767
<i>So Bingo let you come in just like that?</i>

68
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,758
<i>I've never seen him do that,
he hates strangers usually.</i>

69
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:53,686
<i>Once he bit a girl's thigh,
though it were monthly.</i>

70
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,945
<i>- Maybe he liked your scent.
- Maybe.</i>

71
00:19:05,906 --> 00:19:09,439
<i>Maybe you two just start
sniffing each other?</i>

72
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,613
<i>How many years is it?</i>

73
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:33,866
<i>- Twelve.
- Twelve.</i>

74
00:19:39,293 --> 00:19:42,576
<i>Maybe I should go.</i>

75
00:20:42,189 --> 00:20:45,058
<i>Does Rose know that you're here?</i>

76
00:20:47,608 --> 00:20:50,560
<i>I don't know.</i>

77
00:20:55,777 --> 00:20:57,915
<i>She is your girlfriend, isn't she?</i>

78
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,142
<i>Girlfriend?</i>

79
00:21:09,449 --> 00:21:13,314
<i>I met her yesterday for
the first time in my life.</i>

80
00:21:51,338 --> 00:21:54,622
<i>How long is is since your
grandfather passed away?</i>

81
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,292
<i>Long time ago.</i>

82
00:22:01,925 --> 00:22:05,126
<i>It's odd.</i>

83
00:22:06,635 --> 00:22:11,923
<i>Seemed bigger in my mind.</i>

84
00:22:17,514 --> 00:22:22,173
<i>Do you remember that night, when
you said you'd see me off because you had an idea...</i>

85
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:26,340
<i>...and you didn't turn up?</i>

86
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:31,142
<i>What was your idea, do you remember?</i>

87
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,139
<i>I thought you'd never ask.</i>

88
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:03,775
<i>I wanted to give him to you that morning.</i>

89
00:23:07,156 --> 00:23:11,945
<i>Tokyo would have been
a great adventure for him.</i>

90
00:23:21,536 --> 00:23:26,195
<i>I fed him, for about a year actually,
after you left.</i>

91
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:33,490
<i>He managed to eat and shit
at the same time.</i>

92
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:38,367
<i>Which is impressive.</i>

93
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:42,209
<i>He looked too good.</i>

94
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:46,202
<i>And one day, he didn't
appear anymore.</i>

95
00:23:49,588 --> 00:23:52,789
<i>He was dead.</i>

96
00:23:56,131 --> 00:23:58,834
<i>Why didn't you come?</i>

97
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:03,253
<i>I overslept.</i>

98
00:24:06,302 --> 00:24:09,052
<i>But now I'm awake.</i>

99
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:49,024
<i>You're cold.</i>

100
00:25:24,787 --> 00:25:26,525
<i>Weird.</i>

101
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:30,288
<i>I know.</i>

102
00:25:32,887 --> 00:25:34,451
<i>Yeah.</i>

103
00:26:25,475 --> 00:26:29,221
<i>- What are you doing this weekend?
- Same as you.</i>

104
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,263
<i>I can't do it.</i>

105
00:26:33,686 --> 00:26:36,436
<i>- I have to go away.
- I'll come with you.</i>

106
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:40,809
<i>I have to go alone.
It'll only be two days.</i>

107
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:44,350
<i>Where were yo go, I go.</i>

108
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:51,482
<i>This is somewhere you can't go.</i>

109
00:26:56,527 --> 00:26:59,859
<i>Then you shouldn't go either.</i>

110
00:27:06,656 --> 00:27:08,040
<i>They simply drained the marsh...</i>

111
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:12,169
<i>...and caught it thousands of tons of
reinforced concrete over there.</i>

112
00:27:12,199 --> 00:27:14,299
<i>They built in six months, which is a record.</i>

113
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,944
<i>On paper, it's a wellness center.
They've called it Sparkling Park.</i>

114
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:23,074
<i>Profit will mainly come from
cyber-prostitution, you know...</i>

115
00:27:23,245 --> 00:27:27,904
<i>...cyber-bitches, the plastic surgery,
cloning of domestic animals.</i>

116
00:27:29,455 --> 00:27:31,326
<i>They opened last week.</i>

117
00:27:31,574 --> 00:27:34,548
<i>This will be their first weekend,
or rather our weekend...</i>

118
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:36,654
<i>...because our group will
be there too.</i>

119
00:27:36,937 --> 00:27:37,722
<i>Group?</i>

120
00:27:37,941 --> 00:27:42,292
<i>Pollungroup. A militant environmental
activist group.</i>

121
00:27:43,085 --> 00:27:47,827
<i>It will be a planned action,
with 23 participants.</i>

122
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,652
<i>We go inside, we cause
mass hysteria Rebecca...</i>

123
00:27:51,653 --> 00:27:55,577
<i>...I'm telling you, mass hysteria,
thus diverting the security guards.</i>

124
00:27:55,578 --> 00:27:59,394
<i>Now, meanwhile outside, the other guys
were blocked the enterance and...</i>

125
00:27:59,395 --> 00:28:01,881
<i>...exit to the carpark with a quick
setting cement pool.</i>

126
00:28:01,883 --> 00:28:05,723
<i>You know quick-cement?
No? Fine, don't worry about it.</i>

127
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:10,958
<i>- Anyway, then the media will turn up...
- How do you do that, mass hysteria?</i>

128
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:31,859
<i>Ready?</i>

129
00:28:51,692 --> 00:28:56,150
<i>You see those rucksacks? We're going to release
the cockroaches from those in the shops.</i>

130
00:28:56,861 --> 00:29:01,069
<i>Around the pools and the restaurants, just
depending on the where the largest crowd are, really.</i>

131
00:29:03,988 --> 00:29:06,940
<i>"Sparkling Park"</i>

132
00:29:13,533 --> 00:29:16,734
<i>I've got six ruckssacks.</i>

133
00:29:31,623 --> 00:29:35,369
<i>- Where are you going? - Away.
- What's all of this you're carrying?</i>

134
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,864
<i>Backpacks.</i>

135
00:29:39,081 --> 00:29:41,956
<i>- Do you want to come in for a coffee?
- No, no, not now.</i>

136
00:29:42,432 --> 00:29:44,187
<i>Well, do I even get a kiss?</i>

137
00:30:02,095 --> 00:30:06,124
<i>- What?
- I love your plan. Did you think it up all by yourself?</i>

138
00:30:06,926 --> 00:30:10,459
<i>A- ha, yeah, of course.</i>

139
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,795
<i>What?</i>

140
00:30:14,052 --> 00:30:18,504
<i>I am but a simple cockroach breeder Rebecca.</i>

141
00:30:19,723 --> 00:30:22,721
<i>I hope that makes me good enough for you.</i>

142
00:30:24,099 --> 00:30:27,929
<i>I've always dreamt of meeting
a cockroach breeder.</i>

143
00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:55,437
<i>I need to pee.</i>

144
00:30:57,277 --> 00:31:00,561
<i>- How badly?
- Badly.</i>

145
00:33:06,864 --> 00:33:12,265
<i>"I will wait for you,
for as long as it takes. "</i>

146
00:36:40,854 --> 00:36:43,520
<i>- I can not eat Rebecca, I'm sorry.
- At least sit down.</i>

147
00:36:43,688 --> 00:36:46,036
<i>At least sit down.</i>

148
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:53,024
<i>I can't sit, either.</i>

149
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:00,275
<i>Would you tell us please
why you invited us here?</i>

150
00:37:02,737 --> 00:37:05,357
<i>Of course.</i>

151
00:37:32,997 --> 00:37:35,700
<i>He could be here with us again.</i>

152
00:37:48,128 --> 00:37:50,961
<i>Again? Who, Thomas?</i>

153
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,215
<i>Department of Genetic Replication
Consent to Exhumation and Taking of Tissue Samples</i>

154
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:15,803
<i>Who would give birth to him?</i>

155
00:38:29,684 --> 00:38:32,054
<i>Ralph.</i>

156
00:38:39,687 --> 00:38:41,285
<i>We are atheists...</i>

157
00:38:43,004 --> 00:38:46,311
<i>...and we brought up Thomas
as an atheist.</i>

158
00:38:46,815 --> 00:38:52,576
<i>But that does not mean we could rummage
in our deceased's grave and clone them.</i>

159
00:38:53,317 --> 00:38:56,399
<i>We are not farm animals.</i>

160
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:01,484
<i>We accept what life gives us...</i>

161
00:39:03,154 --> 00:39:06,300
<i>...and also what it takes away.</i>

162
00:39:06,301 --> 00:39:07,761
<i>But...</i>

163
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:10,534
<i>But what?</i>

164
00:39:17,033 --> 00:39:20,317
<i>But life has also given us
this opportunity.</i>

165
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,862
<i>This gift.</i>

166
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:33,912
<i>Don't you see?</i>

167
00:39:44,335 --> 00:39:49,492
<i>If I were you Rebecca,
I would repaint this room white.</i>

168
00:39:54,852 --> 00:39:57,207
<i>Ralph?</i>

169
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:42,187
<i>Thank you.</i>

170
00:40:48,815 --> 00:40:51,565
<i>Would you like us to move away?</i>

171
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:56,891
<i>No, stay.</i>

172
00:40:59,152 --> 00:41:03,811
<i>He loved the sea,
he'll love it again.</i>

173
00:41:06,071 --> 00:41:08,852
<i>As for us, there is no way we can stay here.</i>

174
00:41:09,513 --> 00:41:11,095
<i>We're moving next week.</i>

175
00:41:12,198 --> 00:41:14,688
<i>Okay.</i>

176
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:18,736
<i>Thank you, Ralph.</i>

177
00:41:21,702 --> 00:41:23,044
<i>Rebecca...</i>

178
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,175
<i>...have a good think about it.</i>

179
00:41:27,704 --> 00:41:30,987
<i>You can still change your mind.</i>

180
00:42:13,053 --> 00:42:15,672
<i>Thank you.</i>

181
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:11,401
<i>- Hi.
- Hello.</i>

182
00:45:12,531 --> 00:45:15,815
<i>- How old is your baby?
- Three months.</i>

183
00:45:17,742 --> 00:45:20,694
<i>Do you want some pie?
Baked it myself.</i>

184
00:45:21,201 --> 00:45:24,070
<i>Thanks, but not now.
I have to go to home.</i>

185
00:45:24,494 --> 00:45:27,908
<i>- Okay.
- Bye. - Bye.</i>

186
00:45:36,081 --> 00:45:39,164
<i>It's alright, baby.</i>

187
00:45:52,087 --> 00:45:54,837
<i>Eat, sweetheart.</i>

188
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:01,256
<i>It's just us two.</i>

189
00:46:32,809 --> 00:46:35,429
<i>Tommy?</i>

190
00:46:36,269 --> 00:46:38,743
<i>Come out for a bit, I want to tell you something.</i>

191
00:46:38,744 --> 00:46:41,156
<i>- What?
- Come out darling.</i>

192
00:46:42,896 --> 00:46:47,685
<i>I know. I know I'll be going to
primary school and I go on Monday.</i>

193
00:46:49,398 --> 00:46:53,524
<i>Yes, on Monday, you'll go to
primary school. But now come out.</i>

194
00:46:54,942 --> 00:46:58,024
<i>I can see you okay from in here.</i>

195
00:47:06,397 --> 00:47:09,604
<i>I have to speak to you
about your daddy.</i>

196
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:17,855
<i>Your daddy died in a car
accident before you were born.</i>

197
00:47:22,035 --> 00:47:24,654
<i>- Really?
- Yes.</i>

198
00:47:25,536 --> 00:47:29,531
<i>- I thought he went back to his home planet.
- His home planet?</i>

199
00:47:30,996 --> 00:47:34,742
<i>- Yes.
- Your father was from this planet.</i>

200
00:47:37,665 --> 00:47:39,221
<i>That's a shame.</i>

201
00:47:39,222 --> 00:47:41,076
<i>Listen Thomas.</i>

202
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,458
<i>Your father was real,
he was a student in biology.</i>

203
00:47:49,086 --> 00:47:51,836
<i>And he was hit by a car.</i>

204
00:47:57,047 --> 00:47:59,999
<i>Do you understand?</i>

205
00:48:40,653 --> 00:48:45,416
<i>A man of words and not of deeds
Is like a garden full of weeds.</i>

206
00:48:45,417 --> 00:48:50,316
<i>And when the weeds begin to grow,
It's like a garden full of snow.</i>

207
00:48:50,317 --> 00:48:55,313
<i>And when the snow begins to fall,
It's like a bird upon the wall.</i>

208
00:48:55,314 --> 00:49:00,364
<i>And when the bird away does fly,
It's like an eagle in the sky.</i>

209
00:49:00,366 --> 00:49:05,418
<i>And when the sky begins to roar,
It's like a lion at the door.</i>

210
00:49:05,419 --> 00:49:10,419
<i>And when the door begins to crack,
It's like a stick across your back.</i>

211
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:15,655
<i>And when your back begins to smart,
It's like a penknife in your heart.</i>

212
00:49:15,656 --> 00:49:23,031
<i>And when your heart begins to bleed,
you're dead, and dead, and dead indeed...</i>

213
00:49:52,212 --> 00:49:55,413
<i>I keep dying.</i>

214
00:49:57,297 --> 00:50:00,249
<i>Try again.</i>

215
00:50:33,267 --> 00:50:36,101
<i>Mom?</i>

216
00:50:42,729 --> 00:50:46,012
<i>Eric's staying over tonight.</i>

217
00:50:48,481 --> 00:50:51,101
<i>Hi.</i>

218
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:56,559
<i>Can I get you anything?</i>

219
00:51:12,448 --> 00:51:15,530
<i>Hi, Mom.
Look at that little rabbit.</i>

220
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:20,983
<i>It's lovely.
What's your name?</i>

221
00:51:21,993 --> 00:51:24,696
<i>I Dima, and that breast.</i>

222
00:51:25,536 --> 00:51:29,400
<i>- Snow Lump or just Lump?
- Just Lump.</i>

223
00:51:46,918 --> 00:51:50,783
<i>Well, we're off.
Bye, Tommy, see you.</i>

224
00:51:58,297 --> 00:52:01,331
<i>Wouldn't you like to come and
play at our house Dima?</i>

225
00:52:03,799 --> 00:52:06,632
<i>No, thank you.</i>

226
00:52:13,552 --> 00:52:16,931
<i>- I can smell it. What about you?
- I could.</i>

227
00:52:16,932 --> 00:52:17,769
<i>What did you smell?</i>

228
00:52:17,804 --> 00:52:20,637
<i>- The copy smell.
- What?</i>

229
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:24,008
<i>Copy smell. Copies have a
weird smell.</i>

230
00:52:24,806 --> 00:52:29,198
<i>- Where did you hear that?
- Oh mom, everyone knows that.</i>

231
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:33,591
<i>They smell like window cleaner.
It comes from their skin.</i>

232
00:52:48,731 --> 00:52:51,434
<i>So?</i>

233
00:53:00,527 --> 00:53:04,059
<i>Eric says that you invited
little Dima into your home.</i>

234
00:53:05,528 --> 00:53:07,899
<i>Yes.
Why?</i>

235
00:53:10,947 --> 00:53:16,367
<i>Look Rebecca, we don't have any
problem with human repliaction...</i>

236
00:53:16,368 --> 00:53:19,344
<i>...we think that some clones are decent people</i>

237
00:53:19,345 --> 00:53:21,530
<i>they have their own lives and rights...</i>

238
00:53:21,826 --> 00:53:26,035
<i>The thing is, it's too complicated
for our kids.</i>

239
00:53:28,203 --> 00:53:32,413
<i>Now we hear about these things in the news
all the time, but quite frankly...</i>

240
00:53:32,448 --> 00:53:36,574
<i>we do not want our children coming up
against these things first hand.</i>

241
00:53:37,123 --> 00:53:40,157
<i>Neither do you, I suppose.</i>

242
00:53:49,877 --> 00:53:52,662
<i>Dima is the victim of
artificial incest.</i>

243
00:53:53,462 --> 00:53:57,208
<i>Her mother gave birth to her own mother.</i>

244
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,962
<i>Did you know that?</i>

245
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:11,924
<i>So, if you'd known, you obviously wouldn't
have invited her into your home, would you?</i>

246
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:25,512
<i>No, of course not.</i>

247
00:54:33,559 --> 00:54:36,428
<i>I'm gonna go now.</i>

248
00:55:05,987 --> 00:55:09,069
<i>Come on Eric.</i>

249
00:55:16,837 --> 00:55:19,327
<i>Come and give me a hand Tommy.</i>

250
00:55:20,214 --> 00:55:23,166
<i>It's your party after all.</i>

251
00:55:39,429 --> 00:55:42,179
<i>Hi.</i>

252
00:56:26,361 --> 00:56:30,771
<i>Molly, it's Rebecca. I just wanted to
make sure you got the invitation?</i>

253
00:56:34,406 --> 00:56:37,275
<i>But he...</i>

254
00:56:51,037 --> 00:56:53,989
<i>I see.</i>

255
00:57:13,018 --> 00:57:15,094
<i>Happy birthday, Tommy.</i>

256
00:57:15,095 --> 00:57:16,137
<i>- But the others aren't...
- There'll just be the two of us, my love.</i>

257
00:57:21,255 --> 00:57:24,208
<i>Two?
But why?</i>

258
00:57:27,025 --> 00:57:32,161
<i>- The others aren't coming.
- Why aren't they coming?</i>

259
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,469
<i>Because of the copy?</i>

260
00:57:41,012 --> 00:57:45,090
<i>But we didn't invite the copy,
we didn't invite her on purpose.</i>

261
00:57:49,523 --> 00:57:54,177
<i>Why aren't they coming mom?
Please?</i>

262
00:57:59,936 --> 00:58:03,349
<i>- Mom!
- Because the mothers...</i>

263
00:58:11,301 --> 00:58:14,135
<i>Their mothers were not allowed.</i>

264
00:58:15,104 --> 00:58:16,900
<i>Why not?</i>

265
00:58:17,192 --> 00:58:21,056
<i>- Because they are stupid.
- Stupid?</i>

266
00:59:15,628 --> 00:59:18,627
<i>Where we going, Mom?</i>

267
00:59:50,241 --> 00:59:53,550
<i>This is exactly how I imagined it.</i>

268
00:59:55,476 --> 00:59:58,558
<i>- Do you like it?
- Yes.</i>

269
01:00:00,602 --> 01:00:04,016
<i>Cool, it's like the end of the world.</i>

270
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:39,073
<i>Mom?</i>

271
01:00:40,991 --> 01:00:44,275
<i>Come quickly.</i>

272
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,912
<i>I thought they were extinct long ago.</i>

273
01:01:16,045 --> 01:01:18,997
<i>Can I take one home?</i>

274
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:24,876
<i>Home?
That's where we are, Tommy.</i>

275
01:02:23,445 --> 01:02:27,433
<i>Tommy?
I'm back.</i>

276
01:02:32,863 --> 01:02:36,147
<i>You can look.</i>

277
01:02:49,616 --> 01:02:54,119
<i>- Cool!
- What are you gonna call him?</i>

278
01:02:57,539 --> 01:02:59,273
<i>I don't know.</i>

279
01:03:01,188 --> 01:03:03,071
<i>Bingo?</i>

280
01:03:04,749 --> 01:03:08,163
<i>Bingo?
No.</i>

281
01:03:14,802 --> 01:03:16,467
<i>Booboo.</i>

282
01:03:18,425 --> 01:03:21,072
<i>- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

283
01:03:24,048 --> 01:03:27,331
<i>Thanks, Mom.</i>

284
01:03:55,475 --> 01:03:58,558
<i>Hi, I'm Mark.</i>

285
01:04:01,144 --> 01:04:03,977
<i>We are neighbors.</i>

286
01:04:10,564 --> 01:04:14,227
<i>- Can I see in your binoculars?
- Sure.</i>

287
01:04:14,982 --> 01:04:17,934
<i>Come on.</i>

288
01:05:24,589 --> 01:05:27,672
<i>And you there when Father died?</i>

289
01:05:30,717 --> 01:05:33,550
<i>Yes.</i>

290
01:05:37,511 --> 01:05:41,257
<i>- How did it happen?
- What made you think of it now?</i>

291
01:05:42,054 --> 01:05:44,757
<i>I do not know.</i>

292
01:05:45,513 --> 01:05:48,596
<i>You know, it was an accident.</i>

293
01:05:52,807 --> 01:05:55,641
<i>What sort of accident?</i>

294
01:05:58,447 --> 01:06:02,806
<i>We were on the road, we stopped,
he got out of the car...</i>

295
01:06:03,478 --> 01:06:07,555
<i>- ... and another car hit him.
- What sort of car?</i>

296
01:06:11,064 --> 01:06:14,182
<i>Van, Tommy, coming very fast.</i>

297
01:06:14,732 --> 01:06:18,229
<i>- What sort of van?
- I do not know.</i>

298
01:06:20,942 --> 01:06:24,356
<i>Why did you stop?</i>

299
01:06:34,197 --> 01:06:38,062
<i>- Why did you stop?
- I had to pee.</i>

300
01:07:37,594 --> 01:07:41,126
<i>Now I can do whatever I want with you.</i>

301
01:07:44,096 --> 01:07:47,261
<i>Go ahead.</i>

302
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:57,721
<i>Tommy?</i>

303
01:08:02,852 --> 01:08:05,686
<i>Tommy?</i>

304
01:10:04,228 --> 01:10:06,847
<i>Good night, Mom.</i>

305
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:24,684
<i>Good night, Tommy!</i>

306
01:10:40,574 --> 01:10:43,775
<i>Everything will be alright my love.</i>

307
01:11:37,302 --> 01:11:40,170
<i>Good morning!</i>

308
01:11:42,472 --> 01:11:47,095
<i>Mom...
Good morning!</i>

309
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:53,266
<i>Weird. I was in university...</i>

310
01:11:54,849 --> 01:11:58,181
<i>...I was a rusty tin...</i>

311
01:11:58,182 --> 01:12:02,851
<i>...or not even a tin,
but some kind of container.</i>

312
01:12:06,835 --> 01:12:11,010
<i>I moved to creak, as the old job.</i>

313
01:12:15,106 --> 01:12:20,346
<i>When I lent down, this rusty sort of
liquid flow through my mouth.</i>

314
01:12:22,692 --> 01:12:25,442
<i>It was cool.</i>

315
01:12:29,737 --> 01:12:32,938
<i>Good morning!</i>

316
01:12:36,989 --> 01:12:40,854
<i>Mom, this is Monica.
Monica, mom.</i>

317
01:12:41,824 --> 01:12:44,906
<i>- Hi.
- Hi.</i>

318
01:12:48,535 --> 01:12:51,569
<i>What did you dream about?</i>

319
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:56,572
<i>Nothing.</i>

320
01:13:00,872 --> 01:13:04,073
<i>Enjoy.</i>

321
01:13:16,854 --> 01:13:19,997
<i>Did we wake you when
we came in last night?</i>

322
01:13:21,671 --> 01:13:24,753
<i>- I wasn't asleep.
- But it was dawn.</i>

323
01:13:25,547 --> 01:13:28,879
<i>Did you ever sleep, Mom?</i>

324
01:13:30,549 --> 01:13:33,501
<i>Sometimes.</i>

325
01:13:39,427 --> 01:13:42,841
<i>Monica went out for couple of things,
she'll be back soon.</i>

326
01:13:44,262 --> 01:13:48,008
<i>She'll be living here for a while, I mean
of course only if you don't mind.</i>

327
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,052
<i>Mom?</i>

328
01:13:55,555 --> 01:13:57,886
<i>She is a nice girl.</i>

329
01:13:59,817 --> 01:14:03,224
<i>Pleased to have her here.</i>

330
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:21,270
<i>...after thought?
I love thinking about this.</i>

331
01:14:21,425 --> 01:14:26,275
<i>Imagine great snow storms over the oceans,
in the mountains, deep in the clouds...</i>

332
01:14:26,276 --> 01:14:28,212
<i>for millions of years on this planet,</i>

333
01:14:28,213 --> 01:14:30,556
<i>...billions of tiny snow crystals have
been whirling about...</i>

334
01:14:30,557 --> 01:14:34,763
<i>...and no two of the are same.
Just like us in fact.</i>

335
01:14:34,998 --> 01:14:38,013
<i>- As people?
- Yeah, as two.</i>

336
01:14:38,048 --> 01:14:41,253
<i>I was thinking of all living things,
not just our faces and our fingerprints.</i>

337
01:14:41,254 --> 01:14:45,241
<i>villus in our lungs, our irises,
the structure of our brains...</i>

338
01:14:45,276 --> 01:14:47,094
<i>...and nails, you know,
everything about us.</i>

339
01:14:47,246 --> 01:14:51,040
<i>I mean, think about, how long the birds here?
They came not long after dinasours.</i>

340
01:14:51,041 --> 01:14:54,637
<i>Basicly, way before us. Can you imagine,
how many billions of feathers they produce...</i>

341
01:14:54,995 --> 01:14:58,326
<i>From ostrich to terns, to hummingbirds, from penguins</i>

342
01:14:58,746 --> 01:15:01,043
<i>Everywhere in the world.
It must be an orbital thing.</i>

343
01:15:01,044 --> 01:15:04,115
<i>A billion times of billion times of billion, you know...</i>

344
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:08,620
<i>There are no two alike.
This is a duck's feather.</i>

345
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:13,149
<i>It's almost incomprehensible, billions
of amazingly complex patterns...</i>

346
01:15:13,150 --> 01:15:16,035
<i>...permanently whirling around us
and never repeat themselves.</i>

347
01:15:20,027 --> 01:15:21,675
<i>What's the matter?</i>

348
01:15:21,676 --> 01:15:25,245
<i>I don't know Tommy...
This is so...</i>

349
01:15:27,514 --> 01:15:29,973
<i>...so immature.</i>

350
01:15:29,974 --> 01:15:34,068
<i>- Really?
- Yes, really.</i>

351
01:15:35,426 --> 01:15:37,221
<i>So?</i>

352
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:42,981
<i>- So what?
- Do you like kids?</i>

353
01:16:23,642 --> 01:16:24,934
<i>Come in.</i>

354
01:16:26,211 --> 01:16:27,589
<i>Hi Mom.</i>

355
01:16:28,152 --> 01:16:30,855
<i>Smells great, doesn't it?</i>

356
01:16:31,203 --> 01:16:34,653
<i>Monica baked it, I was the kitchen boy.</i>

357
01:16:35,089 --> 01:16:38,481
<i>- He is a very good kitchen boy.
- Thank you very much.</i>

358
01:16:41,824 --> 01:16:44,657
<i>Thanks.</i>

359
01:16:48,534 --> 01:16:52,399
<i>- I'm not hungry now, I'll have it later.
- Okay.</i>

360
01:17:57,225 --> 01:17:59,844
<i>Mom.</i>

361
01:18:08,937 --> 01:18:12,020
<i>Good night!</i>

362
01:18:20,485 --> 01:18:22,093
<i>I don't think she's been up for the day.</i>

363
01:18:22,701 --> 01:18:26,642
<i>- I think you should talk to her.
- And what shall I say it?</i>

364
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:23,728
<i>Mom?</i>

365
01:20:24,776 --> 01:20:27,858
<i>It's you.</i>

366
01:20:56,870 --> 01:20:59,620
<i>Wait.</i>

367
01:21:09,291 --> 01:21:12,243
<i>- Hang on.
- Why?</i>

368
01:21:21,295 --> 01:21:24,164
<i>I have to take a shower.</i>

369
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:29,664
<i>Let's take one together.</i>

370
01:21:56,183 --> 01:21:59,384
<i>Tommy, don't.</i>

371
01:22:00,809 --> 01:22:03,891
<i>No, no!
No.</i>

372
01:22:11,146 --> 01:22:13,718
<i>Stop it.</i>

373
01:23:23,772 --> 01:23:27,792
<i>- Wait.
- What? What's wrong?</i>

374
01:23:29,048 --> 01:23:32,130
<i>I think she woke up.</i>

375
01:24:40,823 --> 01:24:43,905
<i>Aren't you going to say anything?</i>

376
01:25:24,588 --> 01:25:27,421
<i>Hello.</i>

377
01:25:35,008 --> 01:25:38,209
<i>Can I help you?</i>

378
01:25:59,058 --> 01:26:02,472
<i>Go inside now Tommy.</i>

379
01:26:09,604 --> 01:26:12,805
<i>Who are you?</i>

380
01:26:55,036 --> 01:26:57,442
<i>Who is that, Mom?</i>

381
01:27:10,333 --> 01:27:12,953
<i>Mom.</i>

382
01:28:18,273 --> 01:28:21,438
<i>Who was that woman, Mom?</i>

383
01:28:34,904 --> 01:28:37,986
<i>Tommy?</i>

384
01:28:42,531 --> 01:28:45,234
<i>Tommy?</i>

385
01:30:35,112 --> 01:30:38,313
<i>I know her.</i>

386
01:31:15,793 --> 01:31:18,745
<i>Tommy?</i>

387
01:31:27,054 --> 01:31:30,791
<i>Let me in, please.</i>

388
01:31:31,882 --> 01:31:35,295
<i>You've been in there for hours.</i>

389
01:31:37,259 --> 01:31:40,756
<i>Please, open the door.</i>

390
01:31:48,304 --> 01:31:51,256
<i>I'm leaving.</i>

391
01:32:57,828 --> 01:33:00,199
<i>Mom?</i>

392
01:33:07,373 --> 01:33:10,206
<i>Mom?</i>

393
01:33:40,510 --> 01:33:43,674
<i>I have to tell you something.</i>

394
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:54,129
<i>I was nine,
I was on the beach...</i>

395
01:33:56,473 --> 01:33:59,556
<i>It was so cold.</i>

396
01:34:01,892 --> 01:34:04,926
<i>- Then I met this boy?
- What, what, what boy?</i>

397
01:34:05,262 --> 01:34:09,348
<i>What beach? Who cares?
Who is this woman, Mother?</i>

398
01:37:41,343 --> 01:37:44,757
<i>No! No!
No!</i>

399
01:38:15,271 --> 01:38:17,891
<i>I'm scared.</i>

400
01:38:21,859 --> 01:38:26,521
<i>I do not know who you are.</i>

401
01:38:29,641 --> 01:38:33,684
<i>Or who I am either.</i>

402
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:43,111
<i>Who are you, Mom?</i>

403
01:38:45,698 --> 01:38:48,532
<i>Who are you?</i>

404
01:38:52,993 --> 01:38:56,075
<i>Why did you do it?</i>

405
01:38:57,619 --> 01:39:00,951
<i>Why did you do this thing?</i>

406
01:39:03,163 --> 01:39:08,305
<i>- Look at yourself, Tommy, you're here.
- So? So? So?</i>

407
01:39:08,563 --> 01:39:12,996
<i>What am I supposed to do now?
What am I supposed to do with this fucking life of mine?</i>

408
01:39:12,998 --> 01:39:15,676
<i>Don't you see I have no idea who I am!</i>

409
01:39:15,914 --> 01:39:19,039
<i>Can't you understand?</i>

410
01:39:20,627 --> 01:39:24,954
<i>- What more could you want?
- More than what?</i>

411
01:39:27,296 --> 01:39:31,042
<i>You're here, Tommy.</i>

412
01:39:32,506 --> 01:39:35,589
<i>You're alive</i>

413
01:39:36,341 --> 01:39:39,423
<i>Take your hands off me.</i>

414
01:39:40,509 --> 01:39:44,635
<i>Take your hands off me.</i>

415
01:39:57,348 --> 01:40:00,300
<i>Who are you?</i>

416
01:40:08,227 --> 01:40:11,345
<i>Who are you?</i>

417
01:40:13,437 --> 01:40:16,187
<i>Who are you?</i>

418
01:40:17,897 --> 01:40:20,849
<i>Who are you?</i>

419
01:43:56,490 --> 01:43:58,364
<i>Thank you...</i>

420
01:44:00,398 --> 01:44:03,082
<i>...Rebecca.</i>
