00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:40,259
<i> That the rest of</i>

5
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:43,162
<i> Our founders built</i>
<i> the wall to keep us safe</i>

6
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:46,598
<i> and they divided us into</i>
<i> five groups, factions,</i>

7
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,167
<i> to keep the peace.</i>

8
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,739

<i> the ones who value</i>

<i> They're all about</i>

14
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,291
<i> Candor value</i>

15
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:15,227
<i> They tell the truth,</i>

<i> wish they wouldn't.</i>

16
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,830
(Cheering)
<i> And then there's dauntless.</i>

17
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:23,802
<i> They're our protectors,</i>
<i> our soldiers, our police.</i>

18
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,904
<i> I always thought</i>
<i> they were amazing.</i>

19
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:31,376
<i> Brave, fearless and free.</i>

20
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,714
<i> Some people think</i>
<i> dauntless are crazy,</i>

21
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,916
<i> which they kind of are.</i>

22
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:39,251
(Laughing)

23
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:40,619
Man: Come on, Beatrice.

24
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:42,654
<i> My faction is abnegation.</i>

25
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,356
<i> The others all</i>
<i> call us "stiffs."</i>

26
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,459
<i> We lead a simple life,</i>

27
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:50,662
<i> selfless,</i>
<i> dedicated to helping others.</i>

28
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,864
<i> We even feed the factionless,</i>

29
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,566
<i> the ones who</i>
<i> don't fit in anywhere.</i>

30
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,337
<i> Because we're public servants,</i>

31
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:01,273
<i> we're trusted to</i>
<i> run the government.</i>

32
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:04,276
<i> My father works alongside</i>
<i> our leader, Marcus.</i>

33
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,849
<i> It all works.</i>
<i> Everyone knows</i>
<i> where they belong.</i>

34
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,418
<i> Except for me.</i>

35
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,289
(Snipping)

36
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,898
<i> My mother says</i>

<i> losing yourself.</i>

37
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,938
<i> But I haven't</i>
<i> figured it out yet.</i>

38
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,440
<i> I'm supposed to</i>
<i> never think of myself,</i>

39
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,309
<i> to always help others.</i>

40
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,446
<i> To never look too</i>
<i> long in the mirror.</i>

41
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,485
Are you nervous?

42
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:47,953
(Inhales deeply)

43
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:48,954
No.

44
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,358
Were you? For your test?

45
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,393
Mmm-mm. No.

46
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:56,461
I was terrified.

47
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,664
(Chuckles softly)

48
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,633
But I didn't have
any reason to be
and neither do you.

49
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,743
That's all you get.

50
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,847
Rules are rules.

51
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,423
Tris:<i> Today I take the test.</i>

52
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,962
<i> I'm scared it'll tell</i>
<i> me I'm not abnegation.</i>

53
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,864
<i> That I have to</i>
<i> leave my family.</i>

54
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,002
<i> But I'm even more scared</i>
<i> that it will tell me to stay.</i>

55
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,807
<i> For my brother Caleb,</i>
<i> it's easy.</i>

56
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:42,841
Caleb: Let me help you
with that.

57
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,476
Tris:<i> He's a natural.</i>

58
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,347
Beatrice, do you
wanna get the other bags?

59
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:49,781
Sorry.

60
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:50,949
Caleb: What if she'd been
blind or an amputee?

61
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,384
Would you have
helped her then?

62
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,119
I was thinking
about helping her.

63
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:55,654
Caleb: It's not that hard.

64
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:57,956
For you, maybe.

65
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,726
Just relax, Beatrice.
Take a deep breath
and trust the test.

66
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,563
Tris:<i> Trust the test.</i>

67
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,898
<i> Test will tell me who</i>
<i> I am, where I belong.</i>

68
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:10,969
<i> Am I smart?</i>

69
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,706
<i> Kind?</i>

70
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,707
<i> Am I honest?</i>

71
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,510
<i> Selfless?</i>

72
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,413
<i> Or brave?</i>

73
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:25,450
Hey. So, all the food
that we're not getting,

74
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,686
you guys are giving away
to the factionless?

75
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:29,621
Right? Yeah?
Yeah.

76
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:32,557
You're a liar.
Why are you lying to me?

77
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,059
Everybody knows
you keep it for yourselves.

78
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,494
So why don't
you just admit it?

79
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,530
Huh?

80
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,899
I'm talking to you.
Are all you stiffs
deaf or somethin'? Hey!

81
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:43,902
Beatrice...

82
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,037
Don't.

83
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:49,508
(Sighs)

84
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,079
(Train approaching)

85
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,186
(Shouting indistinctly)

86
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,972
One hundred years ago,
after the war,

87
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,208
our founders created
a system they believed

88
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,711
would prevent future conflict
and create lasting peace.

89
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,648
Today, aptitude testing
based on your personality

90
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,818
will assign you to
one of the factions.

91
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,853
While it is our belief that
choosing the faction

92
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,655
indicated by your test
is the best way to ensure

93
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:39,858
success within
the faction system,

94
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,761
it is your right tomorrow
at the choosing ceremony

95
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:44,796
<i> to choose any of</i>
<i> the five factions,</i>

96
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,998
<i> regardless of</i>
<i> your test results.</i>

97
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,469
<i> However, once</i>
<i> the choice has been made,</i>

98
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:52,604
<i> there will be no</i>
<i> change permitted.</i>

99
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,075
(Woman on pa
speaking indistinctly)

100
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,791
What is it with you
abnegation and mirrors?

101
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,628
We reject vanity.

102
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,762
Yeah. I know. Sit down.

103
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,546
I'm Tori. I'll be
administering your test.

104
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:36,615
You'll be offered
a series of choices

105
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,817
to test your
aptitude for each faction

106
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:40,519
until you get one result.

107
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,054
I wouldn't sweat it.

108
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,156
95% get
the faction of their origin,

109
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:46,858
and from the looks of you...

110
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,797
What is it?

111
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:53,932
Bottoms up.

112
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,175
(Sighs)

113
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,947
Choose.

114
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:19,684
Now. Before it's too late.

115
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,020
Why? What will I
do with them?

116
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:23,121
Choose.

117
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,823
Just tell me.

118
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:25,890
(Dog barks)

119
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,209
(Gasps)

120
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,049
(Dog snarling)

121
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,425
(Dog whining)

122
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,364
Little girl: Puppy!

123
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:13,838
(Snarling)

124
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,812
(Barking)

125
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:24,816
(Gasps)

126
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,021
Get up.

127
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,956
We're going out the back door
before a supervisor comes.

128
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,858
But what was my result?
Come on!

129
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,062
What happened?

130
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:39,064
You're going to
tell your family
that the serum made you sick

131
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,165
and that I sent you home.
All right?

132
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,067
No, but what was my result?

133
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,202
Abnegation.

134
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,339
And erudite.
And dauntless.

135
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,109
Dauntless...

136
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,211
Your results
were inconclusive.

137
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,146
That's impossible.
It doesn't make any sense.

138
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:56,981
No. Not impossible.

139
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,283
It's just extremely rare.

140
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,387
They call it "divergent."

141
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,791
You can't tell
anyone about this.
Not even your parents.

142
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,760
As far as
the world is concerned,

143
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:11,062
you received
an abnegation result because

144
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,497
that is what I
manually entered.

145
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:15,333
So what am I supposed to do
at the choosing ceremony?

146
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,769
I was supposed to
learn what to do.

147
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,471
This was supposed to tell me
what faction to choose,
the test.

148
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:20,972
We're supposed
to trust the test.

149
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:23,441
The test didn't work on you.

150
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,479
You have to trust yourself.

151
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,802
(Man coughing)

152
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,920
(Door closes)

153
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,495
What happened to you today?

154
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,831
Where did you go
after your test?

155
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,467
I got sick,
so they sent me home early.

156
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,269
Did you finish your test?

157
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:25,336
Mmm-hmm.

158
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,574
What was your result?

159
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,379
What was yours?

160
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,083
Andrew: Why did you just leave
without telling anybody?

161
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:40,351
I was sick.

162
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,855
Andrew: Beatrice...

163
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:46,891
I don't think you understand
the level of
scrutiny we're under.

164
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:49,494
They're doing
everything they can
to discredit us right now.

165
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:51,563
Who is?

166
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:53,832
Erudite.

167
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,568
They believe that they should
be the governing faction,
not us.

168
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,503
So you have to be
careful right now, okay?

169
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,538
Even Marcus is under attack.

170
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,539
For what?

171
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,010
It's an old accusation.

172
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,913
That he mistreated his son

173
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:10,148
and that's why
the boy defected.

174
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,151
Is that true?
No.

175
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:14,953
'Course not.

176
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:16,521
Children defect for
all kinds of reasons.

177
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:28,233
Don't take too long in here.
You need a good
night's sleep...

178
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,869
For tomorrow.

179
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,007
I, um...

180
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,547
We love you.

181
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,361
Good night.

182
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,431
Natalie: (Softly)
I'm so proud of you,
honey.

183
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:01,499
(Sighs)

184
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,977
Caleb: Beatrice?
What?

185
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,514
Tomorrow when we choose...

186
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,019
You have to
think of the family.

187
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,420
Yeah.

188
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,556
But you also have
to think of yourself.

189
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,930
(Indistinct conversations)

190
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,631
(Woman on pa speaking
indistinctly in distance)

191
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,618
(All speaking indistinctly)

192
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,589
(Man on pa
speaking indistinctly)

193
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,560
(Indistinct talking)

194
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:12,603
Man: (On pa)
<i> Factions, please gather</i>
<i> in your assigned areas.</i>

195
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,346
Morning, jeanine.

196
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:24,749
Good morning, Andrew.
How is Marcus holding up?

197
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:27,151
As well as can be expected.

198
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,620
We need to find out
who's behind these rumors.

199
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:33,091
I think we all know
who it is.

200
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:37,328
If it's someone from erudite,
I promise I'll find out who.

201
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,763
These are your children.

202
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:40,231
I don't think I knew
they were choosing today.

203
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:42,266
What's your name?
I'm... I'm Caleb.

204
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:43,368
It's a pleasure to meet you.

205
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,602
Jeanine Matthews.

206
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,571
And you are?

207
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:48,006
This is Beatrice.

208
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,710
Well, you both have a big
decision to make today.

209
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:55,546
I'm sure your
parents will support
whatever choice you make.

210
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,615
That's not
supposed to be a choice.

211
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,019
The test should
tell us what to do.

212
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,488
You're still free to choose.

213
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,189
But you don't
really want that.

214
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,424
Beatrice...

215
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,562
I want you to
choose who you truly are

216
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:14,098
and where you truly belong.

217
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,435
Not on a whim.
Not because you wish
you were someone you're not.

218
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:20,738
But because you
honestly know yourself.

219
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,740
I want you
to choose wisely.

220
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,309
And I know you will.

221
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,378
(Applause)

222
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:34,485
The faction system
is a living being

223
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:38,589
composed of cells, all of you.

224
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:41,225
And the only way it
can survive and thrive

225
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:45,496
is for each of you
to claim your rightful place.

226
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:49,634
The future belongs to those
who know where they belong.

227
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,175
When we leave this room,

228
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:59,677
you will no
longer be dependents

229
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,679
but full-fledged
members of our society.

230
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,149
Faction before blood.

231
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,685
All: Faction before blood.

232
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,257
I love you...

233
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,726
No matter what.

234
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:19,797
Marcus: Jonathan ziegler.

235
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,715
Marcus: Erudite.
(All applauding)

236
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:40,785
Marcus: Jeffrey yates.

237
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,522
Dauntless.
(All cheering)

238
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,492
Morgan Stokes.

239
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:51,696
Amity.

240
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,234
(Sobbing)

241
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,838
Marcus: Claire satron. Candor.

242
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,608
Sam robertson. Abnegation.

243
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,677
Caleb prior.

244
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:28,866
Erudite.
(Faint gasps)

245
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:30,868
(All applauding)

246
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:41,879
Marcus: Quiet, please.

247
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,449
Beatrice prior.

248
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,309
Dauntless.

249
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:46,377
(All dauntless cheering)

250
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,423
Welcome to dauntless!

251
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,012
(All cheering)

252
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:42,126
Boy: Come on! Let's go!

253
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:05,049
Girl: Come on!

254
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:16,694
Sorry.

255
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:18,929
You made it.

256
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,666
I'm Christina.
Beatrice.

257
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,872
Is it just me or are
they trying to kill us?

258
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,620
Get ready!

259
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:45,589
(Woman on pa announcing
indistinctly)

260
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:03,707
Yeah!

261
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:06,744
They're jumping.
What?

262
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,847
(Whooping continues)

263
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:11,182
What if you don't jump?

264
00:24:11,184 --> 00:24:13,584
What do you think?
You'll be factionless.

265
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:15,586
Good luck, Al.

266
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:17,755
Whoa! (Grunts)

267
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,091
(Whooping)

268
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,131
Together?
Yeah.

269
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,968
One, two, three...

270
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:34,972
(Both grunting)

271
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:42,246
(Both laughing)

272
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,518
Eric: All right, listen up!

273
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:52,490
I'm Eric.
I'm one of your leaders.

274
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:54,725
If you want to
enter dauntless,
this is the way in.

275
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:56,660
And if you don't
have the guts to jump,

276
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,729
then you don't
belong in dauntless.

277
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,698
Is there water at
the bottom or something?

278
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,899
I guess you'll find out.

279
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,503
Or not.

280
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:07,872
We just jumped.
They want us to jump again?

281
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:09,273
Someone's gotta go first.
Who's it gonna be?

282
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:21,619
Me.

283
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:47,645
Yeah, stiff, take it off!

284
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:49,747
Put it back on!

285
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:01,692
(Grunts)

286
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,239
Today, initiate.

287
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:22,846
(Gasps)

288
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:27,818
(Gasps)

289
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:31,855
(Panting)

290
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:43,233
(Chuckling)

291
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,741
What, you get pushed?

292
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:51,742
No.

293
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,280
What's your name?

294
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:57,615
It's...

295
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:01,085
Is that a hard one?

296
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:03,087
You can pick
a new one if you want,
but make it good.

297
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:04,822
You don't get to pick again.

298
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:09,994
Okay... my name's tris.

299
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,365
First jumper, tris!

300
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:15,366
(People cheering)
Welcome to dauntless.

301
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,270
(Boy screaming)

302
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,075
(Shrieks)

303
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,984
Dauntless-born,
go with Lauren,
transfers stay with me.

304
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:36,120
Go.

305
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:37,187
Lauren: This way.

306
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,258
Most of the time I
work in intelligence,

307
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,961
but during your training,
I'll be your instructor.

308
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,697
My name's four.

309
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:47,931
Four like the number?

310
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,701
Exactly like the number.

311
00:27:50,703 --> 00:27:52,870
What happened,
one through three were taken?

312
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,276
What's your name?

313
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:00,344
Christina.

314
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:08,352
Well, Christina.

315
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,854
The first lesson
you learn from me

316
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,456
if you wanna survive here,

317
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:13,991
is keep your mouth shut.

318
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,994
Do you understand me?

319
00:28:16,996 --> 00:28:18,162
(Softly) Yes.

320
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,398
Good.

321
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,002
Follow me.

322
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,327
(Indistinct talking
and cheering)

323
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,215
The center of life
here at dauntless.

324
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:17,855
(Cheering and shouting)

325
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,396
You're gonna be sleeping here
for the next 10 weeks.

326
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:28,899
Girls or boys?

327
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,301
Both.

328
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:33,270
Girl 1: Nice.
Boy 1: That works.

329
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,339
If you like this,
you're gonna
love the bathroom.

330
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:37,341
Girl 2: Great.

331
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:41,512
Boy 1: Okay...

332
00:29:41,514 --> 00:29:43,280
Girl 2: Seriously?
Boy 2: Is there no other area?

333
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:46,450
Girl 2: Are you kidding?

334
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:47,951
You should feel
right at home, candor.

335
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,853
Everything out in the open.

336
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:51,455
Boy 2: Is this a joke?

337
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:52,556
Four: Get changed.

338
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:56,860
Right. Shower, anyone?

339
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:01,331
(Indistinct talking)

340
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,500
Peter: Nice legs, stiff.

341
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,121
(Indistinct talking)

342
00:30:24,123 --> 00:30:25,522
(Rock music playing)

343
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,606
Boy 1: Hey.
Boy 2: How you doin'?

344
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,076
Shall we sit there?

345
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:09,199
Have you never seen
a hamburger before?

346
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:12,269
No, I've seen one.
I just have never eaten one.

347
00:31:12,271 --> 00:31:14,171
Abnegation eat plain food.

348
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:17,441
Plant-based
diet with no sauces
and a minimum of seasoning.

349
00:31:17,443 --> 00:31:18,609
Which textbook
did you swallow?

350
00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:20,177
(Chuckles)

351
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:23,013
Nice to meet you, too.
I'm will. Erudite.

352
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:26,149
Of course you are.

353
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:28,518
No offense, but I'm surprised
abnegation even eats at all.

354
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,388
Too selfish, right?
No wonder you left.

355
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,423
You gotta be
pretty self-confident
to be friends with a candor.

356
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:34,625
What is that supposed to mean?

357
00:31:34,627 --> 00:31:36,326
You have no filter.

358
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:37,961
You say the first thing
that comes into your head.

359
00:31:37,963 --> 00:31:39,129
You mean like,
"you're an idiot"?

360
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:40,364
(All chuckling)

361
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:42,599
Nice one, Al.
At least we tell the truth.

362
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:45,035
Erudite can tell the truth
because we have the facts.

363
00:31:45,037 --> 00:31:46,169
I don't want to hear
about your old factions.

364
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:51,174
You're dauntless now.

365
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:54,611
Were you a transfer, too?
Or dauntless-born?

366
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:57,514
Are you kidding?

367
00:31:58,516 --> 00:31:59,616
No.

368
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,121
What makes you think
you can talk to me?

369
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:08,058
It...

370
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,328
Must be because
you're so approachable.

371
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,329
(Christina scoffs)

372
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:21,939
Careful.

373
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:25,475
Man: Four...
(Speaking indistinctly)

374
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:29,046
You, my friend,
have a death wish.

375
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:32,316
(Whispering) You know,
he was first in his class.

376
00:32:32,318 --> 00:32:34,384
They tried to recruit him
for leadership twice,

377
00:32:34,386 --> 00:32:35,686
but he said no.

378
00:32:35,688 --> 00:32:36,687
(Alarm blaring)

379
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:39,056
(Cups clattering)

380
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,627
(Clanking continues)

381
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:50,300
Initiates, stand.

382
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,209
You have chosen to
join the warrior faction

383
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:03,113
tasked with
the defense of this city
and all its inhabitants.

384
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:06,216
We believe in
ordinary acts of bravery

385
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:09,252
and the courage
that drives one person

386
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:11,054
to stand up for another.

387
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:13,290
Respect that.

388
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,592
Do us proud.

389
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:19,463
(All cheering)

390
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,600
(Laughing)

391
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,171
Whoa!

392
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:35,379
(Laughing)

393
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,784
(Cheering)

394
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,668
(Metal clanking loudly)

395
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,607
I want everyone in the pit.
Two minutes.

396
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,610
(Man yelling orders)

397
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,647
(People speaking indistinctly)

398
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,451
There are two
stages of training.

399
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:16,820
The first is physical.

400
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:18,522
Push your bodies to
the breaking point

401
00:34:18,524 --> 00:34:20,123
and you'll master
the methods of combat.

402
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:24,094
The second is mental.
Again, breaking point.

403
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:25,829
You'll face your worst fears
and conquer them

404
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:28,331
unless they get you first.

405
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,333
You'll be trained separately
from the dauntless-born,

406
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:32,436
but you'll be ranked together.

407
00:34:32,438 --> 00:34:36,673
After initiations,
rankings will determine
what jobs you move into.

408
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:39,643
Leadership,
guarding the fence,

409
00:34:39,645 --> 00:34:41,445
or keeping the factionless
from killing each other.

410
00:34:41,447 --> 00:34:43,447
The rankings will also
determine who gets cut.

411
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,318
Cut?

412
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,420
At the end of each
stage of training,
the lowest-ranking initiates

413
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,322
will be leaving us.

414
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:54,591
To do what?

415
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:57,694
There's no going
home to your families,
so you'd live factionless.

416
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,164
Why didn't we know that?

417
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:03,133
It's a new rule.

418
00:35:03,135 --> 00:35:04,134
A new rule?
Somebody should
have told us that.

419
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:05,435
Eric: Why?

420
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,604
Would you have
chosen differently?

421
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:10,407
Out of fear?

422
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:13,844
I mean, if that's the case,
you might as well get out now.

423
00:35:13,846 --> 00:35:16,847
If you're really one of us,
it won't matter to
you that you might fail.

424
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:19,749
Now you chose us.

425
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,886
Now we get to choose you.

426
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,656
(Panting)

427
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:36,166
(Grunting)

428
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,377
(Sighs)

429
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:48,678
Statistically speaking,
you should have hit the target

430
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,880
at least once by now.

431
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:52,482
Even by accident.

432
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,258
Hey. What have you got?

433
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,661
Factionless.
Not doing anything.

434
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,796
Check it out, stiff.
That's gonna be
your new family.

435
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:08,532
(Baby crying)
(Bottles clinking)

436
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,169
Go say "hi."

437
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,311
You ready for
some real fighting?

438
00:36:21,313 --> 00:36:23,180
Not even close.

439
00:36:23,182 --> 00:36:24,181
Eric: First jumper!

440
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:27,484
In the ring.

441
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:30,820
Last jumper!

442
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:33,890
Time to fight.

443
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,727
(Indistinct murmurings)

444
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,266
How long do we fight for?

445
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:45,202
Till one of you
can't continue.

446
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:46,836
Or one of you concedes.

447
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:48,638
According to the old rules.

448
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,707
New rules, no one concedes.

449
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,511
You really want to lose
'em on their first fight?

450
00:36:54,513 --> 00:36:56,613
A brave man never surrenders.

451
00:36:56,615 --> 00:37:00,283
Lucky for you, those weren't
the rules when we fought.

452
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:01,518
You'll be scored on this,
so fight hard.

453
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:06,756
Go!

454
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,911
Peter: Don't be scared, stiff!

455
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:33,350
(Grunts)
Christina: Nice, tris!

456
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,754
(Grunts)
(Gasps)

457
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:48,765
Boy 1: Nice.
Boy 2: Yeah!

458
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:56,873
(Indistinct conversations)

459
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:58,675
All right, guys, over here.

460
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,444
Listen up.

461
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:06,650
Know what this board is?

462
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:09,019
It's your life.

463
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:11,921
We grade you every day.

464
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:13,823
If you're still in the red by
the end of the first stage,

465
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:15,058
you're out.

466
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,561
Tris:<i> I'm never gonna make it.</i>

467
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:20,430
Christina: Yes, you are.

468
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:21,998
I'm the weakest one here.

469
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,900
Then you'll be most improved.

470
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,437
You're candor.
You're not supposed to lie.

471
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:31,374
I was candor.
And I'm not lying.

472
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:33,877
If they cut me, I think my
parents would take me back.

473
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:37,414
Will: No, it doesn't
work like that.

474
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:40,317
Even if they wanted to,
their faction
wouldn't allow it.

475
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:42,585
Even if my parents
would take me back,

476
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:45,955
I wouldn't
belong there anymore.

477
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:47,957
This is getting depressing.

478
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:49,592
Al: (Chuckling) Yeah.

479
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:51,661
Christina: You know
what we should do?
Get tattoos.

480
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,930
(Hip-hop music playing)

481
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,537
Will: Did you know they had
a tattoo of your face?

482
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:03,673
Like it?
Will: Yeah.

483
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,375
Where would you get it?
I don't know.

484
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:07,577
Where do you suggest?

485
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:09,879
Anywhere you want.

486
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:12,749
Here, it's this thing here.

487
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,601
You remember me, right?

488
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,371
I was just wondering
if you could...

489
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:35,438
No.

490
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:38,074
I just do tattoos.

491
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,580
Okay.

492
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:55,959
I'd like this one.

493
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,128
Please.

494
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,730
(Powering up)

495
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,670
Can I just ask you...

496
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:10,707
You made a mistake
choosing dauntless.

497
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:12,542
They'll find out about you...
Who?

498
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,145
Who will?

499
00:40:15,147 --> 00:40:16,546
The people
you're a threat to.

500
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:17,881
What people? Who, dauntless?

501
00:40:17,883 --> 00:40:19,983
No, society.

502
00:40:19,985 --> 00:40:22,452
If you don't fit
into a category,
they can't control you.

503
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:26,122
I don't get it.

504
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:27,891
I'm dauntless.
I'm going to be dauntless.

505
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:29,159
I chose dauntless.

506
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:34,731
Tori: For your sake,
I hope so.

507
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:46,476
(Grunts)

508
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,651
(Punches rapidly landing )

509
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:46,135
You're weak.
You have no muscle.

510
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,742
You're never gonna win,
not like that.

511
00:41:52,744 --> 00:41:54,244
That's good to know.
Yeah, you're gonna have to

512
00:41:54,246 --> 00:41:56,613
use your whole body.

513
00:41:56,615 --> 00:41:58,014
Keep tension here.

514
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:03,686
Okay...
And go on offense.

515
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:06,556
You're fast, so you could win
if you attack first.

516
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,225
You get inside,
you jab to the throat.

517
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:12,862
Eric: Four!

518
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,664
Keep working.

519
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:22,872
(Groaning)

520
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,908
Al: Sorry about that, will.

521
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,175
(Christina grunting)

522
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:34,651
Come on, Chris.

523
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:41,858
(Grunts)

524
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,627
Stop... stop!

525
00:42:44,629 --> 00:42:47,664
(Coughs)
I'm done. I'm done.

526
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:48,665
You need to stop?

527
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,335
(Panting)
Okay.

528
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:55,271
Let me give you a hand.

529
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,714
Thanks.

530
00:43:04,716 --> 00:43:06,215
All right,
let's everyone take a break!

531
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:17,260
You feelin' a little better?

532
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:19,028
Yeah, I'm fine.

533
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,096
(Shrieks)

534
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:21,164
Whoa!

535
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:26,002
Eric: Grab the rail.
(Grunting)

536
00:43:26,004 --> 00:43:27,370
Or don't.
(Gasps)

537
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:31,708
You've got three options.

538
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,943
Hang there and I'll
forget your cowardice.

539
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:35,078
Fall and die.

540
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,145
(Christina groaning)

541
00:43:36,147 --> 00:43:37,647
Or give up.

542
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:40,149
But if you give up,
you're out.

543
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:48,858
(Christina panting)

544
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:50,960
(Grunts)

545
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:52,261
Come on, Chris!

546
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:54,330
(Christina groaning)

547
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,035
(Metal creaking)

548
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:03,973
(Straining)

549
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:09,278
Time!

550
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:12,682
(Continues grunting)

551
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,319
(Panting)

552
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:19,155
Dauntless never give up.

553
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,958
(Panting)

554
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,027
(Sobbing)

555
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,132
Four: As dauntless,
we fight to protect

556
00:44:29,134 --> 00:44:31,167
every life inside the fence,
without fail.

557
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,737
That's why we train
you the way we do.

558
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,674
To teach you not to give up.

559
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:43,012
And to find out who
has what it takes.

560
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,984
<i> Even though it's been quiet</i>
<i> out there for years,</i>

561
00:44:47,986 --> 00:44:51,054
<i> that could</i>
<i> change at any moment.</i>

562
00:44:51,056 --> 00:44:52,922
<i> So we have to be</i>
<i> ready for everything.</i>

563
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:53,990
Boy: Whoo!

564
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,374
What's out there?

565
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:13,443
Monsters.
(Chuckles)

566
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:15,144
Amity farms.

567
00:45:15,146 --> 00:45:16,979
No, I know. But beyond that?

568
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:18,347
Places that never
recovered from the war.

569
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:21,084
Do you know?

570
00:45:21,086 --> 00:45:23,319
Let's just say they built
their fence for a reason.

571
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,205
(Girl grunting)
Boy: Man!

572
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:47,477
(Boy laughs)

573
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:53,116
You're kinda good at this.

574
00:45:53,118 --> 00:45:54,350
Boy: Come on.

575
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:00,189
(Clanging)

576
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:02,759
That was pathetic.

577
00:46:02,761 --> 00:46:03,826
(Clanging)

578
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:06,896
(Scoffs) It slipped.

579
00:46:06,898 --> 00:46:07,897
Well, go get it!

580
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,237
What, while they're throwing?

581
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:16,105
Are you afraid?

582
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:18,107
Of getting stabbed
by an airborne knife? Yeah.

583
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:19,408
Everybody stop.

584
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,381
Stand in front of the target.

585
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:38,861
Four, gimme a hand here.

586
00:46:38,863 --> 00:46:41,964
You're gonna stand there
while he throws those knives.

587
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:46,836
And if I see you flinch,
you're out.

588
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,306
One thing you will learn here

589
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:52,975
is that orders
are not optional.

590
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,353
(Sighs)

591
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:10,293
Stop.

592
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:18,201
Anyone can stand in
front of a target.
It doesn't prove anything.

593
00:47:18,203 --> 00:47:20,336
Then it should be easy
for you to take his place.

594
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:32,982
Same rules apply.

595
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:36,319
(Sighs)

596
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,159
Oh, come on, four.

597
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,208
You can get closer than that.

598
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,509
You want me to give
her a little trim?

599
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,345
Yeah, maybe just
a little off the top.

600
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:06,515
(Breathing heavily)

601
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:13,389
(Grunts)

602
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,362
Points for bravery, stiff.

603
00:48:19,364 --> 00:48:22,098
Not as many as you just lost
for opening your mouth.

604
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:27,436
Now watch yourself.

605
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:31,073
We train soldiers, not rebels.

606
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:35,111
But we're done for today.
Get out.

607
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:38,381
(Indistinct conversations)

608
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:43,152
You all right?
You cut me.

609
00:48:43,154 --> 00:48:44,487
I meant to.

610
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:47,657
You meant to?

611
00:48:47,659 --> 00:48:50,293
You think he was gonna
let you off without a scratch?

612
00:48:50,295 --> 00:48:54,597
You'd still be standing there
if I hadn't hit you.

613
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:56,565
So am I supposed
to thank you?

614
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:02,271
You're supposed to be smart.

615
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:05,107
If I wanted to hurt you,
I would have.

616
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:17,420
(All cheering)
There she is.

617
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:23,092
You do have a death wish.

618
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:25,294
I can't believe you
said that to Eric.

619
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:26,996
You're the only one
who's ever stood up to him.

620
00:49:26,998 --> 00:49:29,031
Look at your ear.
Let's get you cleaned up.

621
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:30,199
Hey, tris.

622
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:33,202
That was cool.

623
00:49:33,204 --> 00:49:34,470
Thanks.

624
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:37,406
(Chuckles)

625
00:49:37,408 --> 00:49:38,674
(Snickering)

626
00:49:38,676 --> 00:49:41,510
Impressive, stiff. Congrats.

627
00:49:41,512 --> 00:49:42,545
Will: Shut up.

628
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:43,546
What? Hey, you're famous now.

629
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:45,147
Boy: Hold up.

630
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:46,682
I mean, not because
of the thing with Eric.

631
00:49:46,684 --> 00:49:49,151
You're in the news.
Yeah, listen.

632
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:52,588
"The recent transfers
of Beatrice and Caleb prior,

633

Did they beat you,
like Marcus eaton's kid?

642
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:18,147
They didn't beat anyone.
They're good people.

643
00:50:18,149 --> 00:50:20,549
Right.
And that's why you left?

644
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:28,357
Was it something I said?

645

He's an idiot.
Yeah.

646
00:50:29,761 --> 00:50:31,494
Yeah. That's okay.

647
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:40,336
What's she doing at dauntless?

648

Hmm.

655
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:03,526
You made an impressive choice,
tris, despite your parents.

656
00:51:03,528 --> 00:51:05,194
And your test result.

657
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:07,730
You've seen my test result?

658
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:10,566
Of course.

659
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:12,701
I'm glad you were smart enough
to know your own mind.

660
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:17,673
Let me know if you
ever need anything.

661
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,084
Well, that was weird.

662
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,086
Yeah.

663
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:34,390
Al: What do you
think is goin' on?

664
00:51:34,392 --> 00:51:37,460
Will: I bet they're
hunting divergents.

665
00:51:37,462 --> 00:51:39,762
That's all they talk about
at erudite these days.

666
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:44,233
Al: Wait.
Divergents are real?

667
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:45,801
Christina:
Come on, Al.

668
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:56,245
Eric: First fight.
Peter versus tris.

669
00:51:57,714 --> 00:51:59,248
Girl: What?

670
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,249
Boy: Uh-oh.

671
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:03,853
It's Eric.

672
00:52:03,855 --> 00:52:05,788
He's just trying
to get back at you.

673
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,427
Four: Hey.
Tris: What?

674
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:15,364
Remember what I
said about attack?

675
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:17,399
First shot,
right to the throat.

676
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:18,901
And you watch him.

677
00:52:18,903 --> 00:52:21,437
He steps before he punches.

678
00:52:21,439 --> 00:52:22,505
All right?

679
00:52:22,507 --> 00:52:23,572
Mmm.

680
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,648
Peter: All right there, stiff?

681
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:35,351
Look like you're about to cry.

682
00:52:35,353 --> 00:52:36,852
Might take it easy
on you if you cry.

683
00:52:36,854 --> 00:52:38,454
Christina: Come on, tris.
(Grunts)

684
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:40,823
(Grunts)
(Peter gasps)

685
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:01,510
(Grunts)
(Groans)

686
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:04,947
Peter: Get up. Get up.

687
00:53:04,949 --> 00:53:06,815
Come on.
Stop playin' with each other.

688
00:53:06,817 --> 00:53:08,250
(Panting)

689
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:12,188
(Grunts)
(Groans)

690
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,389
(Coughs)

691
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,458
(Breathing heavily)

692
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:54,263
Wow. You look...

693
00:53:54,265 --> 00:53:55,264
Look bad.

694
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:01,270
How long have I been here?

695
00:54:01,272 --> 00:54:02,404
About a day.

696
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:04,573
A day?

697
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:07,009
Have you seen the scoreboard?
Where am I?

698
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:09,411
You got below the line.

699
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:14,883
Why are you
wearing those vests?

700
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:18,287
War games.

701
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:20,856
Whoa. What are you doing?

702
00:54:20,858 --> 00:54:22,391
I'm coming.
You can't.

703
00:54:22,393 --> 00:54:24,026
Will: Eric says you're done.

704
00:54:24,028 --> 00:54:25,561
What?

705
00:54:25,563 --> 00:54:26,795
He said you're out.

706
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:30,866
Your father's on
the council, tris.

707
00:54:30,868 --> 00:54:32,434
Maybe they'll
make an exception
and let you go home.

708
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,472
We're sorry, tris.

709
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:39,541
Will: We gotta go.
We're gonna miss the train.

710
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:41,910
Yeah, okay.

711
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:49,885
Christina: Bye.
Tris: Bye.

712
00:54:49,887 --> 00:54:51,353
Will: Bye.
Tris: Bye.

713
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,464
(Grunts)

714
00:55:35,466 --> 00:55:36,632
Thanks.

715
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:41,003
(Exhales)

716
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,641
Christina: Hi.

717
00:55:45,643 --> 00:55:47,009
Hi.
What are you doing here?

718
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:49,611
Tris: I just figured
that I had to make it.

719
00:55:49,613 --> 00:55:50,846
Who let you out?

720
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:54,083
I did.

721
00:55:54,085 --> 00:55:55,451
You did?

722
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:03,659
Okay.

723
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:18,607
Christina: Let's sit you down.

724
00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:20,776
The game's simple.
It's like capture the flag.

725
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:24,012
Weapon of choice.

726
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:26,382
You call that a gun?

727
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:29,952
(Groaning)

728
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,794
Neuro-stim dart.

729
00:56:38,796 --> 00:56:41,430
Simulates the pain of
a real gunshot wound.

730
00:56:41,432 --> 00:56:43,465
Only lasts a couple minutes.

731
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:45,901
Two teams.
Four and I are captains.

732
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:47,736
You pick first.

733
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:49,972
Okay. Edward.

734
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:53,942
I'll take the stiff.

735
00:56:53,944 --> 00:56:55,778
Oh. Picking the weak ones

736
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,513
so you've got someone
to blame when you lose.

737
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:00,149
Something like that.

738
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:11,560
Christina:
Where did Eric's team go?

739
00:57:11,562 --> 00:57:13,061
Will: They must have
gone to the end.

740
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,001
All right. Lights off.

741
00:57:19,003 --> 00:57:20,068
Gather around. Come on.

742
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:22,971
Okay. What's your strategy?

743
00:57:22,973 --> 00:57:25,441
We can hide the flag
well enough so
they can't find it.

744
00:57:25,443 --> 00:57:27,109
Let's send out a team
to scout their location.
See if we can find their flag.

745
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:28,744
I say we blitz them.
Just beat them
with sheer force.

746
00:57:28,746 --> 00:57:29,945
Al: Yeah, that's the best
way to lose quickly.

747
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,447
Boy: Let's make them
come to us.

748
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:32,714
Ezra: End this quickly,
they won't expect it.

749
00:57:32,716 --> 00:57:34,583
Will: We don't know
where they are.

750
00:57:34,585 --> 00:57:35,584
Okay,
we split into two groups,
defense and offense.

751
00:57:35,586 --> 00:57:36,952
Ezra: Who put you in charge?

752
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:38,220
Christina: Someone has to
make a decision.

753
00:57:38,222 --> 00:57:39,688
Ezra: We need to be
more aggressive.

754
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:40,689
Will: We need
to be smart about it.

755
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:42,024
(Arguing continues)

756
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,035
You're not
gonna jump, are you?

757
00:57:53,037 --> 00:57:55,904
No, I'm just trying to get
a good vantage point.

758
00:57:57,841 --> 00:57:59,241
Good thinking.

759
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:03,946
You don't have
to come with me.

760
00:58:03,948 --> 00:58:06,014
You should go easy.
You took a beating.

761
00:58:06,016 --> 00:58:07,983
I'm surprised you noticed.

762
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,651
I saw you leave
during the fight.

763
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:11,186
Yeah, well, it's not something
I wanted to watch.

764
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:21,663
Four: Hey!

765
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:30,038
You good?

766
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:33,575
You okay?

767
00:58:33,577 --> 00:58:34,910
Yeah. I'm fine.

768
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:37,513
(Grunting)

769
00:58:40,116 --> 00:58:42,017
This is high enough.

770
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:45,153
No, we need to go higher.

771
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:51,159
You all right?

772
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:56,965
You're afraid of heights.

773
00:58:56,967 --> 00:58:59,101
Everyone's
afraid of something.

774
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:02,104
I didn't think you
were afraid of anything.

775
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:14,816
Four: Come on, tris.

776
00:59:14,818 --> 00:59:16,051
(Grunting)

777
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:20,088
Really?

778
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:25,327
Are you even human?

779
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:33,101
(Panting)

780
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:43,011
This isn't so bad.

781
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:48,050
Good eye.

782
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:53,355
Look!

783
00:59:53,357 --> 00:59:54,823
(Chuckles)
There it is.

784
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:57,960
Four: All right.
What's your plan?

785
00:59:57,962 --> 00:59:59,928
Tris: We split
into two groups.

786
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:02,197
We'll go up this side
and let the rest
of you engage Eric.

787
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,276
Boy 1: I can see 'em.
Boy 2: Go! Go!

788
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:17,879
Light 'em up!

789
01:00:17,881 --> 01:00:18,880
(Groaning)

790
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,751
Boy: There's two more!
I'm gonna move in closer!

791
01:00:22,753 --> 01:00:24,119
Follow me. Go!

792
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:25,354
(Boy and girl groaning)

793
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,957
Boy: Watch on your right!
Girl: Go, go, go.

794
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,827
Go.

795
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:32,861
Christina, let's go!

796
01:00:32,863 --> 01:00:34,196
Boy: Get 'em, get 'em!

797
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,770
(Boy groans)
Girl: This way!

798
01:00:41,772 --> 01:00:42,838
Girl: Cover me!
Boy: All right.

799
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:45,340
(Boy groans)

800
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:51,747
(Gasps)

801
01:00:51,749 --> 01:00:52,981
Tell me if this hurts.

802
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:54,950
Tris: You tell me.

803
01:00:54,952 --> 01:00:56,418
(Groans) You bitch!

804
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,087
Christina: Asshole.
(Groans)

805
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:02,991
That was awesome!
(Tris chuckles)

806
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:05,093
(Boy groans)

807
01:01:05,095 --> 01:01:06,194
Girl: Get covered!

808
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:10,032
(Boy groaning)

809
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:22,678
(Groaning)

810
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:29,751
(Grunts)

811
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:34,890
Christina: Go, tris!
I'll guard.

812
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:42,064
(Grunting)

813
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,035
(Yells)

814
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:48,270
(Grunts)

815
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:53,241
(Groans)

816
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:57,879
Whoo!

817
01:01:57,881 --> 01:01:59,247
(All cheering)

818
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,987
Will: Game over!

819
01:02:05,989 --> 01:02:07,456
Al: Good job, tris!

820
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:11,393
(Indistinct conversations)

821
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:14,296
Hey, tris!

822
01:02:14,298 --> 01:02:15,430
Yeah?

823
01:02:15,432 --> 01:02:16,865
Come with us.

824
01:02:16,867 --> 01:02:18,166
Where you going?

825
01:02:18,168 --> 01:02:19,768
Shortcut back.

826
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:23,905
A little initiation ritual,
dauntless style.

827
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:25,340
(Excited indistinct
conversations)

828
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:42,324
(Panting)

829
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:49,131
Tris: Wow.

830
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:07,282
Boy: All right, let's do this!

831
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:08,483
Boy 2: Good.
Boy 1: All right, you good?

832
01:03:08,485 --> 01:03:09,985
Boy: Hang tight.
Girl: Yeah. Go, go!

833
01:03:09,987 --> 01:03:11,353
Fly, baby.
Whoo!

834
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:16,124
You're up.

835
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,161
Boy: All right, do it!

836
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:21,797
(Sighs)
Come on, girl.

837
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,401
Go for it! Do it, tris!

838
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:30,338
Girl: Like flying!

839
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:34,042
Don't forget to pull
the brake at the bottom!

840
01:03:34,044 --> 01:03:35,343
Tris: Okay.

841
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:38,814
Boy: Go.

842
01:03:38,816 --> 01:03:39,881
Boy 1: You ready?

843
01:03:39,883 --> 01:03:41,116
Boy 2: Harness is good.

844
01:03:41,118 --> 01:03:42,484
(Screaming)

845
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,286
(Screaming)

846
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:35,136
(Groans)

847
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,045
Pull the brake!
Pull the brake!

848
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:00,462
(Breathing heavily)

849
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,333
(All cheering)

850
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:06,968
Yeah!

851
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,906
(Indistinct conversations)

852
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:18,513
Four: Tris!

853
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:26,388
Hey.
Hey.

854
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:28,456
Congratulations.

855
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:32,027
Thanks.

856
01:05:32,029 --> 01:05:35,063
You know, I wanted to say
that you were
really good tonight.

857
01:05:35,065 --> 01:05:36,598
You were brave.

858
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:40,402
Yeah.

859
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:45,073
Anyway, you should
get back to your friends.

860
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:49,044
Okay.

861
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,291
If you're ranked
above the red line,

862
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:05,627
you'll move on to
the second stage of training.

863
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:07,329
If you're below it,

864
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:08,596
we'll waste no
more time on you.

865
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:12,367
Here are your rankings.

866
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:16,304
(All cheering)

867
01:06:21,277 --> 01:06:22,410
Will: Nice.
(Chuckling)

868
01:06:25,247 --> 01:06:26,448
Al: You made it.

869
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:27,582
Christina: You made it, tris.

870
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:35,523
Boy 1: Got it.
Boy 2: Thank you.

871
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:40,228
(Indistinct talking)

872
01:06:50,773 --> 01:06:53,375
Here you go.

873
01:06:53,377 --> 01:06:56,277
So we pass
the first stage of training,
and this is our reward.

874
01:06:56,279 --> 01:06:57,345
Man: Toss it up!

875
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:58,546
Glamorous.

876
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:17,032
(Truck engine starts)

877
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,054
(Gasps)

878
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:42,690
Mom?

879
01:07:42,692 --> 01:07:43,792
(Sighs)

880
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:47,629
Oh, my girl!

881
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:51,466
Mom, what are you doing here?

882
01:07:51,468 --> 01:07:53,334
I knew they'd assign
you here sooner or later.

883
01:07:53,336 --> 01:07:55,570
Look at you!
God, you're so
strong and beautiful.

884
01:07:57,473 --> 01:07:58,706
Mom, you can't be here.

885
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:00,275
I know, but you're in danger.

886
01:08:00,277 --> 01:08:01,509
What?

887
01:08:01,511 --> 01:08:04,079
I had to ask you something.

888
01:08:04,081 --> 01:08:05,747
You weren't sick the day
you took your
aptitude test, were you?

889
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:08,450
Why?

890
01:08:08,452 --> 01:08:09,451
What were your test results?

891
01:08:11,454 --> 01:08:13,154
(Whispering) Honey, it's okay.
You can tell me.

892
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:21,262
They were...
They were inconclusive.

893
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:25,266
Divergent?

894
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:27,102
You can't tell anyone.
You can't tell your friends,

895
01:08:27,104 --> 01:08:29,170
your instructors.
You can't trust anyone.

896
01:08:29,172 --> 01:08:30,872
(Pa system whining)
I'm not.

897
01:08:30,874 --> 01:08:34,209
People have always been
so threatened by divergents.

898
01:08:34,211 --> 01:08:35,643
But now erudite
is looking for
them everywhere.

899
01:08:35,645 --> 01:08:36,644
They're actively
seeking them out.

900
01:08:36,646 --> 01:08:38,213
Why?

901
01:08:38,215 --> 01:08:40,248
(Whispering)
Mom, what am I?

902
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,450
You don't conform.
Your mind works in
a million different ways.

903
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:45,253
They're scared of you.

904
01:08:45,255 --> 01:08:48,289
Stage two of training
is where you are most at risk.

905
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:49,524
They're gonna get
inside your head

906
01:08:49,526 --> 01:08:51,392
and watch how you
respond to fear.

907
01:08:51,394 --> 01:08:53,228
But you can pass.
You can make it
through dauntless.

908
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:55,396
I have seen it before.

909
01:08:55,398 --> 01:08:57,899
How do you know
so much about this?
About dauntless?

910
01:08:57,901 --> 01:09:00,502
Never mind about me.
Do not let them
know who you are.

911
01:09:00,504 --> 01:09:02,237
Wait!
Wait! Were you dauntless?

912
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:03,438
Listen.
Guard: Hey!

913
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:07,142
What are you doing?

914
01:09:11,847 --> 01:09:13,681
Truck's loaded. Let's go.

915
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:30,865
(Groaning)

916
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:35,870
What did they do to her?

917
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:38,740
Tris.

918
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:51,953
Take a seat.

919
01:09:56,759 --> 01:09:58,660
I'm going to inject you
with a serum that stimulates

920
01:09:58,662 --> 01:10:00,728
the part of your
brain that processes fear.

921
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:02,530
Great.

922
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:04,732
It induces a hallucination,

923
01:10:04,734 --> 01:10:06,301
and then
transmitters in the serum

924
01:10:06,303 --> 01:10:07,602
allow me to see
the images in your mind.

925
01:10:07,604 --> 01:10:08,803
You can see inside my mind?

926
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:10,872
Mmm-hmm.

927
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:16,344
Lay back.

928
01:10:26,755 --> 01:10:27,889
(Groans)

929
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:34,362
(Sighs)

930
01:10:34,364 --> 01:10:37,332
Now, you're gonna be facing
your worst fears, tris.

931
01:10:37,334 --> 01:10:39,867
Most people have 10
to 15 really bad ones.

932
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:43,371
You have to calm yourself.

933
01:10:43,373 --> 01:10:44,839
Slow your heart rate
and your breathing,

934
01:10:44,841 --> 01:10:46,274
and deal with
what's in front of you.

935
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:52,780
Be brave.

936
01:10:52,782 --> 01:10:54,449
(Breathing heavily)

937
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:05,994
(Thunder rumbling)

938
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:22,377
(Crows cawing)

939
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:31,519
(Panting)

940
01:11:32,554 --> 01:11:33,821
(Squelching)

941
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,461
(Grunting)

942
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:45,967
(Cawing continues)

943
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:48,303
(Groaning)

944
01:12:08,557 --> 01:12:10,024
This isn't real.

945
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:20,034
(Muffled groaning)

946
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:24,939
(Gasps)

947
01:12:24,941 --> 01:12:26,941
It's all right,
it's all right.

948
01:12:26,943 --> 01:12:28,509
You okay?
(Gasping)

949
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:29,577
(Sighing)

950
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:47,795
How long do you think
you were in the hallucination,
tris?

951
01:12:47,797 --> 01:12:50,865
Twenty minutes?
Three.

952
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:53,401
Four times faster
than the average.

953
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:58,673
I've never seen anyone
do that well the first time.

954
01:12:58,675 --> 01:13:00,541
How did you get
rid of the birds?

955
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:02,009
The image wasn't clear.

956
01:13:02,011 --> 01:13:03,711
Um...

957
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:05,413
I just went into the water.

958
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:11,152
Well, next time
it'll be a lot easier.

959
01:13:11,154 --> 01:13:13,121
I have to do that again?

960
01:13:13,123 --> 01:13:14,789
Yeah, you have to practice
several times
before the final,

961
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:15,990
but you're a natural.

962
01:13:15,992 --> 01:13:17,892
You got nothing
to worry about.

963
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:23,531
Christina: My whole body
was covered in
these little insects.

964
01:13:23,533 --> 01:13:25,933
They were in my ears,
and my throat...

965
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:28,736
I couldn't breathe.

966
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:31,639
Yeah, I heard about this guy,
like two years ago...

967
01:13:31,641 --> 01:13:33,107
So panicked he had
a heart attack in his chair

968
01:13:33,109 --> 01:13:35,076
and he almost died.
What?

969
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:36,711
Yeah, so we've got that
to look forward to, right?

970
01:13:36,713 --> 01:13:38,012
(All chuckling)

971
01:13:38,014 --> 01:13:39,614
You didn't seem to
have any problem at all.

972
01:13:39,616 --> 01:13:43,418
Me? No, no, my God,
it was awful.

973
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,520
Oh, come on.
No one even came
close to your time.

974
01:13:45,522 --> 01:13:47,121
You were amazing.
Yeah, what's amazing is that

975
01:13:47,123 --> 01:13:48,556
she's gonna knock
you right out of dauntless.

976
01:13:48,558 --> 01:13:50,191
She's not gonna knock
me out of dauntless.

977
01:13:50,193 --> 01:13:52,593
Look, she's gone from being
the worst to one of the best.

978
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:54,662
Somebody's gotta take
her place at the bottom.

979
01:13:54,664 --> 01:13:57,064
Who's it gonna be? You.

980
01:13:57,066 --> 01:13:58,633
Do you ever stop talking?

981
01:13:58,635 --> 01:14:00,735
I just want to
know how she does it.

982
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:02,837
What's your trick?

983
01:14:02,839 --> 01:14:04,605
I don't have a trick.

984
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:05,940
Nobody gets
through it that fast.

985
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:06,941
Why don't you tell
us how you do it?

986
01:14:09,878 --> 01:14:11,579
At least tell your friends.

987
01:14:12,981 --> 01:14:15,483
What's he talkin' about?

988
01:14:15,485 --> 01:14:16,684
Is there some way
to make it easier?

989
01:14:16,686 --> 01:14:17,718
No.

990
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:24,025
No, I... (Stammers)
I'm not doing anything.

991
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:28,830
(Panting)

992
01:14:28,832 --> 01:14:30,465
(Indistinct conversations)

993
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:34,969
(Groans)

994
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:42,643
(Whispering indistinctly)

995
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:43,644
(Laughing)

996
01:14:52,921 --> 01:14:55,156
Hey! Hey!

997
01:14:56,725 --> 01:14:58,125
(Panting)

998
01:15:03,532 --> 01:15:04,765
(Grunts)

999
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:09,237
(Breathing heavily)

1000
01:15:14,877 --> 01:15:16,143
(Gasping)

1001
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:30,758
This isn't real.

1002
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:47,041
(Gasps)

1003
01:15:49,011 --> 01:15:50,144
(Sighs)

1004
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:53,047
How'd you do that?

1005
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:55,182
What?

1006
01:15:57,019 --> 01:15:58,920
How'd you break the glass?

1007
01:15:58,922 --> 01:16:00,688
(Sighs)

1008
01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:02,323
I don't know. Just did it.

1009
01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:04,992
You just did it?

1010
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:11,032
(Beeping)

1011
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:18,773
What were your test results?

1012
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:21,242
Your aptitude test.

1013
01:16:22,978 --> 01:16:24,178
Abnegation.

1014
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:26,847
I don't think so.

1015
01:16:26,849 --> 01:16:27,949
What?

1016
01:16:28,951 --> 01:16:30,084
I think you're lying to me.

1017
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:33,988
Why would I lie to you?

1018
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:39,627
I'm gonna ask
you one more time.

1019
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:42,763
What were your test results?

1020
01:16:46,034 --> 01:16:47,168
Abnegation.

1021
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:51,872
Time for you to go.

1022
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,313
Tris?

1023
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:02,817
Just so you know,

1024
01:17:02,819 --> 01:17:05,386
dauntless don't break
the glass like that.

1025
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:13,661
Tori: My brother was like you.

1026
01:17:13,663 --> 01:17:16,297
During the second stage,
he got good really fast.

1027
01:17:16,299 --> 01:17:17,999
Last day of the simulations,

1028
01:17:18,001 --> 01:17:20,968
one of the dauntless leaders
came to watch him.

1029
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:24,071
Then the next morning,
we found his body

1030
01:17:24,073 --> 01:17:26,040
at the bottom of the chasm.

1031
01:17:26,042 --> 01:17:27,642
They got rid of him.

1032
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:29,844
Who did?

1033
01:17:29,846 --> 01:17:31,145
Dauntless leadership.

1034
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:32,647
You can't let them
find out about you.

1035
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:36,984
And what if they already know?

1036
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:39,320
Then you're already dead.

1037
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:14,422
Beatrice.

1038
01:18:22,297 --> 01:18:24,465
What are you doing here?

1039
01:18:24,467 --> 01:18:25,700
Tris: I'm in trouble.

1040
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:32,440
What happened?

1041
01:18:32,442 --> 01:18:34,108
I'm not gonna
make it at dauntless.

1042
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:36,310
I don't fit in there.

1043
01:18:36,312 --> 01:18:37,311
You have to fit in there.

1044
01:18:37,313 --> 01:18:38,379
I can't.

1045
01:18:43,985 --> 01:18:46,454
(Stammering) I'm just...
I'm not like them.

1046
01:18:46,456 --> 01:18:48,989
(Chuckles) I mean, who is?
They're crazy.

1047
01:18:51,259 --> 01:18:53,227
Maybe I can go
back to abnegation.

1048
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:55,029
You can't go back.
I know, but...

1049
01:18:55,031 --> 01:18:58,065
They're never
gonna let you do that.
(Sighs)

1050
01:18:58,067 --> 01:19:00,034
Who?
Erudite.

1051
01:19:00,036 --> 01:19:02,069
They're not
gonna let abnegation
break any more rules.

1052
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:04,472
(Scoffs)

1053
01:19:04,474 --> 01:19:05,940
They actually think that
they're running
the government now?

1054
01:19:05,942 --> 01:19:07,108
They might be soon.

1055
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:10,010
Wait. Really?

1056
01:19:10,012 --> 01:19:12,880
Erudite should be in charge.
Certainly not abnegation.

1057
01:19:12,882 --> 01:19:16,050
Wait, hold on, Caleb.
How can you say that?

1058
01:19:16,052 --> 01:19:19,153
It's what all
the other factions want,
now that abnegation failed.

1059
01:19:19,155 --> 01:19:22,022
No. That's just what
they're telling you here...

1060
01:19:22,024 --> 01:19:23,924
It's true.
It's not true.

1061
01:19:23,926 --> 01:19:25,259
(Man shushes)
(Quietly) It's not.

1062
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:26,927
There are liars here.

1063
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:28,996
There are people who know
how to manipulate you.

1064
01:19:28,998 --> 01:19:30,164
You need to understand that.

1065
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:31,465
Beatrice.

1066
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:35,536
I think you should go.

1067
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:42,409
Faction before blood. Yeah?

1068
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:49,049
Got it.

1069
01:19:56,358 --> 01:19:58,459
I need you to come with me.

1070
01:20:00,262 --> 01:20:01,495
(Grunts)
Jeannie: Stop!

1071
01:20:03,331 --> 01:20:04,799
Are you all right?

1072
01:20:06,168 --> 01:20:07,568
Yeah, I'm fine.

1073
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:24,952
Please, sit down.

1074
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:32,059
Thank you.

1075
01:20:32,061 --> 01:20:33,894
I'm glad you came here today.

1076
01:20:33,896 --> 01:20:35,162
You are?

1077
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:36,597
Are you happy with
your new faction?

1078
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:39,500
Yeah.

1079
01:20:39,502 --> 01:20:42,269
But you came to
see your brother.

1080
01:20:42,271 --> 01:20:44,305
I just...
I just wanted to talk to him.

1081
01:20:44,307 --> 01:20:46,907
Have you seen your parents?

1082
01:20:46,909 --> 01:20:47,908
No.

1083
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:52,847
It's hard to let go.
(Cup clatters)

1084
01:20:54,282 --> 01:20:56,317
Faction before blood.

1085
01:20:56,319 --> 01:20:58,118
It's an important ideal,

1086
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:00,020
but sometimes
difficult to fulfill.

1087
01:21:00,022 --> 01:21:03,324
It goes against our
fundamental human nature.

1088
01:21:03,326 --> 01:21:05,159
But that's
exactly the weakness

1089
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:07,528
we need to overcome.

1090
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:10,297
You think that human
nature is a weakness?

1091
01:21:10,299 --> 01:21:14,168
I think human
nature is the enemy.

1092
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:16,470
It's human nature to
keep secrets, lie, steal.

1093
01:21:17,472 --> 01:21:19,640
And I wanna eradicate that.

1094
01:21:19,642 --> 01:21:23,477
That's how we'll maintain
a stable, peaceful society.

1095
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,048
You would help me
with that, wouldn't you?

1096
01:21:29,651 --> 01:21:32,286
How would I help you?

1097
01:21:32,288 --> 01:21:34,154
You're aware
that abnegation
is undermining

1098
01:21:34,156 --> 01:21:36,457
the faction system
and breaking laws

1099
01:21:36,459 --> 01:21:38,492
harboring divergents?

1100
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:45,165
I didn't know that.
(Clears throat)

1101
01:21:45,167 --> 01:21:49,203
But if that's true,
then I'm glad that I left.

1102
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:54,174
See, I need to know
that I can count on you

1103
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:56,277
to enforce the law,

1104
01:21:56,279 --> 01:21:59,013
even if it's been broken
by someone close to you.

1105
01:21:59,015 --> 01:22:00,514
Someone you care about.

1106
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:03,651
Of course.

1107
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:10,691
Then I'll have my car
take you back to dauntless.

1108
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:32,279
(Door opens)

1109
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:34,548
(Door closes)

1110
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:35,716
(Muffled screaming)

1111
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:40,587
(Grunting)

1112
01:22:56,538 --> 01:22:58,205
Man: Come on! Get her over!

1113
01:23:01,076 --> 01:23:03,177
Come on, do it! Do it!

1114
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:04,545
Four: Hey!

1115
01:23:04,547 --> 01:23:06,046
(Grunts)
(Groans)

1116
01:23:24,099 --> 01:23:25,132
(Men groaning)

1117
01:23:26,534 --> 01:23:27,601
You all right?

1118
01:23:28,603 --> 01:23:30,004
Yeah.

1119
01:23:30,006 --> 01:23:31,005
Come on. Let's go.

1120
01:23:44,152 --> 01:23:45,452
Here, put this on.

1121
01:23:46,454 --> 01:23:48,255
Thank you.

1122
01:23:48,257 --> 01:23:49,256
You'll be safe here.

1123
01:23:50,592 --> 01:23:51,658
(Sighs)

1124
01:23:54,429 --> 01:23:55,629
(Basin clatters)

1125
01:23:59,134 --> 01:24:00,200
(Gasps)

1126
01:24:03,338 --> 01:24:04,471
Sorry.

1127
01:24:04,473 --> 01:24:05,539
It's okay.

1128
01:24:12,447 --> 01:24:14,314
I can't believe Al...

1129
01:24:14,316 --> 01:24:18,285
You're moving up
through the ranks,
and he's failing.

1130
01:24:18,287 --> 01:24:21,221
It makes him hate himself
and it makes him hate you.

1131
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:24,358
He's just afraid.

1132
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,326
Everyone's afraid.

1133
01:24:26,328 --> 01:24:29,763
I know, but fear does
something strange
to people like Al.

1134
01:24:29,765 --> 01:24:31,265
But not you.

1135
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:35,636
Fear doesn't shut you down,
it wakes you up.

1136
01:24:37,205 --> 01:24:38,272
I've seen it.

1137
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:53,720
You should lie down.

1138
01:24:56,157 --> 01:24:57,624
Get some sleep.
Yeah.

1139
01:24:58,626 --> 01:25:00,561
I'll take the floor.

1140
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:26,353
How you feeling?

1141
01:25:26,355 --> 01:25:28,255
Better.

1142
01:25:28,257 --> 01:25:30,124
Good.

1143
01:25:30,126 --> 01:25:31,291
(Tapping)

1144
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:33,760
Where'd you go yesterday?

1145
01:25:35,263 --> 01:25:36,497
To see my brother.

1146
01:25:40,235 --> 01:25:43,137
It's getting a little
boring for you here, is it?

1147
01:25:44,272 --> 01:25:47,508
My brother said that...

1148
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:50,677
He thinks erudite is planning
to overthrow abnegation.

1149
01:25:52,247 --> 01:25:55,449
Do you think
they could do that?

1150
01:25:55,451 --> 01:25:57,851
Yeah, I do.
I think it's possible.

1151
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:01,221
Depends how far
they're willing to go.

1152
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:05,526
I'm worried about my parents.

1153
01:26:09,464 --> 01:26:10,797
Yeah.

1154
01:26:12,734 --> 01:26:15,569
But I think you
got other things
you need to worry about.

1155
01:26:16,571 --> 01:26:17,738
Don't you?

1156
01:26:19,574 --> 01:26:20,741
Yeah.

1157
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:27,514
I should go.

1158
01:26:29,284 --> 01:26:30,551
(Footsteps recede)

1159
01:26:33,955 --> 01:26:35,856
(Indistinct conversations)

1160
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:41,828
Christina: Hi.

1161
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:43,830
Hey.

1162
01:26:44,832 --> 01:26:46,200
Is that your sweater?

1163
01:26:46,202 --> 01:26:48,202
No.

1164
01:26:48,204 --> 01:26:49,603
So what happened
to you last night?

1165
01:26:49,605 --> 01:26:51,805
Al: Tris, can I talk
to you for a second?

1166
01:26:51,807 --> 01:26:54,541
Listen, I just wanted
to say that I'm sorry.

1167
01:26:54,543 --> 01:26:57,244
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

1168
01:26:57,246 --> 01:26:58,845
Please,
can you ever forgive me?

1169
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:03,850
If you ever come
close to me again,
I will kill you.

1170
01:27:03,852 --> 01:27:04,952
Tris...

1171
01:27:04,954 --> 01:27:07,588
You need to stay away from me!

1172
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:09,323
You are a coward.

1173
01:27:22,503 --> 01:27:24,605
I just can't
believe he would do that.

1174
01:27:24,607 --> 01:27:26,373
It's not like him at all.

1175
01:27:28,009 --> 01:27:29,443
Will: What's that?

1176
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:33,780
Boy 1: Come on.

1177
01:27:33,782 --> 01:27:34,915
(All grunting)

1178
01:27:37,819 --> 01:27:39,353
(Gasps)
Oh, my God!

1179
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:42,322
Boy 2:
Guess he just jumped.

1180
01:27:42,324 --> 01:27:43,590
(Gasps)

1181
01:27:58,006 --> 01:27:59,273
Tris.

1182
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:01,508
Tris!

1183
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:03,710
Leave me alone.

1184
01:28:03,712 --> 01:28:04,978
I'm sorry about Al.

1185
01:28:06,581 --> 01:28:08,382
It's my fault that he's dead.

1186
01:28:08,384 --> 01:28:11,551
No, it's not because of you.
He made his own choice.

1187
01:28:11,553 --> 01:28:13,320
He would have
been factionless.

1188
01:28:13,322 --> 01:28:14,688
He was not gonna
pass that final test.

1189
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:16,957
Tris:
Neither am I.

1190
01:28:20,695 --> 01:28:22,329
Why do you say that?

1191
01:28:27,735 --> 01:28:29,036
You know why.

1192
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:35,942
And as soon as all
the others find out,
they're gonna kill me.

1193
01:28:35,944 --> 01:28:37,778
I'm not gonna
let that happen.

1194
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:49,323
Shut the door.

1195
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:53,393
You're gonna practice.

1196
01:28:53,395 --> 01:28:55,362
In my fear landscape?
No.

1197
01:28:55,364 --> 01:28:56,530
In mine.

1198
01:28:59,934 --> 01:29:01,435
Have you ever
done this before?

1199
01:29:03,604 --> 01:29:04,971
No, I haven't.

1200
01:29:07,942 --> 01:29:09,643
You sure you want to?

1201
01:29:10,678 --> 01:29:11,745
Why wouldn't I?

1202
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:15,482
I don't know.

1203
01:29:15,484 --> 01:29:17,117
You haven't told me
anything about yourself

1204
01:29:17,119 --> 01:29:18,685
and now you're just gonna
let me inside of your head?

1205
01:29:19,754 --> 01:29:21,388
Are you afraid of that?

1206
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:22,723
You're not?

1207
01:29:24,525 --> 01:29:25,659
No.

1208
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:06,800
(Panting)

1209
01:30:06,802 --> 01:30:09,002
Fear of heights.

1210
01:30:09,004 --> 01:30:10,670
I'm not surprised.

1211
01:30:15,643 --> 01:30:17,477
It's not real.

1212
01:30:17,479 --> 01:30:19,413
No.
We could just jump.

1213
01:30:19,415 --> 01:30:21,047
Divergent would jump.

1214
01:30:21,049 --> 01:30:23,083
Dauntless would
get to that building.

1215
01:30:23,085 --> 01:30:25,152
If you want to pass,
if you want to
avoid discovery,

1216
01:30:25,154 --> 01:30:28,188
you have to do everything
the way
a dauntless would do it.

1217
01:30:28,190 --> 01:30:31,425
You have to find some tool,
some method to survive.

1218
01:30:53,514 --> 01:30:54,681
(Door closing)

1219
01:30:55,683 --> 01:30:56,883
(Four groans)

1220
01:31:01,155 --> 01:31:03,490
Fear of confinement.

1221
01:31:03,492 --> 01:31:04,825
You have to find
a way of stopping it.

1222
01:31:04,827 --> 01:31:06,226
What would a dauntless do?

1223
01:31:07,628 --> 01:31:08,695
Good!

1224
01:31:15,203 --> 01:31:17,904
(Grunts)
Take your time.

1225
01:31:17,906 --> 01:31:19,639
I'm just enjoying myself
in this shrinking box.

1226
01:31:26,214 --> 01:31:27,747
(Panting)

1227
01:31:36,224 --> 01:31:37,958
As a dauntless soldier,
you have to follow orders

1228
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:39,726
you don't always agree with.

1229
01:31:42,930 --> 01:31:44,130
Who is she?

1230
01:31:47,735 --> 01:31:49,236
She's an innocent.

1231
01:31:52,073 --> 01:31:53,840
I have to kill her.

1232
01:32:01,883 --> 01:32:03,617
But I can never do it.

1233
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:06,953
Unless I look away.

1234
01:32:13,928 --> 01:32:14,995
(Gunshot)

1235
01:32:16,797 --> 01:32:18,999
(Four breathing heavily)

1236
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,574
Why are we in abnegation?

1237
01:32:30,144 --> 01:32:32,245
Your last fear is
your worst fear.

1238
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:36,850
It lives in
the deepest part of your mind.

1239
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:47,327
Marcus had a son.

1240
01:32:48,896 --> 01:32:49,930
What was his name?

1241
01:32:49,932 --> 01:32:51,865
Tobias.

1242
01:32:51,867 --> 01:32:53,199
Marcus: Tobias.

1243
01:32:56,871 --> 01:32:58,271
<i> Tobias...</i>

1244
01:32:59,907 --> 01:33:01,675
(Echoing)<i> Tobias...</i>

1245
01:33:04,879 --> 01:33:06,680
<i> Tobias...</i>

1246
01:33:06,682 --> 01:33:08,949
I'm just trying to
help you to be better.

1247
01:33:12,286 --> 01:33:13,353
Tris: No!

1248
01:33:16,223 --> 01:33:17,223
(Gasps)

1249
01:33:20,928 --> 01:33:22,796
(Panting)

1250
01:33:31,839 --> 01:33:33,006
(Sighs)

1251
01:33:39,113 --> 01:33:41,181
Four?

1252
01:33:41,183 --> 01:33:42,949
Four fears?

1253
01:33:42,951 --> 01:33:44,751
Four then, four now.

1254
01:33:47,088 --> 01:33:50,256
I keep going in there,
but I don't think
you ever lose them.

1255
01:34:01,936 --> 01:34:03,370
Can I ask you something?

1256
01:34:04,372 --> 01:34:06,206
Sure.

1257
01:34:06,208 --> 01:34:08,008
What's your tattoo?

1258
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:14,347
You wanna see it?

1259
01:34:30,031 --> 01:34:31,364
It's amazing.

1260
01:34:43,978 --> 01:34:45,745
Tris: The factions.

1261
01:34:50,117 --> 01:34:52,952
Why do you have all of them?

1262
01:34:52,954 --> 01:34:54,888
I don't want to
be just one thing.

1263
01:34:55,890 --> 01:34:57,123
I can't be.

1264
01:34:58,759 --> 01:35:02,796
I want to be brave and
I want to be selfless...

1265
01:35:02,798 --> 01:35:04,831
Intelligent and
honest and kind.

1266
01:35:07,968 --> 01:35:10,236
Although I'm still
working on "kind."

1267
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:45,004
I don't wanna go too fast.

1268
01:35:47,241 --> 01:35:48,441
It's okay.

1269
01:35:50,411 --> 01:35:52,512
I've already got my
spot on the floor.

1270
01:35:52,514 --> 01:35:53,513
(Chuckles)

1271
01:36:11,799 --> 01:36:12,966
Tris: Morning.

1272
01:36:12,968 --> 01:36:14,167
Hey.

1273
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:16,803
Come on.
I'm gonna show you something.

1274
01:36:18,839 --> 01:36:20,206
Okay.

1275
01:36:34,488 --> 01:36:36,189
Look.

1276
01:36:41,162 --> 01:36:43,229
Erudite.
Yeah.

1277
01:36:43,231 --> 01:36:45,331
They're here every morning.

1278
01:36:45,333 --> 01:36:47,133
I've been
watching them for weeks.

1279
01:36:47,135 --> 01:36:49,035
What are they
doing at dauntless?

1280
01:36:49,037 --> 01:36:51,504
Loading in supplies.
Computers.

1281
01:36:53,073 --> 01:36:54,507
And these.

1282
01:36:57,144 --> 01:36:58,812
Tris: What is it?

1283
01:36:58,814 --> 01:37:00,146
I think it's some kind
of cognitive transmitter.

1284
01:37:00,148 --> 01:37:01,347
You inject it like a serum.

1285
01:37:01,349 --> 01:37:03,149
Why?

1286
01:37:03,151 --> 01:37:06,486
It's supposed to make you more
susceptible to suggestion,

1287
01:37:06,488 --> 01:37:10,023
but as many as they have,
they could create an army.

1288
01:37:17,231 --> 01:37:18,898
Man: (On pa)
<i> Attention,</i>

1289
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:21,467
<i> all initiates</i>
<i> report for final testing.</i>

1290
01:37:21,469 --> 01:37:23,937
<i> All initiates</i>
<i> report for final testing.</i>

1291
01:37:31,612 --> 01:37:33,980
You're ready.

1292
01:37:33,982 --> 01:37:35,381
You can do this.

1293
01:37:57,338 --> 01:38:00,874
They can see
your hallucinations
on the screen.

1294
01:38:00,876 --> 01:38:02,976
So you get past your fears
the way a dauntless would,

1295
01:38:02,978 --> 01:38:04,544
but do it quickly.

1296
01:38:04,546 --> 01:38:07,480
Right. If I'm too good,
then they'll kill me,

1297
01:38:07,482 --> 01:38:09,315
and if I'm too slow,
then I'll die.

1298
01:38:09,317 --> 01:38:11,050
Right.

1299
01:38:11,052 --> 01:38:12,485
Good luck.

1300
01:38:21,395 --> 01:38:22,428
Good luck, tris.

1301
01:38:24,198 --> 01:38:25,198
Hope you make it.

1302
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:48,087
(Cawing)

1303
01:38:59,433 --> 01:39:01,134
(Panting)

1304
01:39:47,314 --> 01:39:48,448
(Grunting)

1305
01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:50,416
(Panting)

1306
01:40:27,488 --> 01:40:28,554
Four: Congratulations.

1307
01:40:37,598 --> 01:40:39,732
Whoa. Four!

1308
01:40:42,202 --> 01:40:43,669
Stop! Four!

1309
01:40:43,671 --> 01:40:45,571
Aren't you dauntless?

1310
01:40:49,209 --> 01:40:50,743
(Grunts)

1311
01:40:50,745 --> 01:40:52,578
(Gasps)
(Audience applauds)

1312
01:41:05,359 --> 01:41:07,760
Please tell me that
you weren't watching that.

1313
01:41:07,762 --> 01:41:09,595
Would you feel
better if I said no?

1314
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,200
You did well.

1315
01:41:15,202 --> 01:41:16,269
Now...

1316
01:41:18,172 --> 01:41:19,572
One final test.

1317
01:41:26,647 --> 01:41:28,081
You know what to do.

1318
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:31,284
What?

1319
01:41:31,286 --> 01:41:33,086
If you want to be dauntless.

1320
01:41:33,088 --> 01:41:34,187
No.

1321
01:41:35,189 --> 01:41:36,456
Do it.

1322
01:41:48,569 --> 01:41:49,836
(Gasps)

1323
01:41:49,838 --> 01:41:51,204
(Panting)
Four: You all right?

1324
01:41:55,542 --> 01:41:56,642
That looked good to me, okay?

1325
01:41:58,245 --> 01:42:00,179
Come on. Let's go.

1326
01:42:00,181 --> 01:42:02,415
Congratulations,

1327
01:42:02,417 --> 01:42:03,416
new members of dauntless.

1328
01:42:03,418 --> 01:42:05,718
(All cheering)

1329
01:42:10,290 --> 01:42:12,391
All: (Chanting) Dauntless!
Dauntless! Dauntless!

1330
01:42:12,393 --> 01:42:14,193
(All speaking excitedly)

1331
01:42:16,430 --> 01:42:18,664
Female leader:
Come on. Get in line.

1332
01:42:18,666 --> 01:42:20,600
Male leader:
All right, everybody, line up.

1333
01:42:20,602 --> 01:42:22,135
What's going on?

1334
01:42:22,137 --> 01:42:23,803
Man: (On pa)
<i> All dauntless initiates,</i>

1335
01:42:23,805 --> 01:42:25,171
<i> report to your command leader.</i>

1336
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:27,907
Eric: All right, listen up!

1337
01:42:29,743 --> 01:42:32,678
Before you leave tonight,
I want you all in four lines.

1338
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:35,348
Everyone gets
a tracking device.

1339
01:42:35,350 --> 01:42:37,817
Don't ask questions.
It's just a precaution.

1340
01:42:50,497 --> 01:42:51,764
Do you see four?

1341
01:42:53,634 --> 01:42:54,734
Christina: No.

1342
01:42:54,736 --> 01:42:56,169
Woman: Next!

1343
01:42:56,171 --> 01:42:57,837
Will: What's going on?
Oh, my God.

1344
01:42:59,339 --> 01:43:00,740
Congratulations.

1345
01:43:02,209 --> 01:43:04,644
You should be
first in line, but...

1346
01:43:04,646 --> 01:43:05,845
I'll make it easy for you.

1347
01:43:09,950 --> 01:43:11,817
Eric: Hurts like a bitch, huh?

1348
01:43:12,819 --> 01:43:14,587
Now you're really one of us.

1349
01:43:20,894 --> 01:43:22,495
(Door opening)

1350
01:43:34,875 --> 01:43:36,542
Hey, what's...

1351
01:43:50,991 --> 01:43:52,725
Man: (On pa)
<i> Faction before blood.</i>

1352
01:43:52,727 --> 01:43:53,893
Oh, my God.

1353
01:44:10,344 --> 01:44:11,677
Max: They can see and hear us.

1354
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:14,013
They just don't
process it the same way.

1355
01:44:14,015 --> 01:44:16,849
Commands come in
through the transmitter.

1356
01:44:25,525 --> 01:44:26,659
What's goin' on?

1357
01:44:28,729 --> 01:44:30,496
What are we doin'?

1358
01:44:34,768 --> 01:44:36,602
Divergent.

1359
01:44:41,041 --> 01:44:42,875
Eric: Hey!

1360
01:44:42,877 --> 01:44:44,610
Everything's fine.
There's nothing
to worry about.

1361
01:44:44,612 --> 01:44:45,811
(Gunshot)
(Thudding)

1362
01:46:08,895 --> 01:46:09,929
(Gasps)

1363
01:46:13,934 --> 01:46:15,067
(Sighs)

1364
01:47:11,658 --> 01:47:12,992
(Siren wailing)

1365
01:47:15,695 --> 01:47:17,630
Man: Hurry up! Move!

1366
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:19,532
(Glass shatters)

1367
01:47:19,534 --> 01:47:21,767
(Woman screams)

1368
01:47:21,769 --> 01:47:24,069
Man: (On pa)<i> Abnegation</i>

1369
01:47:24,071 --> 01:47:25,871

1370
01:47:25,873 --> 01:47:27,006
(Arguing indistinctly)

1371
01:47:28,642 --> 01:47:30,810
(Gunshot)
(Woman screams)

1372
01:47:30,812 --> 01:47:33,546
Just keep moving.
Where's your house?

1373
01:47:33,548 --> 01:47:35,915
Man: (On pa)<i> We are looking</i>
<i> for information.</i>

1374
01:47:35,917 --> 01:47:38,517
<i> All houses will be searched.</i>

1375
01:47:38,519 --> 01:47:40,586
<i> Do not resist.</i>
<i> You will not be hurt.</i>

1376
01:47:47,928 --> 01:47:49,528
Tris: Mom? Dad?

1377
01:47:51,765 --> 01:47:53,199
Where would they have gone?

1378
01:47:54,801 --> 01:47:56,101
I don't know.

1379
01:47:59,606 --> 01:48:02,174
Woman: This can't happen here!
Just stop it!

1380
01:48:08,748 --> 01:48:10,015
Man: (On pa)<i> Do not resist.</i>

1381
01:48:14,521 --> 01:48:16,822
<i> All abnegation</i>
<i> will be questioned.</i>

1382
01:48:16,824 --> 01:48:18,090
The legendary four...

1383
01:48:19,092 --> 01:48:21,160
A mindless drone.

1384
01:48:21,162 --> 01:48:23,195
You were first in your class.
Now you're...

1385
01:48:24,598 --> 01:48:25,731
Nothing.

1386
01:48:41,581 --> 01:48:43,682
What?

1387
01:48:43,684 --> 01:48:45,017
Think he might be...

1388
01:48:46,620 --> 01:48:48,754
There's one way to find out.

1389
01:48:50,790 --> 01:48:51,790
Eric: Say goodbye, asshole.

1390
01:48:51,792 --> 01:48:52,925
Goodbye.

1391
01:48:52,927 --> 01:48:54,093
Move and you die!

1392
01:48:55,195 --> 01:48:56,829
The stiff?

1393
01:48:56,831 --> 01:48:58,264
(Chuckling)

1394
01:48:59,533 --> 01:49:01,267
Two stiffs.

1395
01:49:01,269 --> 01:49:03,035
Eric: Two dead stiffs.

1396
01:49:03,037 --> 01:49:06,005
You can't let
a single divergent
slip through.

1397
01:49:06,007 --> 01:49:08,007
This is what happens.

1398
01:49:08,009 --> 01:49:09,742
She's not gonna shoot me.

1399
01:49:09,744 --> 01:49:11,110
Think you might be
overestimating my character.

1400
01:49:12,112 --> 01:49:13,612
(Gunshot)
(Groans)

1401
01:49:14,781 --> 01:49:16,181
Four: Run!

1402
01:49:16,183 --> 01:49:17,850
(Groans)

1403
01:49:17,852 --> 01:49:18,918
(Gunshot)

1404
01:49:22,322 --> 01:49:23,923
You were hit?
Yeah.

1405
01:49:24,925 --> 01:49:27,092
Right there! Don't move!

1406
01:49:27,094 --> 01:49:28,093
Max: Drop your weapons.

1407
01:49:30,330 --> 01:49:32,331
(Man announcing
indistinctly on pa)

1408
01:49:49,015 --> 01:49:50,916
Tobias eaton.

1409
01:49:53,086 --> 01:49:55,287
And you, Beatrice.

1410
01:49:57,223 --> 01:49:59,858
I thought it was intellect
I was sensing in you.

1411
01:49:59,860 --> 01:50:01,060
Maybe you're not as smart
as you think you are.

1412
01:50:02,762 --> 01:50:04,897
Why are you attacking
all these innocent people?

1413
01:50:04,899 --> 01:50:06,765
Innocent people?

1414
01:50:06,767 --> 01:50:10,736
Abnegation, if left
unchecked, will destroy
the faction system.

1415
01:50:10,738 --> 01:50:13,339
Same can be said
of both of you.

1416
01:50:13,341 --> 01:50:15,107
Somebody has to stop you.

1417
01:50:15,109 --> 01:50:17,376
If we don't,
peace will be lost.

1418
01:50:17,378 --> 01:50:20,212
It's already been lost.
You destroyed it.

1419
01:50:20,214 --> 01:50:23,248
Human nature destroyed it.

1420
01:50:23,250 --> 01:50:25,818
Those of us with
the vision to see that

1421
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:28,387
are called upon to
protect the rest.

1422
01:50:28,389 --> 01:50:31,223
We will restore the peace.

1423
01:50:31,225 --> 01:50:33,359
And this time, it will last.

1424
01:50:33,361 --> 01:50:34,994
And what if you're wrong?

1425
01:50:42,235 --> 01:50:43,969
Bring him with us.

1426
01:50:45,672 --> 01:50:47,272
(Groans)

1427
01:50:47,274 --> 01:50:48,641
(Clicks tongue)
She's injured.

1428
01:50:50,076 --> 01:50:51,777
Any results would be unclear.

1429
01:50:53,313 --> 01:50:54,413
You can get rid of her.
Soldier: All right.

1430
01:50:57,684 --> 01:50:58,884
(Groaning)

1431
01:51:00,887 --> 01:51:02,287
Get down!

1432
01:51:05,659 --> 01:51:06,892

1433
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:10,062
Soldier: Let's go.
Come on!

1434
01:51:15,702 --> 01:51:19,071
Man: (On pa)<i> Additional</i>

1437
01:51:57,010 --> 01:51:58,377

1438
01:51:59,379 --> 01:52:01,013
Mom? Mom!
Beatrice.

1439
01:52:02,015 --> 01:52:03,315
Okay.

1440
01:52:09,289 --> 01:52:10,956
Okay, we gotta run!

1441
01:52:22,402 --> 01:52:24,203
You were dauntless.

1442
01:52:25,205 --> 01:52:26,505
Served me well today.

1443
01:52:28,074 --> 01:52:29,775
Is dad okay?

1444
01:52:29,777 --> 01:52:31,777
Yeah. He led a group over
to Monroe and state.

1445
01:52:31,779 --> 01:52:33,078
We're gonna meet him there.

1446
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:34,146

1447
01:52:35,348 --> 01:52:36,381
Let's go!

Soldier: Copy 1-9!

1451
01:53:06,413 --> 01:53:07,412

01:53:11,518 --> 01:53:13,152
Will! Will!

1453
01:53:17,557 --> 01:53:18,957
Will!

1454

Tris: Stop!
(Gunshot)

1456
01:53:25,399 --> 01:53:26,565
I...

1457
01:53:34,808 --> 01:53:37,442
Okay.
Come on, honey.
We gotta go.

1458
01:53:53,026 --> 01:53:55,327
I killed him. I killed him.

1459
01:53:56,329 --> 01:53:58,096
I killed him.

1460
01:53:58,098 --> 01:53:59,131
Come here.

1461
01:54:04,470 --> 01:54:05,838
Okay.

1462

Let's go find your father.

Cover me.
No.

1464

I'll go.

Got it, sir!

Natalie: Don't stop!
Don't stop!

1468
01:54:29,896 --> 01:54:31,430
Go!

1469
01:54:31,432 --> 01:54:32,865

(Groans)

1471
01:54:36,469 --> 01:54:38,003
You okay? Good.
Yeah, I'm good.

1472
01:54:44,477 --> 01:54:46,478
Okay! Let's go! We're good.

1473
01:54:48,014 --> 01:54:49,147
Mom?

1474
01:54:49,149 --> 01:54:50,549
Mom... what is it?

1475
01:54:53,019 --> 01:54:54,186
Hey...

1476
01:54:55,188 --> 01:54:57,890
Mom! Mom! Mom!

1477
01:54:57,892 --> 01:54:59,091
Mom!

1478
01:54:59,093 --> 01:55:01,059
Mom, no!

1479
01:55:01,061 --> 01:55:03,195
Mom! Mom!

1480
01:55:04,998 --> 01:55:06,565
(Sobbing)
Mom? Mom!

1481
01:55:06,567 --> 01:55:08,567
Mom, wake up!

1482
01:55:10,036 --> 01:55:11,236
Mom!

1483
01:55:12,338 --> 01:55:14,273
Oh, my God, mom!

1484
01:55:19,078 --> 01:55:20,145
(Gunshots continue)

1485
01:55:21,681 --> 01:55:23,548
Stop! Stop!

1486
01:55:23,550 --> 01:55:24,616
(Sobbing)

1487
01:55:28,021 --> 01:55:30,155
I love you, mom...

1488
01:55:34,427 --> 01:55:35,961
Oh, my God!

1489
01:55:44,237 --> 01:55:45,637
(Panting)

1490
01:55:57,083 --> 01:55:58,350
(Sobbing)

1491
01:56:33,186 --> 01:56:35,087
Tris: Where's my father?

1492
01:56:35,089 --> 01:56:36,755
Andrew: Beatrice?

1493
01:56:36,757 --> 01:56:38,523
(People whispering
indistinctly)

1494
01:56:43,529 --> 01:56:44,696
Your mother?

1495
01:57:05,752 --> 01:57:07,686
She saved me.
(Sniffles)

1496
01:57:09,022 --> 01:57:10,622
She saved me.

1497
01:57:11,657 --> 01:57:13,492
Then it wasn't in vain.

1498
01:57:15,695 --> 01:57:17,062
We need to leave here.

1499
01:57:18,798 --> 01:57:20,499
Are there soldiers outside?

1500
01:57:25,405 --> 01:57:26,772
No, it's clear.

1501
01:57:28,641 --> 01:57:30,742
I should have believed you.

1502
01:57:30,744 --> 01:57:33,612
I left as soon as I realized.

1503
01:57:33,614 --> 01:57:35,747
Why is this happening?
I don't understand.

1504
01:57:37,550 --> 01:57:39,751
Why are dauntless
fighting for erudite?

1505
01:57:39,753 --> 01:57:41,219
They don't know
what they're doing.

1506
01:57:41,221 --> 01:57:44,289
They're under simulation.

1507
01:57:44,291 --> 01:57:46,658
We need to wake 'em up.
I need to get into dauntless.

1508
01:57:46,660 --> 01:57:47,759
Marcus: That's a fortress.

1509
01:57:48,761 --> 01:57:50,062
It's not gonna happen.

1510
01:57:52,432 --> 01:57:54,399
I can get us in there.

1511
01:58:02,241 --> 01:58:03,475
Tris: Get ready.

1512
01:58:04,477 --> 01:58:06,478
What now?

1513
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:08,246
You're not gonna like it.

1514
01:58:28,768 --> 01:58:30,869
There's a net at the bottom.

1515
01:58:30,871 --> 01:58:32,437
Don't think, just jump.

1516
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:35,674
(Groans)

1517
01:58:41,314 --> 01:58:42,881
(Panting)

1518
01:58:43,883 --> 01:58:45,584
Are you good?

1519
01:58:45,586 --> 01:58:46,818
Good?

1520
01:58:48,588 --> 01:58:50,188
Let's go.

1521
01:58:56,496 --> 01:58:57,829
Wait here.

1522
01:59:05,371 --> 01:59:06,771
Against the wall.

1523
01:59:06,773 --> 01:59:08,406
Against the wall!

1524
01:59:12,378 --> 01:59:13,845
How are you awake?

1525
01:59:13,847 --> 01:59:16,148
Because I'm smarter than you.

1526
01:59:16,150 --> 01:59:17,549
And they need me.

1527
01:59:17,551 --> 01:59:19,584
Where are they
controlling it from?

1528
01:59:19,586 --> 01:59:22,254
Why would I tell you that?
It's not like
you're gonna shoot me.

1529
01:59:22,256 --> 01:59:24,456
Why do people
keep saying that?

1530
01:59:24,458 --> 01:59:25,891
(Gunshot)
(Screams)

1531
01:59:25,893 --> 01:59:27,659
(Groans)

1532
01:59:27,661 --> 01:59:29,361
Where are they
controlling it from?

1533
01:59:36,536 --> 01:59:37,802
Did you really
need to shoot him?

1534
01:59:39,472 --> 01:59:41,773
Every minute we waste,
another abnegation dies

1535
01:59:41,775 --> 01:59:44,209
and another
dauntless becomes a murderer.

1536
01:59:44,211 --> 01:59:45,844
Tris: Peter, let's go.

1537
02:00:01,761 --> 02:00:03,328
That's it, isn't it?

1538
02:00:03,330 --> 02:00:04,663
Yeah.

1539
02:00:04,665 --> 02:00:06,498
I've seen jeanine go in there.

1540
02:00:06,500 --> 02:00:08,300
That's where she's
controlling it from.

1541
02:00:20,646 --> 02:00:23,682
Like you said, there
isn't a second to waste.

1542
02:00:29,388 --> 02:00:30,455
Dad, no!
(Gunshots firing)

1543
02:00:31,958 --> 02:00:33,625
Dad...

1544
02:00:33,627 --> 02:00:34,960
Man: Do whatever it takes...
(Gunfire continues)

1545
02:00:34,962 --> 02:00:36,828
Man: Hey! (Groans)

1546
02:00:36,830 --> 02:00:37,896
(Grunts)

1547
02:01:15,868 --> 02:01:18,470
Watch Caleb.
I'm going in there.

1548
02:01:43,696 --> 02:01:45,530
(People chatting indistinctly)

1549
02:02:10,856 --> 02:02:12,524
Hey. Hi.

1550
02:02:24,370 --> 02:02:25,437
(Grunts)

1551
02:02:27,640 --> 02:02:28,673
Four...

1552
02:02:30,076 --> 02:02:32,877
Four... four,
it's me. You're in a SIM.

1553
02:02:32,879 --> 02:02:34,646
He can't hear you.

1554
02:02:36,615 --> 02:02:38,583
Amazing, isn't it?

1555
02:02:38,585 --> 02:02:41,086
Everything we think of
that makes up a person,

1556
02:02:41,088 --> 02:02:44,489
thoughts, emotions, history...

1557
02:02:44,491 --> 02:02:46,491
All wiped away by chemistry.

1558
02:02:46,493 --> 02:02:47,592
Four.

1559
02:02:47,594 --> 02:02:48,927
He's gone.

1560
02:02:49,929 --> 02:02:51,763
And we're all safer for it.

1561
02:02:51,765 --> 02:02:54,666
Safer? How are we safer?

1562
02:02:54,668 --> 02:02:56,835
The brilliance of
the faction system

1563
02:02:56,837 --> 02:02:59,070
is that conformity to
the faction removes the threat

1564
02:02:59,072 --> 02:03:02,774
of anyone exercising
their independent will.

1565
02:03:02,776 --> 02:03:04,909
Divergents
threaten that system.

1566
02:03:07,780 --> 02:03:10,482
Don't get me wrong.

1567
02:03:10,484 --> 02:03:13,551
There's a certain
beauty in your resistance,

1568
02:03:13,553 --> 02:03:16,154
your defiance of
categorization.

1569
02:03:16,156 --> 02:03:18,423
But it's a beauty
we can't afford.

1570
02:03:31,404 --> 02:03:35,140
Four, it's me. It's me.

1571
02:03:35,142 --> 02:03:36,908
Please, four, look at me.
Look at me.

1572
02:03:37,910 --> 02:03:38,977
(Grunts)

1573
02:03:47,686 --> 02:03:49,154
(Both grunting)

1574
02:03:57,830 --> 02:03:59,164
Four! It's me!

1575
02:04:02,635 --> 02:04:03,968
(Groaning)

1576
02:04:28,627 --> 02:04:29,627
Four, stop!

1577
02:04:30,830 --> 02:04:32,096
Stop!

1578
02:04:33,532 --> 02:04:34,632
Stop...

1579
02:04:36,469 --> 02:04:38,036
Four... please...

1580
02:04:43,876 --> 02:04:46,945
It's okay, it's okay.
I love you. It's okay.

1581
02:04:51,884 --> 02:04:53,084
It's okay.

1582
02:04:54,086 --> 02:04:55,787
I love you. It's okay.

1583
02:05:01,961 --> 02:05:03,127
Four, look at me. Look at me.

1584
02:05:06,499 --> 02:05:09,033
(Whispering)
It's me. It's me.

1585
02:05:09,035 --> 02:05:11,202
It's me. It's me.

1586
02:05:12,705 --> 02:05:14,239
(Panting)

1587
02:05:20,613 --> 02:05:21,613
Tris...

1588
02:05:26,986 --> 02:05:28,086
Go.

1589
02:05:31,757 --> 02:05:32,824
Finish it.

1590
02:05:36,929 --> 02:05:38,062
(Erudites clamoring)

1591
02:05:54,980 --> 02:05:56,314
(Sirens blaring)

1592
02:06:03,322 --> 02:06:04,322
(Groans)

1593
02:06:06,992 --> 02:06:08,326
(Groans)

1594
02:06:09,328 --> 02:06:10,328
Help!

1595
02:06:14,833 --> 02:06:16,034
Man: Hey!

1596
02:06:25,010 --> 02:06:26,878
Shut it down.

1597
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:27,946
No.

1598
02:06:31,016 --> 02:06:32,116
(Gunshots)

1599
02:06:43,028 --> 02:06:44,862
I am not gonna
ask you again. Do it!

1600
02:06:44,864 --> 02:06:46,831
Shut it down!

1601
02:06:46,833 --> 02:06:48,933
I admire you willing to die
for what you believe...

1602
02:06:49,935 --> 02:06:51,202
But so am I.

1603
02:06:54,940 --> 02:06:56,307
You can't do it, can you?

1604
02:07:00,980 --> 02:07:02,647
(Siren wailing)

1605
02:07:14,126 --> 02:07:15,293
(Sobbing)

1606
02:07:31,310 --> 02:07:34,345
Maybe you're not
quite as dauntless
as you thought you were.

1607
02:07:34,347 --> 02:07:36,080
You're right.

1608
02:07:37,783 --> 02:07:39,651
I'm not.

1609
02:07:39,653 --> 02:07:40,885
I'm divergent.

1610
02:07:43,689 --> 02:07:45,089
(Groans)

1611
02:07:51,230 --> 02:07:54,198
Now shut it down
and wipe the program.

1612
02:08:12,951 --> 02:08:14,419
(Panting)

1613
02:08:23,996 --> 02:08:25,697
Woman: (On pa)
<i> Simulation abort.</i>

1614
02:08:25,699 --> 02:08:27,331
(Beeping)
<i> System-wide shutdown.</i>

1615
02:08:36,041 --> 02:08:37,375
Jeanine: No... no...

1616
02:08:40,412 --> 02:08:41,879
No!

1617
02:08:43,749 --> 02:08:44,782
(Grunts)

1618
02:08:49,455 --> 02:08:52,123
Don't get me wrong.

1619
02:08:52,125 --> 02:08:53,725
There's a certain
beauty to your resistance.

1620
02:08:54,827 --> 02:08:56,327
(Grunts angrily)

1621
02:09:02,501 --> 02:09:04,068
Four: Tris...

1622
02:09:04,070 --> 02:09:06,037
Woman: (On pa)
<i> Lockdown now in effect.</i>

1623
02:09:07,039 --> 02:09:08,306
Max: All right, let's move!

1624
02:09:09,908 --> 02:09:11,342
We gotta go. Now.

1625
02:09:17,850 --> 02:09:19,283
Tobias.

1626
02:09:21,386 --> 02:09:23,321
We need to keep moving.

1627
02:09:32,231 --> 02:09:33,431
All right, move!

1628
02:09:48,080 --> 02:09:49,413
Son!

1629
02:09:59,792 --> 02:10:01,259
I got it!

1630
02:10:01,261 --> 02:10:02,393
I know you do.

1631
02:10:18,877 --> 02:10:20,378
Tris: My mom
and dad died today.

1632
02:10:24,416 --> 02:10:26,150
They're gone.

1633
02:10:26,152 --> 02:10:27,919
Four: I know.

1634
02:10:27,921 --> 02:10:29,520
But they loved you, tris.

1635
02:10:32,057 --> 02:10:34,392
For them, there was
no better way to show you.

1636
02:10:34,394 --> 02:10:35,459
(Sniffles)

1637
02:10:40,465 --> 02:10:42,400
Now we have nothing.

1638
02:10:42,402 --> 02:10:44,302
We have no home, no faction...

1639
02:10:50,209 --> 02:10:52,076
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

1640
02:10:58,550 --> 02:11:00,518
I know exactly who you are.

1641
02:11:02,221 --> 02:11:03,554
You sure about that?

1642
02:11:05,424 --> 02:11:07,391
Yeah, I'm very sure.

1643
02:11:11,063 --> 02:11:12,230
Come here.

1644
02:11:25,577 --> 02:11:28,079
Tris:<i> We're like</i>
<i> the factionless now.</i>

1645
02:11:28,081 --> 02:11:31,048
<i> We've left everything behind,</i>

1646
02:11:31,050 --> 02:11:33,618
<i> but we found</i>
<i> ourselves and each other.</i>

1647
02:11:35,988 --> 02:11:39,523
<i> Tomorrow we may</i>
<i> have to fight again,</i>

1648
02:11:39,525 --> 02:11:42,927
<i> but,</i>
<i> for now, we'll ride the train</i>
<i> to the end of the line...</i>

1649
02:11:42,929 --> 02:11:44,428
<i> And then</i>

1650
02:11:44,430 --> 02:11:45,463
<i> we'll jump.</i>
