00:00:25,553 --> 00:00:29,512
"Whoever fights monsters
should see to it that in the process...

2
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:33,972
...he does not become a monster,
and if you gaze long enough into an abyss...

3
00:00:34,055 --> 00:00:37,181
...the abyss will gaze back into you."
Friedrich Nietzsche.

4
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:03,948
<i>We are never very far from those we hate.</i>

5
00:01:05,908 --> 00:01:08,023
<i>For this very reason...</i>

6
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:11,489
<i>...we shall never be truly close
to those we love.</i>

7
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:15,539
<i>An appalling fact.</i>

8
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:18,779
<i>I knew it well enough when I embarked.</i>

9
00:01:19,488 --> 00:01:22,067
<i>But some truths deserve our attention.</i>

10
00:01:23,628 --> 00:01:26,204
<i>Others are best left alone.</i>

11
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:31,404
<i>We set sail 67 days ago.</i>

12
00:01:32,854 --> 00:01:36,010
<i>September, 1914.</i>

13
00:02:02,631 --> 00:02:05,469
Matches are useless...

14
00:02:05,552 --> 00:02:08,273
...as teats on a bull above deck.

15
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,298
Thank you.

16
00:02:19,214 --> 00:02:23,094
There's your island. Look, you see it?

17
00:02:32,426 --> 00:02:34,372
What are you running from?

18
00:02:38,378 --> 00:02:41,739
That was the first question they asked me
when I decided to go to sea.

19
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:46,684
Prepare to weigh anchor!

20
00:03:01,393 --> 00:03:04,605
That is a one man job. Don't need two.

21
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:07,563
Rusky, aren't you listening?
Be careful with those in the back!

22
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,560
Don't get 'em wet!

23
00:03:12,897 --> 00:03:16,864
Careful with that. Don't throw stuff about.

24
00:03:17,885 --> 00:03:19,773
Get that rope in!

25
00:03:20,611 --> 00:03:22,253
Rope!

26
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,944
Come on, come on! Put him on the rope!

27
00:03:43,027 --> 00:03:44,955
Move it!

28
00:03:49,474 --> 00:03:51,580
No birds.

29
00:03:51,872 --> 00:03:54,385
No weather official to greet you, either.

30
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,783
Captain, sir, where we leave the luggage
of officer of air and winds?

31
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:43,768
Here inside.

32
00:04:44,268 --> 00:04:46,644
Tell the others to hold off
with the rest of the provisions.

33
00:04:46,727 --> 00:04:49,239
- No. No, bring it forth.
- With respect...

34
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:53,700
...I am responsible for your safe passage,
and this is hardly reassuring.

35
00:04:53,784 --> 00:04:56,526
And you've already provided such passage.

36
00:05:10,869 --> 00:05:13,201
<i>It had to be taken as an act of kindness...</i>

37
00:05:13,285 --> 00:05:16,341
<i>...that the captain accompanied me
onto dry land.</i>

38
00:05:16,424 --> 00:05:18,924
<i>Nothing obliged him...</i>

39
00:05:19,008 --> 00:05:21,904
<i>...but during the journey we had come
to one of those understandings...</i>

40
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,613
<i>...that sometimes arise between
men of different generations.</i>

41
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:31,549
<i>The captain always treated me
with the courtesy of an executioner.</i>

42
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,217
<i>If he could do anything for me...</i>

43
00:05:36,094 --> 00:05:38,010
<i>...he would.</i>

44
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:51,466
Boys? Go back to the boat.

45
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:31,510
You in there! Open up!

46
00:06:39,773 --> 00:06:41,897
Can you hear me?

47
00:06:46,018 --> 00:06:47,584
Hello!

48
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,155
Hello?

49
00:07:46,741 --> 00:07:48,927
Hey! Wake up.

50
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,823
Fetch water toad.

51
00:07:54,948 --> 00:07:56,971
Wake up!

52
00:07:57,054 --> 00:08:00,798
Maritime signal technician.
We are replacing the weather official...

53
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:04,635
...Aldor Vigeland.
Can you tell me of his whereabouts?

54
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:14,295
I said where is the weather official?

55
00:08:17,856 --> 00:08:20,665
Listen here,
I'm captain of a ship in transit.

56
00:08:20,748 --> 00:08:25,201
I had to change course to bring this man
here and take his predecessor away.

57
00:08:26,014 --> 00:08:29,143
- Now where is...
- Typhus.

58
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:33,009
- He's dead?
- Do you have any tobacco?

59
00:08:34,134 --> 00:08:37,137
- Vodka?
- Where are the man's remains?

60
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,786
Christ, man, speak up!

61
00:08:44,948 --> 00:08:47,849
He went out one day. I never saw him again.

62
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:51,731
For God's sake, it's an island!
How far could he have gone?

63
00:08:52,544 --> 00:08:54,425
A swim?

64
00:08:54,925 --> 00:08:56,892
Your name?

65
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,644
Gruner.

66
00:09:01,436 --> 00:09:03,593
You like Frazer?

67
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,563
That's not my book.

68
00:09:06,521 --> 00:09:10,279
- You... you have tobacco?
- Not on my person, no.

69
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:13,465
Ah.

70
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,871
Mr. Gruner.

71
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,971
Captain...

72
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:40,230
...I appreciate your concern,
but I'm not about to turn back now.

73
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,622
Take this.

74
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,296
Don't mistake stubbornness with stupidity.

75
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,470
I'll manage.

76
00:09:50,996 --> 00:09:52,950
Thank you for all you've done.

77
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,572
Eat well. Work hard.

78
00:09:59,176 --> 00:10:01,135
Stay busy.

79
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:06,289
Fair winds.

80
00:10:06,997 --> 00:10:09,105
And following seas.

81
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:32,208
<i>I would have to live
in a solitude-like exile for 12 months...</i>

82
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:37,528
<i>...far from civilization with a job as
monotonous as it was insignificant...</i>

83
00:10:37,612 --> 00:10:40,591
<i>...to log the intensity
and direction of the winds.</i>

84
00:15:19,142 --> 00:15:20,538
Mr. Gruner?

85
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,188
Mr. Gruner?

86
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:33,019
Mr. Gruner, if this is your idea of an...

87
00:18:25,787 --> 00:18:27,702
Open the door!

88
00:18:31,701 --> 00:18:33,667
Let me in!

89
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,404
Gruner?

90
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:43,662
Gruner!

91
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:49,580
Gruner!

92
00:18:55,976 --> 00:18:59,361
- Please let me in!
- Should've stayed on the boat.

93
00:19:01,147 --> 00:19:02,835
Gruner!

94
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:13,383
Gruner!

95
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,329
<i>When I have fears that I may cease to be...</i>

96
00:19:25,413 --> 00:19:29,155
<i>...before my pen
has gleaned my teeming brain...</i>

97
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:31,866
<i>...before high-piled books, in charactery...</i>

98
00:19:31,949 --> 00:19:34,681
<i>...hold like rich garners
the full ripened grain...</i>

99
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:38,269
<i>...when I behold upon
the night's starred face...</i>

100
00:19:38,352 --> 00:19:41,421
<i>...huge cloudy symbols of a high romance...</i>

101
00:19:41,504 --> 00:19:44,099
<i>...and think that I may never live
to trace their shadows...</i>

102
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,389
<i>...with the magic hand of chance...</i>

103
00:19:46,472 --> 00:19:49,697
<i>...and when I feel,
fair creature of an hour...</i>

104
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,079
<i>...that I shall never look upon thee more...</i>

105
00:19:52,163 --> 00:19:56,074
<i>...never have relish in the faery
power of unreflecting love...</i>

106
00:19:56,158 --> 00:20:00,573
<i>...then on the shore
of the wide world I stand alone...</i>

107
00:20:00,656 --> 00:20:05,472
<i>...and think till love and fame
to nothingness do sink.</i>

108
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,953
Mother of God.

109
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:20,784
- No! Don't shoot!
- Put your gun down!

110
00:26:24,362 --> 00:26:26,303
Put it down!

111
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:36,061
Step back.

112
00:26:37,734 --> 00:26:39,150
Step back!

113
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:46,016
- What do you want?
- Do I really need to spell it out?

114
00:26:49,128 --> 00:26:50,979
You said you have tobacco?

115
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,706
- Yes.
- Coffee?

116
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:57,070
- Yes.
- Vodka?

117
00:26:57,153 --> 00:26:59,818
Gin. And ammunition.

118
00:27:00,443 --> 00:27:01,772
Caliber?

119
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:11,398
There's plenty more.

120
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:16,576
- She's harmless.
- Harmless?

121
00:27:17,076 --> 00:27:19,872
Come here. Come here.

122
00:27:21,914 --> 00:27:23,839
Come on.

123
00:27:25,152 --> 00:27:28,158
Good girl, easy. Good.

124
00:27:28,658 --> 00:27:30,071
See?

125
00:27:32,722 --> 00:27:35,869
I think I'll call you... Friend.

126
00:27:54,014 --> 00:27:57,140
- You got bit?
- Burned.

127
00:27:58,035 --> 00:28:00,683
- How many'd you kill?
- Don't know.

128
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:07,113
The previous weather official.
It wasn't typhus.

129
00:28:07,956 --> 00:28:10,381
You left him stranded here like me.

130
00:28:11,354 --> 00:28:13,228
It's as good as murder.

131
00:28:13,312 --> 00:28:15,262
We gotta go.

132
00:28:26,645 --> 00:28:28,581
Come on!

133
00:28:58,349 --> 00:28:59,802
Pain gone?

134
00:29:01,883 --> 00:29:05,269
- How long was I out for?
- Day or two by my reckoning.

135
00:29:06,303 --> 00:29:08,306
Pissed your pants.

136
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,442
1862.

137
00:29:25,288 --> 00:29:27,439
Now that's what I call an armory.

138
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,061
What's it doing?

139
00:29:32,873 --> 00:29:36,014
Stupid thing. Thinks stuff'll float away.

140
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:42,544
- You can speak with the beasts.
- Not speak, command.

141
00:29:45,058 --> 00:29:46,289
Doesn't it try and escape?

142
00:29:46,372 --> 00:29:49,147
Does a dog leave even
the cruelest of masters?

143
00:29:50,293 --> 00:29:52,474
It's incredible.

144
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:55,075
I never even imagined
such things could exist.

145
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:59,573
What we know is a small island
in the vast ocean of what we don't.

146
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:09,015
I've heard that there are atolls that contain
unique and endemic species of fish...

147
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:11,076
...that have evolved
completely independently.

148
00:30:12,773 --> 00:30:15,913
Hangover species
that have survived in isolation...

149
00:30:16,434 --> 00:30:19,123
...stuck in a kind of evolutionary stalemate.

150
00:30:21,928 --> 00:30:25,413
Maybe these beasts are like that,
not quite human...

151
00:30:25,756 --> 00:30:28,598
...nor amphibian, reptile or fish.

152
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:33,171
She's not quite like the others, is she?

153
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,443
This one doesn't bite, that's all.

154
00:30:37,526 --> 00:30:39,868
What about that scar on your shoulder?

155
00:30:40,785 --> 00:30:44,586
There was one time. The only time.
She learned her lesson.

156
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:48,408
Remember...

157
00:30:48,491 --> 00:30:51,655
...it's the still and silent sea
that drowns a man.

158
00:30:58,655 --> 00:31:02,014
I adjusted the mechanism
to sweep the coastline.

159
00:31:02,097 --> 00:31:05,897
All I know is that the toads,
like all infernal beasts...

160
00:31:06,813 --> 00:31:09,154
...they shun light, human or divine.

161
00:31:09,238 --> 00:31:11,144
Demons from Atlantis.

162
00:31:11,227 --> 00:31:13,201
I believe in what I see.

163
00:31:14,014 --> 00:31:18,014
One thing I still can't understand is that
you could have escaped four days ago...

164
00:31:18,097 --> 00:31:21,167
- ...on the boat that brought me here.
- Escape? To where?

165
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:26,302
- To a civilized world.
- Nice place, that civilized world of yours.

166
00:31:27,189 --> 00:31:29,351
That why you gave it up?

167
00:31:30,531 --> 00:31:34,265
Here I'm master of my own destiny,
come hell or high water.

168
00:31:34,348 --> 00:31:37,950
Well, you can keep it. I'm signaling
the first ship that passes by.

169
00:31:38,034 --> 00:31:41,270
Really? This island is not
on any commercial shipping lanes.

170
00:31:41,353 --> 00:31:43,077
The next ship here will be
the one with your replacement.

171
00:31:43,161 --> 00:31:45,875
Come on, Gruner, lighthouses are built
where there's naval transit.

172
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:50,416
They're also built to balance
navy budgets and siphon funds.

173
00:31:50,499 --> 00:31:53,904
Gotta empty a bucket
before you can fill it up again, boy.

174
00:31:58,412 --> 00:32:02,289
<i>It is the second time in a week
I'm forced to rebuild my life.</i>

175
00:32:03,917 --> 00:32:06,592
<i>All my belongings are burned.</i>

176
00:32:07,571 --> 00:32:09,971
<i>I've nothing from the person I used to be.</i>

177
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:13,306
<i>In this remote part of the world...</i>

178
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,974
<i>...I feel a sense of irreparable loss.</i>

179
00:32:16,058 --> 00:32:20,229
<i>I can't tell whether it arises
from a longing for civilization...</i>

180
00:32:21,354 --> 00:32:23,254
<i>...a prisoner's panic...</i>

181
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,653
<i>...or simply fear.</i>

182
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:20,786
Don't! Don't eat that. It's...

183
00:33:21,162 --> 00:33:23,098
...it's not edi...

184
00:33:25,102 --> 00:33:27,019
It's a can...

185
00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:31,481
Friend, get your rifle.

186
00:34:03,315 --> 00:34:06,810
Don't shoot till they reach the tower,
and don't waste bullets on their wounded.

187
00:34:06,893 --> 00:34:09,655
Give them enough carrion,
they'll devour each other.

188
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:32,949
I don't see anything.

189
00:34:33,033 --> 00:34:35,363
You'll learn what to look for.

190
00:35:03,913 --> 00:35:05,758
Come on!

191
00:35:06,695 --> 00:35:10,299
Come on! Shoot, man! Use your gun!

192
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,377
Come on, shoot!

193
00:36:23,315 --> 00:36:25,213
No man is an island.

194
00:36:26,442 --> 00:36:28,119
Horse shit.

195
00:36:28,684 --> 00:36:31,433
Gruner is an island.

196
00:36:32,097 --> 00:36:35,486
Gruner does not need any dead weight...

197
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,051
...no matter how much chocolate and coffee...

198
00:36:39,135 --> 00:36:41,011
...ladybird brought!

199
00:36:46,368 --> 00:36:49,317
Go fetch some water.

200
00:38:16,858 --> 00:38:18,414
One last chance.

201
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,644
Hold. Hold fast.

202
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,012
Wait.

203
00:39:25,335 --> 00:39:26,619
Hold.

204
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:29,308
Steady.

205
00:39:36,393 --> 00:39:39,422
Behind you! Wake up, man! Wake up!

206
00:39:39,505 --> 00:39:41,897
Shoot! Shoot, dammit! Shoot!

207
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,273
Shoot! One last chance!

208
00:39:57,333 --> 00:40:00,419
Gruner, wait, don't! Gruner!

209
00:40:04,844 --> 00:40:08,040
Gruner! Let me in!

210
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,187
Gruner!

211
00:41:50,645 --> 00:41:54,826
<i>Gruner and I settled into
a curious sort of co-existence...</i>

212
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,396
<i>...based on routine.</i>

213
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:00,230
<i>The monsters always swarm at night...</i>

214
00:42:00,314 --> 00:42:03,304
<i>...their strikes growing longer every day.</i>

215
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:09,410
<i>The Japanese philosopher Musashi said
that only a few appreciate the art of war.</i>

216
00:42:10,459 --> 00:42:13,530
<i>A good warrior is not defined
by the cause he defends...</i>

217
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:16,614
<i>...but rather by the meaning
that derives from the struggle.</i>

218
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:20,513
<i>Days are always the same.</i>

219
00:42:20,992 --> 00:42:23,979
<i>I abandon my post on the balcony
at the break of dawn.</i>

220
00:42:24,063 --> 00:42:26,989
<i>Nature dictates the length of my slumber.</i>

221
00:42:27,853 --> 00:42:30,395
<i>I have to accept the most ungrateful tasks...</i>

222
00:42:30,478 --> 00:42:33,516
<i>...simply to keep my place
inside the lighthouse.</i>

223
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:38,058
<i>I've been meditating on my reason
for coming to this island.</i>

224
00:42:40,914 --> 00:42:43,861
<i>I had been seeking peace through nothingness.</i>

225
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:46,453
<i>But in place of silence...</i>

226
00:42:46,985 --> 00:42:49,914
<i>...I found a monster-plagued inferno.</i>

227
00:42:53,975 --> 00:42:57,591
Smells strange.
How do you know that the herbs aren't bad?

228
00:42:57,674 --> 00:43:00,323
Herbs are like people.
They are neither good or bad.

229
00:43:00,406 --> 00:43:05,177
- They're just known or unknown, that's all.
- Herbs won't slit your throat for money.

230
00:43:05,261 --> 00:43:09,155
A farmer keeps cows.
He cares for them. He feeds them.

231
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:11,603
He gives them endearing names.

232
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,221
Like Daisy.

233
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:18,372
But then he steals her milk.

234
00:43:20,022 --> 00:43:22,199
And he kills her children.

235
00:43:22,283 --> 00:43:25,963
- Another riddle.
- It's a question of necessity.

236
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:30,204
Has it ever occurred to you that it might
be her wailing that attracts the beasts?

237
00:43:32,586 --> 00:43:35,118
But then why would they attack
some nights and not others?

238
00:43:35,201 --> 00:43:37,683
And why would she lure
her own kin to die on the rocks?

239
00:43:37,766 --> 00:43:42,072
The only thing you need to understand
is that we are the invaders...

240
00:43:42,155 --> 00:43:44,226
...which makes us the enemy.

241
00:43:45,329 --> 00:43:48,295
Kill and conquer, that's what we humans do.

242
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:52,804
- You want to conquer them. Is that it?
- Oh, no, I want to exterminate them.

243
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,879
We need more timber.

244
00:44:07,088 --> 00:44:08,677
Why?

245
00:44:09,334 --> 00:44:11,342
We haven't been attacked in weeks.

246
00:44:12,779 --> 00:44:14,786
You like sleeping in my lighthouse.

247
00:44:24,738 --> 00:44:26,598
<i>Faded.</i>

248
00:44:27,561 --> 00:44:29,452
<i>Far away.</i>

249
00:44:31,772 --> 00:44:33,414
<i>Dissolved.</i>

250
00:44:39,205 --> 00:44:41,104
<i>And quite forgotten.</i>

251
00:45:01,058 --> 00:45:04,647
<i>My eyes have scrutinized
every surface a thousand times.</i>

252
00:45:05,837 --> 00:45:10,044
<i>We speak of the lighthouse and its environs
as if it were an entire state.</i>

253
00:45:11,249 --> 00:45:13,567
<i>Every nook and cranny has a name.</i>

254
00:45:14,302 --> 00:45:16,189
<i>Every rock.</i>

255
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,159
<i>Every stone.</i>

256
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:27,212
Maybe they migrate,
like the whales in winter.

257
00:45:29,722 --> 00:45:32,346
Or maybe the creatures
reason they can't defeat us.

258
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:34,347
They're beasts.

259
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:38,119
They are out there gathering
in numbers for their next attack.

260
00:45:39,056 --> 00:45:40,965
You're on watch.

261
00:45:47,906 --> 00:45:51,347
<i>Although it may seem strange,
the lulls between fighting...</i>

262
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:54,356
<i>...are often worse
than the battles themselves.</i>

263
00:45:56,245 --> 00:46:00,088
<i>This void is accompanied
by the mascot's change in attitude.</i>

264
00:46:35,685 --> 00:46:40,290
<i>How could Gruner lie with one of the very
same monsters that plague us every night?</i>

265
00:46:45,906 --> 00:46:48,102
<i>How did he manage to justify the act...</i>

266
00:46:49,785 --> 00:46:53,760
<i>...in defiance of all the obstacles
set down by civilization?</i>

267
00:46:55,538 --> 00:46:57,462
<i>Set down by nature.</i>

268
00:47:13,394 --> 00:47:15,550
<i>How could he get closer...</i>

269
00:47:16,363 --> 00:47:18,259
<i>...and closer...</i>

270
00:47:22,285 --> 00:47:25,481
<i>...and not be repelled by her cold skin?</i>

271
00:47:30,687 --> 00:47:32,981
<i>I have decided to give her a name.</i>

272
00:47:34,552 --> 00:47:36,172
<i>Aneris.</i>

273
00:47:40,656 --> 00:47:42,117
<i>Down.</i>

274
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:09,895
- When'd we run out of potatoes?
- We didn't. You're drinking 'em.

275
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,429
You play?

276
00:48:23,074 --> 00:48:25,020
What civilized man doesn't?

277
00:48:29,493 --> 00:48:32,647
These beasts really are
a fascinating species.

278
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:37,061
Take the blood, for example. I imagine
that it must share the properties...

279
00:48:37,144 --> 00:48:39,159
...of some arctic fish...

280
00:48:39,242 --> 00:48:43,663
...containing a kind of anti-freeze to
help them to survive in sub-zero conditions.

281
00:48:44,475 --> 00:48:46,798
Have you noticed that they've
got two sets of eyelids?

282
00:48:46,881 --> 00:48:51,200
Now the first, very much like ours,
but the second is a transparent membrane...

283
00:48:51,284 --> 00:48:53,551
...helping them when they dive,
I would imagine.

284
00:48:53,635 --> 00:48:55,719
We could capture specimens...

285
00:48:55,802 --> 00:48:59,016
...take them back to Great Britain or to
the United States, present our discovery...

286
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:01,522
- ...and we would be celebrated...
- All right, you got me!

287
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:05,296
I came down to the asshole of the world
to become famous. All right?

288
00:49:05,851 --> 00:49:08,450
Check! Now shut up and play.

289
00:49:13,191 --> 00:49:14,991
Check mate.

290
00:49:19,419 --> 00:49:21,571
No, it can't be.

291
00:49:22,363 --> 00:49:25,771
- It ju... it just can't be.
- Calm down, Gruner, it's only a game.

292
00:49:25,854 --> 00:49:29,087
- Kings, pawns.
- It can't be!

293
00:49:30,741 --> 00:49:34,188
We forgot the light! Galley deck!

294
00:50:53,046 --> 00:50:56,510
I'm out! There's too many! There's too many!

295
00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:02,833
So what do we know do now?

296
00:52:09,956 --> 00:52:13,169
<i># One starry night #</i>

297
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:18,878
<i># As I lay sleeping #</i>

298
00:52:19,243 --> 00:52:21,777

304
00:52:44,128 --> 00:52:45,247
I wh...

305
00:53:04,285 --> 00:53:08,261
Look at us. We can't survive
another assault like that.

306
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:11,499
We're running out of supplies.

307
00:53:12,416 --> 00:53:15,790
Running out of ammunition.
Running out of will.

308
00:54:02,968 --> 00:54:06,086
Where are you going? Hey! What is it?

309
00:54:06,169 --> 00:54:08,112
There's a boat!

310
00:54:27,204 --> 00:54:28,825
No!

311
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,969
Gruner knows how to defend himself.

312
00:54:33,052 --> 00:54:34,947
Gruner rules the world!

313
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:39,335
Gruner wants what he has
and has only what he wants!

314
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:47,129
- Ungrateful little bitch!
- No.

315
00:54:47,213 --> 00:54:50,563
- Get out of my way, boy!
- Please, Gruner.

316
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:05,217
No more people.

317
00:55:06,285 --> 00:55:08,233
I see what you are!

318
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:12,488
A sad, pathetic failure of a misanthrope!

319
00:55:13,923 --> 00:55:16,605
You're too afraid to let your friends leave!

320
00:55:17,452 --> 00:55:19,959
Too afraid to kill your enemies!

321
00:55:20,459 --> 00:55:23,050
Afraid of having no one left to hate.

322
00:56:35,779 --> 00:56:37,442
Look.

323
00:56:43,789 --> 00:56:45,412
Look.

324
00:56:59,978 --> 00:57:02,479
What has he done to you this time?

325
00:57:17,497 --> 00:57:19,718
We call this...

326
00:57:19,801 --> 00:57:21,711
...a "boat."

327
00:57:26,275 --> 00:57:27,831
You see?

328
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,090
What?

329
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,277
I found a rowboat.

330
00:59:00,406 --> 00:59:02,283
I know of it.

331
00:59:02,887 --> 00:59:05,175
Sorry, what? Why didn't you say so?

332
00:59:05,259 --> 00:59:08,770
Wouldn't do you no good.
I'm sure you'll make it off my island.

333
00:59:08,853 --> 00:59:12,952
Then you'd be taken by hypothermia,
starvation, a storm...

334
00:59:13,036 --> 00:59:15,598
...most likely end up
as toad food, but, hey...

335
00:59:15,681 --> 00:59:18,883
...who am I to deny you
the right to choose how you die?

336
00:59:20,656 --> 00:59:23,168
- Where'd it come from?
- Belonged to some Portuguese.

337
00:59:23,251 --> 00:59:25,790
- Shipwreck?
- Tremendous storm.

338
00:59:25,873 --> 00:59:27,089
Came to grief in the night.

339
00:59:27,172 --> 00:59:30,141
And I'm sure you did everything
you could to save them.

340
00:59:30,224 --> 00:59:31,980
I did what I could.

341
00:59:32,064 --> 00:59:36,390
Those that made it ashore were set upon
trying to reach the lighthouse.

342
00:59:36,473 --> 00:59:40,569
Nothing left of them by the morning.
Dragged back down to the depths.

343
00:59:40,652 --> 00:59:42,746
What were they doing so far
from commercial routes?

344
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:46,379
It was an illegal ship. Dynamite smugglers.

345
00:59:46,463 --> 00:59:49,370
Found some crates washed up ashore.

346
00:59:49,453 --> 00:59:52,289
No good though, all waterlogged.

347
01:00:08,212 --> 01:00:11,673
- You want to dive that ship.
- We recover the dynamite...

348
01:00:11,756 --> 01:00:15,378
...repair the rowboat, head out in the
morning at low tide when it's safest.

349
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,393
You're an idiot.

350
01:00:18,476 --> 01:00:20,626
What is it about blowing up
a thousand toads you don't like?

351
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:22,628
Suicide mission,
I'm not going down in that water.

352
01:00:22,712 --> 01:00:24,361
Scared?

353
01:00:28,187 --> 01:00:31,865
I'll do it. All I require
from you is to pump my air.

354
01:00:31,948 --> 01:00:35,787
- Won't work.
- I'm talking about toad extermination.

355
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:37,515
No.

356
01:02:28,337 --> 01:02:30,280
I changed my mind.

357
01:02:30,885 --> 01:02:32,835
We leave right away.

358
01:03:02,878 --> 01:03:05,662
Remember, one tug on the rope...

359
01:03:05,745 --> 01:03:08,601
...everything's fine, two, load is secured.

360
01:03:08,685 --> 01:03:10,275
Three...

361
01:03:12,417 --> 01:03:14,129
...three, row for your life.

362
01:08:29,234 --> 01:08:31,508
The second line's too close
to the lighthouse.

363
01:08:31,591 --> 01:08:35,788
At this distance, the toads
will be packed in nice and tight...

364
01:08:35,871 --> 01:08:37,747
...like a can of sardines.

365
01:08:38,497 --> 01:08:41,464
We'll end up perched
on the leaning tower of Pisa.

366
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:07,504
<i>The Austral summer is fading
timidly but with grandeur.</i>

367
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:12,979
<i>Now we are inexorably
heading toward the winter.</i>

368
01:09:15,070 --> 01:09:16,959
<i>Or rather, the darkness.</i>

369
01:09:24,415 --> 01:09:27,127
<i>Time is a relative idea.</i>

370
01:09:28,897 --> 01:09:33,353
<i>Drops suspended from a spider web
for centuries before it falls.</i>

371
01:09:34,296 --> 01:09:36,260
<i>Sometimes, however...</i>

372
01:09:36,655 --> 01:09:39,644
<i>...a week passes in the blink of an eye.</i>

373
01:11:22,029 --> 01:11:23,941
Come inside.

374
01:12:01,435 --> 01:12:04,450
Three weeks. Three weeks and nothing.

375
01:12:33,650 --> 01:12:35,992
- We can't eat that garbage!
- Gruner.

376
01:12:36,075 --> 01:12:40,319
She told them. You told your friends, huh?
You warned them, didn't you? Huh?

377
01:12:40,402 --> 01:12:44,519
You fucking little toad spy.
This is how you repay me, huh?

378
01:12:44,602 --> 01:12:46,267
- You ungrateful, bitch!
- Gruner!

379
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:50,708
How dare you leave me?
Dare you leave me! Try it! Try it again!

380
01:12:54,466 --> 01:12:58,753
We ambush them. We leave the main
door open and lure them inside.

381
01:12:58,837 --> 01:13:01,621
You pick them off from the stairs.
I operate the detonator...

382
01:13:01,704 --> 01:13:03,580
...once they're close enough.

383
01:14:27,330 --> 01:14:30,044
Gruner, Babel's open.

384
01:14:30,127 --> 01:14:32,561
- Lanterns!
- Burning.

385
01:15:50,624 --> 01:15:53,994
Come on, come on, sing! Come on!

386
01:15:54,077 --> 01:15:57,917
Come on! Come on! Sing!
Sing! Sing for your supper!

387
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,630
Sing!

388
01:15:59,726 --> 01:16:02,745
Sing! Sing! Sing! There you go!

389
01:16:58,176 --> 01:17:01,881
Sing! Sing! Come on!

390
01:18:08,836 --> 01:18:10,759
They're in!

391
01:18:16,721 --> 01:18:18,745
They're here!

392
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:34,681
It's not working!

393
01:18:37,743 --> 01:18:39,518
The contact!

394
01:19:10,471 --> 01:19:12,027
Get down!

395
01:19:20,586 --> 01:19:22,397
No, Gruner...

396
01:20:22,948 --> 01:20:24,529
Gruner.

397
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:28,089
Gruner, can you hear me?

398
01:20:29,364 --> 01:20:30,986
Gruner.

399
01:20:42,324 --> 01:20:45,295
Under the wide and starry sky...

400
01:20:46,837 --> 01:20:49,375
...dig my grave and let me lie.

401
01:20:50,468 --> 01:20:53,392
Glad did I live and gladly die.

402
01:20:54,309 --> 01:20:56,876
And I laid me down with a will.

403
01:21:46,326 --> 01:21:49,104
Use your knife. Don't waste ammunition.

404
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:05,593
Look at what we've done.

405
01:22:55,395 --> 01:22:57,503
She'll do that for a time.

406
01:22:59,466 --> 01:23:01,648
Wail away like that.

407
01:23:04,339 --> 01:23:06,295
That's how I found her.

408
01:23:07,212 --> 01:23:10,831
Tangled in a net, little tyke.

409
01:23:11,947 --> 01:23:14,116
Cute that way, aren't they?

410
01:23:16,117 --> 01:23:18,066
They don't stay that way.

411
01:23:20,763 --> 01:23:22,664
Cut it free.

412
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:25,210
Saved its life, I did.

413
01:23:30,201 --> 01:23:32,305
It'll come groveling back.

414
01:23:34,593 --> 01:23:36,676
She always does.

415
01:23:54,959 --> 01:23:56,875
They're mourning.

416
01:25:50,342 --> 01:25:52,258
Look at this.

417
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:55,476
It's brilliant.

418
01:25:55,976 --> 01:26:00,460
We have to keep up the pretense.
New, more powerful weapons.

419
01:26:00,543 --> 01:26:02,861
Putting the fear in them.

420
01:31:13,629 --> 01:31:16,485
I see you, king of the toads!

421
01:31:16,988 --> 01:31:20,701
Don't harm them, Gruner.
A truce is what I think they want.

422
01:31:21,430 --> 01:31:24,543
Gruner, put your rifle down.
Show them that you mean no harm.

423
01:31:28,208 --> 01:31:30,124
We were wrong.

424
01:31:31,793 --> 01:31:34,156
Gruner, we were wrong.

425
01:31:41,959 --> 01:31:43,706
Go inside.

426
01:31:49,942 --> 01:31:51,769
I said inside!

427
01:31:57,608 --> 01:31:59,556
Leave me?

428
01:32:00,874 --> 01:32:04,377
No one leaves. No one leaves.

429
01:32:04,461 --> 01:32:07,199
I leave. No one leaves Gruner!

430
01:32:08,272 --> 01:32:10,224
You don't leave.

431
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:13,463
You don't leave. You don't leave.

432
01:32:15,025 --> 01:32:16,927
No one leaves Gruner!

433
01:32:17,902 --> 01:32:20,773
Gruner leaves. Gruner leaves... Gruner...

434
01:32:20,856 --> 01:32:25,654
You don't leave Gruner, no!
You don't leave! Gruner leaves.

435
01:32:27,302 --> 01:32:30,945
No one leaves Gruner! Gruner leaves.

436
01:33:20,970 --> 01:33:22,539
Wait.

437
01:33:49,495 --> 01:33:50,858
Gruner!

438
01:33:52,855 --> 01:33:54,967
Gruner!

439
01:33:55,050 --> 01:33:56,718
Gruner!

440
01:34:26,764 --> 01:34:29,298
Aldor Vigeland, you're no murderer!

441
01:34:56,356 --> 01:34:57,940
Love.

442
01:35:01,324 --> 01:35:02,911
Love.

443
01:35:06,683 --> 01:35:08,275
Love.

444
01:37:09,894 --> 01:37:11,819
Mr. Gruner?

445
01:37:13,733 --> 01:37:16,462
Maritime signal technician Gruner.

446
01:37:19,031 --> 01:37:21,171
All right, get up!

447
01:37:31,946 --> 01:37:35,353
We are here to replace
the weather official with this man.

448
01:37:35,437 --> 01:37:37,556
Do you know where he is?

449
01:37:40,655 --> 01:37:42,538
Speak up!

450
01:37:45,706 --> 01:37:47,295
Typhus.

451
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:53,529
This place is a pigsty! Look at yourself.

452
01:37:53,614 --> 01:37:57,725
You are in no fit state to hold the position
of signal technician. We're at war, man!

453
01:37:58,371 --> 01:38:00,276
Get back here!

454
01:38:03,977 --> 01:38:07,262
I believe the poor soul
is ill from isolation, sir.

455
01:38:07,345 --> 01:38:10,324
- You know the saying. No man...
- We'll have him seen to.

456
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:13,013
Search the island.
