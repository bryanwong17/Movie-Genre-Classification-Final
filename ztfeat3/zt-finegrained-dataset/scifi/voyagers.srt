As the Earth continues to heat up

4
00:01:10,084 --> 00:01:12,502
and devastating droughts
and famine plague the population,

5
00:01:12,596 --> 00:01:17,863
science is looking for a new planet
on which human life can thrive.

6
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:23,067
And it finds that in year 2063.

The red is oxygen.

9
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:34,278
This is our best chance
to find a habitable planet.

10
00:01:34,312 --> 00:01:35,881
One we can colonize

11
00:01:35,914 --> 00:01:39,517
and so ensure the
survival of our species.

12
00:01:39,551 --> 00:01:41,854
With the deteriorating
situation here on Earth,

13
00:01:41,887 --> 00:01:44,188
it's essential we send
a scouting mission

15

The voyage there will
take 86 years.

16
00:01:50,395 --> 00:01:53,197
So, the crew will
reproduce onboard the ship,

17
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:57,335

the ones who reach the planet.

21
00:02:52,758 --> 00:02:56,595
Our first challenge was finding
30 qualified crew members

22
00:02:56,628 --> 00:02:59,430
able to cope with the stress
of prolonged confinement.

23
00:02:59,464 --> 00:03:02,534
That and the knowledge that
they won't be coming back.

24
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:06,504
Our solution,
breed and raise our own crew.

25
00:03:06,538 --> 00:03:09,875
Train them in isolation
so they won't miss Earth.

26
00:03:09,908 --> 00:03:12,443
Then the next
step is to assess

27
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:15,047
when they'll be
ready to go.

28
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,449
The younger they are,
the longer we can conserve resources

29
00:03:18,483 --> 00:03:21,352
and extend the timeline
of the mission.

30
