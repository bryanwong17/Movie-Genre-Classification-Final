(LAING CONTINUES PLAYING)

321
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,450
I'd conceived this building
to be a crucible for change.

322
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,400
I must have missed some vital element.

323
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,522
WOMAN: What are you going to do about it?

324
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,449
There are women on my floor with babies

325
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,127
and they can't even boil a kettle so
they can sterilise their babies' bottles.

326
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:21,644
Look... Look! If you lower people
overload the system, there'll be cuts.

327
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,410
Who are you calling people?

328
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,040
I commend your bravery, old son,
but don't push it.

329
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,640
You know very well
that's not what we were sold.

330
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,924
I know for a fact that you're in arrears
with your service payments, Mr Wilder.

331
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,771
You're hardly in a position
to take the moral high ground.

332
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,803
- Tell him.
- No.

333
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,524
Go on!

334
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,291
My daughter was interfered with
in the dark.

335
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,528
She's certain it was someone from the top.

336
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,529
He was wearing expensive cologne

337
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,041
and stuffed a copy
of the Financial Times in her mouth.

338
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,003
We pay the same charges as the top floors.

339
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,929
We want our fair share of the power.

340
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,522
Now you pull your finger out
or I'll take it above your head!

341
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,881
I think you've made your point, Wilder.

342
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,287
Hey, wait. Why don't you
just hold on a minute there?

343
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,562
Where the bloody hell
do you think you're going?

344
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,887
The service lift's out.
I've gotta come up front.

345
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,445
White wine. Thank God.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oi, oi.

347

If you're thinking of taking
your grievances to the top,

348
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,450
I doubt you'll find much sympathy.

349
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,409
You've met the architect?

350
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,251
Hovers over the place
like a fucking albatross.

351
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,568
One should pity him, really.

352
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,286
Oh, one should, should one?

353
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,165
Very magnanimous of you, I'm sure.

354
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,208
Listen, you couldn't give me a lift
to the television studios, could you?

355
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,322
No, I'm sorry, um...

356
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,843
I can't seem to remember
where I left my car.

WILDER: Funny. Neither can I.

Why don't we have to go to school?

359

I don't know. I'll think of something.

about Anthony Royal,

- If you like.

917

Shouldn't be too difficult.
We've already made contact with Laing.

we can give Laing in exchange.

draw up plans
