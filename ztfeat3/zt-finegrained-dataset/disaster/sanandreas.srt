Hello, Chris.

01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:24,803
I'm here with Dr. Lawrence Hayes, Executive
Director for Earthquake Studies at Caltech.

941
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,407
He and his research partner,
Dr. Kim Park...

942
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,961
...have come up with a model
that predicts earthquakes.

943
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,607
They knew L.A. was going to get hit.

- Go ahead, doctor.
- Okay.

947
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:42,248
In seismology terms, what we're
experiencing is what we call a swarm event.

948
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,288
Basically, California's entire
tectonic plate has shifted.

949
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:50,604
The quake we experienced in Los Angeles
did damage all the way up in San Francisco.

950
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:54,207
Yeah, but the earthquake that they felt
was from movement along the fault line...

951
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,361
...in the Central Valley.

952
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,727
Their end of the fault line
has not moved yet.

953
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:01,562
More importantly, people need to know
that the shaking is not over.

954
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,569
And it's not aftershocks I'm talking about.

955
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,644
San Francisco will get hit again.
