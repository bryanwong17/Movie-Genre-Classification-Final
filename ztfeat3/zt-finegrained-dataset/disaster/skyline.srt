00:13:47,456 --> 00:13:49,367
Oh, yeah! Go!

161
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:52,175
Go! Go! Go! Go!

162
00:13:54,257 --> 00:13:56,372
Oh, my God! No!

163
00:13:57,936 --> 00:13:59,165
- God, no!
- No!

164
00:13:59,337 --> 00:14:00,690
No!

165
00:14:00,857 --> 00:14:02,848
- Oh, my God!
- [doorbell rings]

166
00:14:10,777 --> 00:14:14,407
Pardon me, ma'am, but we've received
a few noise complaints.

167
00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:16,455
From who?

168
00:14:16,618 --> 00:14:18,892
- The building's half empty.
- I understand that.

169
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:22,255
But the other half is trying to sleep.
So if you don't mind, just...

170
00:14:22,418 --> 00:14:23,852
- Fine.
- OK.

171
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:41,051
- Another one for the books.
- Oh, yeah.

172
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,573
Well, well, well.

173
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,129
- Mm-mm. I call the couch.
- Oh, come on.

174
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,655
- There's plenty of room for both of us.
- I like my space.

175
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,095
Whoa. All right.

176
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,251
Beggars can't be choosers.

177
00:15:04,221 --> 00:15:06,212
- [bleeps]
- Good night.

178
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,616
[rumbling]

179
00:16:25,665 --> 00:16:27,656
Earthquake?

180
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:29,657
Probably just a tremor.

181
00:16:50,506 --> 00:16:52,737
What the...?

182
00:17:11,548 --> 00:17:13,300
Turn off the lights.

183
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,106
Ray.

184
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:28,900
What are you doing?

185
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:34,144
Ray.

186
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:36,300
What is that?

187
00:17:46,189 --> 00:17:48,260
Ray!

188
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,780
Stay here.

189
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,741
- What's wrong?
- He's gone!

190
00:18:09,551 --> 00:18:11,189
Jarrod, no.

191
00:18:11,831 --> 00:18:14,106
Jarrod, no!

192
00:18:14,271 --> 00:18:17,069
- Jarrod. Jarrod. No!
- [Terry] What the hell's going on?

193
00:18:17,231 --> 00:18:19,700
Terry, please! Terry, help!

194
00:18:22,551 --> 00:18:24,907
What's with you, man?

195
00:18:25,712 --> 00:18:28,067
Jarrod.

196
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,302
Oh, my God. Jarrod, Jarrod.

197
00:18:30,472 --> 00:18:33,623
- Jarrod!
- Please. What's happening?

198
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:38,782
- Jarrod?
- [Elaine] Jarrod. Oh, God. Oh, my God.

199
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:42,070
Jarrod. What is that?

200
00:18:44,313 --> 00:18:46,065
What's wrong with him?

201
00:18:47,273 --> 00:18:49,264
Jarrod. Oh, my God.

202
00:18:50,273 --> 00:18:52,867
- Where's Ray? Where's Ray?
- Terry, no.

203
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:54,547
- No, no.
- Jarrod?

204
00:18:54,714 --> 00:18:56,032
- Where is he?
- He's gone.

205
00:18:56,193 --> 00:18:57,707
- What do you mean?
- He's gone!

206
00:18:57,874 --> 00:19:00,627
- Did he fall? Did he jump?
- No! I don't know, I don't know.

207
00:19:00,794 --> 00:19:04,707
[Elaine] Please. Please. Please.

208
00:19:04,874 --> 00:19:07,388
He went outside, to the light.

209
00:19:08,954 --> 00:19:11,549
And then he... he just disappeared.

210
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,513
- [gasps for breath]
- Baby.

211
00:19:17,594 --> 00:19:19,472
Terry, please.

212
00:19:38,516 --> 00:19:43,146
Jarrod, look at me.
What did you see, huh? What did you see?

213
00:19:46,037 --> 00:19:47,071
Careful.

214
00:19:57,157 --> 00:19:59,148
Jarrod, what happened?

215
00:20:01,437 --> 00:20:03,189
I don't know.

216
00:20:07,357 --> 00:20:08,996
I was being pulled...

217
00:20:10,198 --> 00:20:12,837
...towards this light.

218
00:20:12,998 --> 00:20:15,193
[crashing]

219
00:20:21,478 --> 00:20:23,514
Hey, open the blinds.

220
00:20:23,678 --> 00:20:25,510
- No.
- Open the blinds!

221
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,590
- No!
- God!

222
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:42,436
- There's something down there.
- What?

223
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,079
Jarrod, check this out.

224
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,955
I don't see anything.

225
00:21:00,121 --> 00:21:04,478
- There are people on the roof.
- [Elaine] What are they doing?

226
00:21:04,641 --> 00:21:07,109
I don't know.

227
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:12,280
- We should check it out.
- You don't know what's out there.

228
00:21:15,961 --> 00:21:17,952
- Yeah, OK.
- All right.

229
00:21:18,122 --> 00:21:20,113
I’m calling the police.

230
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:26,199
- I’ll try and get some pictures.
- You can't go out there.

231
00:21:27,482 --> 00:21:29,120
I can't let him go out there alone.

232
00:21:29,282 --> 00:21:31,159
It just keeps ringing.

233
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:38,992
A gun? Really?

234
00:21:39,162 --> 00:21:42,041
Just check the news
and find out what the hell is going on.

235
00:21:42,203 --> 00:21:44,478
- Terry...
- We'll be right back.

236
00:21:46,243 --> 00:21:48,234
- Jarrod.
- Look at me.

237
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:58,473
Let's go.

238
00:21:58,644 --> 00:22:00,440
Hurry back.

239
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:30,117
Stairs are this way.

240
00:22:35,246 --> 00:22:37,237
[clanging]

241
00:22:53,607 --> 00:22:56,405
- [barking]
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

242
00:22:56,567 --> 00:22:59,001
- Dammit, Walt.
- What's going on?

243
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:02,604
- We're going to check it out.
- What are you doing with a gun?

244
00:23:02,768 --> 00:23:05,327
Get back in your apartment. Go.

245
00:23:05,487 --> 00:23:08,002
And keep it down.

246
00:23:14,328 --> 00:23:16,319
Hey...

247
00:23:17,528 --> 00:23:18,881
You sure about this?

248
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:31,517
There's been nothing new since 4 am.

249
00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:35,641
Denise, check the TV.

250
00:24:03,891 --> 00:24:05,722
It’s calm.

251
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:11,969
Dammit, Jarrod.

252
00:24:12,131 --> 00:24:16,044
- You didn't tell me to hold it open.
- I thought it was common sense.

253
00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:19,681
I’m sorry.

254
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:22,366
- [crashing]
- Get down.

255
00:24:27,212 --> 00:24:29,203
What now?

256
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:32,448
Let's get a better look.

257
00:24:37,373 --> 00:24:38,725
[ringing tone]

258
00:24:38,893 --> 00:24:41,646
Hi, this is Jackie.
Please leave a message.

259
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:46,523
- [bleeps]
- Mom, it's me. Something's happened...

260
00:24:48,733 --> 00:24:51,486
Pick up. Please just...

261
00:24:53,414 --> 00:24:55,450
Call me back as soon as you get this.

262
00:25:03,854 --> 00:25:06,653
- [engaged tone]
- [crashing outside]

263
00:25:39,376 --> 00:25:41,367
[crashing]

264
00:25:52,737 --> 00:25:55,251
Holy shit.

265
00:26:24,579 --> 00:26:27,969
I can't see it.
Is that what I think it is?

266
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:34,656
Oh, my God.

267
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:11,460
- Just run.
- What is it?

268
00:27:11,621 --> 00:27:12,691
- Run!
- Go!

269
00:27:18,462 --> 00:27:21,135
Come on, pull! Back up! Back up!

270
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:26,697
Come on! Come on!

271
00:27:28,222 --> 00:27:31,898
- [Terry yells]
- Come on! Come on!

272
00:27:36,703 --> 00:27:39,171
Come on!

273
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:43,574
[Jarrod] Elaine, no!

274
00:27:55,704 --> 00:27:58,138
Move. Move!

275
00:27:58,904 --> 00:28:01,543
Come on. It’s OK.

276
00:28:01,704 --> 00:28:04,264
Baby, are you OK?

277
00:28:04,424 --> 00:28:07,700
I feel like I’m on fire.

278
00:28:07,864 --> 00:28:10,504
Come on, baby. I’m here.

279
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:15,783
Give me the... Give it to me.

280
00:28:19,105 --> 00:28:22,257
It'll pass in a few minutes. Look at me.

281
00:28:25,265 --> 00:28:27,257
Look at me.

282
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:48,658
You looked too.

283
00:28:51,627 --> 00:28:53,618
How?

284
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,904
Oh, my God.

285
00:29:14,548 --> 00:29:16,460
All those people.

286
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:28,181
- What do they want with them?
- I’m not looking to find out.

287
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:32,389
[woman] God, I can't believe this.
I mean, how?

288
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,665
[Jarrod] Once you look at the light...

289
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:41,061
...it grabs hold and it's like...

290
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,221
It controls you.

291
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:47,341
I mean, who wouldn't wanna look
at something so beautiful?

292
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,743
It’s kind of brilliant, actually.

293
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:55,500
Enough of this shit. I got an idea.

294
00:29:55,671 --> 00:29:57,467
- Where are you going?
- Walt.

295
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,269
- [Jarrod] What for?
- I worry about him.

296
00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:02,104
- [Denise] Terry...
- Everything's under control.

297
00:30:31,153 --> 00:30:33,462
Are you OK?

298
00:30:33,633 --> 00:30:35,669
- Yeah, it's nothing.
- Let me see.

299
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,824
I said it's nothing.

300
00:30:40,273 --> 00:30:42,264
All right.

301
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,912
[whispers] Walt.

302
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,787
Yo, Walt.

303
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,307
Walt.

304
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:32,347
Walt.

305
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:35,467
Are you in here?

306
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:54,311
[barking]

307
00:31:54,477 --> 00:31:56,196
[growling]

308
00:31:56,358 --> 00:31:59,475
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hiding.

309
00:31:59,638 --> 00:32:05,156
I saw the people in the sky
like a goddamn rapture.

310
00:32:05,318 --> 00:32:09,106
Come on. We're taking your car and we're
getting the hell out of here. Let's go.

311
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:11,349
- I’m not going out there.
- [whirring]

312
00:32:11,518 --> 00:32:14,909
- [barking]
- Get down. Get down.

313
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,068
- Shh!
- Shut the dog up. Shut the dog up.

314
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:02,037
Shh!

315
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:38,192
- No!
- No! No! Walt!

316
00:33:38,363 --> 00:33:40,275
[Walt screams]

317
00:34:02,524 --> 00:34:05,243
[gunshots]

318
00:34:07,205 --> 00:34:09,196
Did you hear that?

319
00:34:12,405 --> 00:34:13,997
What's up? Talk to me.

320
00:34:15,326 --> 00:34:16,805
We're getting on my boat
and getting out of here.

321
00:34:16,966 --> 00:34:18,921
- What happened?
- They took Walt.

322
00:34:19,085 --> 00:34:20,723
They got Walt?
What are you talking about?

323
00:34:20,885 --> 00:34:24,595
This one was different. It came in
the building and it just snatched him.

324
00:34:25,686 --> 00:34:28,883
- Then we should just go.
- Hold on a sec.

325
00:34:29,046 --> 00:34:31,560
Am I the only one who saw those photos?

326
00:34:31,726 --> 00:34:34,843
That's all happening right outside,
right now. They're everywhere.

327
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:38,556
No, they're not everywhere.
They're not over the water.

328
00:34:38,726 --> 00:34:39,716
That's right.

329
00:34:39,887 --> 00:34:43,926
Yeah, well, it didn't take 'em very long
to find you on the roof.

330
00:34:44,087 --> 00:34:45,759
We can drive there in two minutes.

331
00:34:45,927 --> 00:34:48,122
You have no idea
what they're capable of.

332
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:51,246
Elaine, I know you're scared, OK?
We're all scared.

333
00:34:51,408 --> 00:34:53,967
But I’m not burying my head in the sand
and hoping this goes away.

334
00:34:54,128 --> 00:34:56,197
- I’m not saying that.
- Just take it easy, man.

335
00:34:56,368 --> 00:34:58,518
- There's nothing easy about this!
- I understand...

336
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:01,407
They're in the fucking building!

337
00:35:01,568 --> 00:35:04,685
- Terry...
- It’s the timer.

338
00:35:04,848 --> 00:35:06,840
[Denise] Oh, my God.

339
00:35:13,168 --> 00:35:15,683
Shit.

340
00:35:17,809 --> 00:35:20,198
[Terry] All right. Go, go, go! Move!

341
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:36,249
Shh.

342
00:36:28,413 --> 00:36:31,962
- You're disgusting.
- What the hell's the matter with you?

343
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:42,409
- We'll talk about that later.
- Yeah, we will talk about that.

344
00:36:51,254 --> 00:36:55,452
- Still wanna stay?
- I don't want any of this.

345
00:36:55,614 --> 00:36:58,048
But it didn't see us or hear us.

346
00:36:58,214 --> 00:37:01,048
- So if we stay here and stay quiet...
- [Terry] For how long?

347
00:37:01,215 --> 00:37:03,967
They're taking people out there,
plain and simple.

348
00:37:04,135 --> 00:37:06,968
The further we get out of the city,
the better off we are.

349
00:37:07,695 --> 00:37:10,528
- He's right.
- Jarrod.

350
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,208
If we get to the boat, we have a chance.

351
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:14,411
- Yeah, but we don't...
- We have to...

352
00:37:18,656 --> 00:37:20,294
We have to try.

353
00:37:20,456 --> 00:37:25,610
Get your stuff.
Pack food and water. Let's do this.

354
00:37:39,897 --> 00:37:42,252
[Terry] Let's go.

355
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,052
All right, come on.

356
00:38:05,218 --> 00:38:08,416
Look, the sooner I get there,
the sooner the boat's ready to go.

357
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:10,012
Right here.

358
00:38:10,179 --> 00:38:11,611
- Hey.
- Come on, let's go.

359
00:38:11,778 --> 00:38:13,178
- What...
- What are you doing?

360
00:38:13,339 --> 00:38:16,570
Driving. I know the way.
Why don't you take your slut?

361
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:18,695
Candice.

362
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:20,087
Candice.

363
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:23,378
Get in the car.

364
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,136
Terry, I’m sorry.

365
00:39:09,662 --> 00:39:12,130
- Hurry up.
- What do you think I’m doing?

366
00:39:17,023 --> 00:39:18,341
- Hey, slow down.
- No.

367
00:39:18,503 --> 00:39:20,458
Just stop.

368
00:39:21,342 --> 00:39:23,776
- You need any help?
- No, just go. We're fine.

369
00:39:23,942 --> 00:39:28,221
- Yeah, but maybe he can help us.
- Enough, all right? I said we're fine.

370
00:39:47,624 --> 00:39:49,615
Terry!

371
00:39:59,585 --> 00:40:00,813
Terry, get up!

372
00:40:07,185 --> 00:40:09,938
- Terry! Terry!
- My God! Terry!

373
00:40:19,826 --> 00:40:21,817
I got you!

374
00:40:26,946 --> 00:40:29,744
Jarrod, get your ass back in here now!

375
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:32,337
Drive! Drive now!

376
00:40:38,667 --> 00:40:41,545
- [man] What are you doing?
- [woman] Get in the car.

377
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:50,024
[Jarrod] Come on! Come on!

378
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:59,507
Open! Oh, shit!

379
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:02,262
- [Elaine] Come on!
- Open! God!

380
00:41:02,428 --> 00:41:04,020
Come on.

381
00:41:06,988 --> 00:41:08,979
[Candice] Open, you piece of shit!

382
00:41:12,149 --> 00:41:15,425
Back up! Back up! Back up! Go!

383
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,699
[screams] Oh, my God!

384
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:42,431
Help me! Help me!

385
00:41:42,591 --> 00:41:44,582
[screams]

386
00:41:45,191 --> 00:41:47,658
- Help me!
- [Elaine] This way!

387
00:41:50,431 --> 00:41:53,423
Candice, where's the key?
Candice, the key! Turn the key!

388
00:42:15,392 --> 00:42:17,384
[woman] Oh, my God.

389
00:42:26,193 --> 00:42:28,388
- You all right?
- I’m OK.

390
00:42:28,553 --> 00:42:31,431
- Hm.
- Oh, my God.

391
00:42:32,914 --> 00:42:34,790
- Oh, my God!
- Miss, we have to go.

392
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:36,272
No, he...

393
00:42:37,594 --> 00:42:39,311
He's alive!

394
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:40,622
God!

395
00:42:42,794 --> 00:42:44,307
Help me!

396
00:42:55,555 --> 00:42:57,910
[screaming]

397
00:43:02,075 --> 00:43:04,873
Come on, let's go!

398
00:43:05,035 --> 00:43:06,071
Oh, my God!

399
00:43:11,115 --> 00:43:13,584
Go! Go!

400
00:43:29,597 --> 00:43:31,588
Make for the back door.

401
00:43:41,197 --> 00:43:42,551
Run!

402
00:44:12,879 --> 00:44:14,995
Move!

403
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,550
Go!

404
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,595
Don't stop!

405
00:44:40,401 --> 00:44:42,392
Open the door!

406
00:44:49,201 --> 00:44:50,554
- Get it open!
- Back up.

407
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:52,598
Open it!

408
00:44:55,441 --> 00:44:57,272
Come on!

409
00:45:02,762 --> 00:45:05,481
- Where are we going?
- All the way to the top.

410
00:45:05,642 --> 00:45:08,156
- The safest place I could think of.
- We were just up there.

411
00:45:08,322 --> 00:45:10,233
[crashing]

412
00:45:10,403 --> 00:45:14,191
You wanna stay down here with that,
be my guest. Go on. Let's go.

413
00:45:18,602 --> 00:45:21,036
Come on, quickly, quickly, quickly.

414
00:46:07,646 --> 00:46:08,964
[Elaine] Jarrod...

415
00:46:09,126 --> 00:46:11,117
I should have held onto him.

416
00:46:18,926 --> 00:46:21,885
Hey. Come help me with this.

417
00:46:39,888 --> 00:46:41,879
It’s better than nothing, right?

418
00:46:42,768 --> 00:46:44,759
Yeah, if you say so.

419
00:46:46,328 --> 00:46:50,037
What are you doing, huh?
Like it or not, this is happening.

420
00:46:52,888 --> 00:46:54,879
You gotta be strong.

421
00:47:02,969 --> 00:47:04,846
Is everybody OK?

422
00:47:07,209 --> 00:47:08,403
Are you hurt?

423
00:47:09,529 --> 00:47:12,168
- No.
- I’m OK.

424
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:25,084
- What now?
- We stay here. We keep watch.

425
00:47:25,249 --> 00:47:28,367
- And we pray that someone comes.
- He's right.

426
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:32,560
Someone's gonna come.
This can't go on forever.

427
00:47:34,211 --> 00:47:35,803
Right?

428
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:45,806
- Elaine...
- It’s best if we stay together.

429
00:47:45,971 --> 00:47:48,360
I can't. The smoke.

430
00:47:49,611 --> 00:47:52,603
Given the circumstances,
I think a smoke is more than reasonable.

431
00:47:52,771 --> 00:47:54,763
Candice...

432
00:47:57,012 --> 00:47:59,242
I’m pregnant, all right?

433
00:48:00,212 --> 00:48:02,680
And I just thought that...

434
00:48:02,852 --> 00:48:04,843
...between all the stress...

435
00:48:10,413 --> 00:48:12,404
It’s OK.

436
00:48:16,053 --> 00:48:18,282
I never even got to tell my mom.

437
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:32,442
Come on, boss.
Let's let the girls get some sleep.

438
00:48:32,613 --> 00:48:34,604
You and I will keep watch.

439
00:48:36,374 --> 00:48:37,807
Both of us?

440
00:48:37,974 --> 00:48:42,093
They try that light stuff,
we got each other's back.

441
00:49:03,695 --> 00:49:05,687
I hate LA.

442
00:49:33,697 --> 00:49:36,211
I haven't seen a soul all night.

443
00:49:38,898 --> 00:49:41,411
Maybe the worst is over.

444
00:49:41,577 --> 00:49:43,772
Maybe not.

445
00:49:46,218 --> 00:49:49,176
What do you think
those things really are?

446
00:49:49,338 --> 00:49:51,408
I don't know.

447
00:49:51,578 --> 00:49:53,569
Does it even matter?

448
00:49:58,498 --> 00:49:59,931
It just doesn't seems real.

449
00:50:03,698 --> 00:50:05,849
Well, it is real.

450
00:50:06,019 --> 00:50:08,010
You better wake up.

451
00:50:10,379 --> 00:50:14,213
- What's that supposed to mean?
- The city's a vacant lot.

452
00:50:14,379 --> 00:50:16,370
We need to survive.

453
00:50:18,779 --> 00:50:21,135
There's not gonna be many of us left.

454
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,691
[clattering]

455
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,612
[crashing]

456
00:50:42,101 --> 00:50:43,932
Let me see.

457
00:50:46,701 --> 00:50:48,294
Somebody's fighting back.

458
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:53,970
- What are you doing?
- I wanna see what's out there.

459
00:50:57,422 --> 00:50:58,855
[Elaine] Oh, my God.

460
00:51:07,102 --> 00:51:09,059
Turn that off. It’s too bright.

461
00:51:09,223 --> 00:51:11,100
- No.
- We can't risk it.

462
00:51:13,903 --> 00:51:15,621
[Elaine] Oh, my God.

463
00:52:08,466 --> 00:52:10,457
Did you sleep at all?

464
00:52:15,546 --> 00:52:18,902
- Is it getting worse?
- What?

465
00:52:19,066 --> 00:52:20,944
The marks on your skin.

466
00:52:22,867 --> 00:52:26,176
When I looked in that light,
I couldn't stand for ten minutes.

467
00:52:26,347 --> 00:52:28,577
Who knows what it did to us?

468
00:52:33,428 --> 00:52:34,655
To our bodies.

469
00:52:44,388 --> 00:52:48,939
You remember that first moment when you
saw it, when it completely took over?

470
00:52:49,828 --> 00:52:52,900
Somehow you... you still felt...

471
00:52:56,988 --> 00:52:58,979
...powerful.

472
00:53:04,669 --> 00:53:06,660
I still do.

473
00:54:18,993 --> 00:54:21,632
Why don't you take a seat, relax?

474
00:54:33,114 --> 00:54:38,711
All right, I’ll bite. What's your plan,
boss? I know you're dying to tell me.

475
00:54:41,954 --> 00:54:43,103
Nothing to say?

476
00:54:44,274 --> 00:54:46,072
We're sitting on the marina
for Christ's sakes.

477
00:54:46,235 --> 00:54:47,223
I’ve noticed that.

478
00:54:47,395 --> 00:54:49,306
There are hundreds of boats
right across the street.

479
00:54:49,475 --> 00:54:51,226
We've been through all this.

480
00:54:51,395 --> 00:54:53,351
Remind us
how that worked out last time.

481
00:54:59,276 --> 00:55:00,993
We go quietly this time.

482
00:55:01,155 --> 00:55:03,544
And search every boat
till we find the key?

483
00:55:03,716 --> 00:55:06,628
- If we have to.
- Great plan, Jarrod.

484
00:55:07,716 --> 00:55:10,913
I can't believe you'd even suggest that
after what happened.

485
00:55:11,076 --> 00:55:13,466
You make it sound like it was my fault.

486
00:55:13,636 --> 00:55:18,346
I was practically begging,
but you wouldn't listen.

487
00:55:19,116 --> 00:55:21,711
And you think Terry
would have listened to me?

488
00:55:24,397 --> 00:55:26,388
All right.

489
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:30,630
Let's say we make it
out of the building,

490
00:55:30,797 --> 00:55:34,312
across the marina, down the dock,
we even find the boat and everything.

491
00:55:34,477 --> 00:55:36,275
Then what?

492
00:55:36,438 --> 00:55:40,749
- Then we get the hell out of Dodge.
- Where to? Carolina? Down the coast?

493
00:55:40,918 --> 00:55:43,716
- Anywhere is better than here.
- How do you know?

494
00:55:43,878 --> 00:55:47,348
We're here. We're alive.

495

[jet engines]

496
00:55:49,798 --> 00:55:51,789
What was that?

497
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,594
What do you see?

498
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:03,157
Hallelujah.

499
00:57:14,603 --> 00:57:16,753
[man] Come on, come on, come on.

- Everybody get down!

502
00:57:58,326 --> 00:57:59,918
[Elaine] Jarrod?

503
00:58:00,086 --> 00:58:02,077
Lainey?

504
00:59:01,769 --> 00:59:02,758
It worked.

505
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:11,927
I don't believe it. Is it over?

506
00:59:12,089 --> 00:59:14,126
It worked. It worked.

507
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:17,362
- Do you mind?
- [man] By all means, boss.

508
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:28,929
[Elaine] Do you think there are
more planes where they came from?

509
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:34,529
Yes. Now they know what to do,
they'll be sending help in no time.

510
00:59:45,572 --> 00:59:46,560
What?

511
00:59:48,132 --> 00:59:50,725
- What is it?
- They're not dead.

512
00:59:52,052 --> 00:59:55,931
They're just really, really pissed off.

513
01:00:20,213 --> 01:00:22,205
Something is happening.

514
01:00:34,934 --> 01:00:37,209
We got to cover these windows.

515
01:00:38,175 --> 01:00:40,245
Come help me with this.

516
01:00:40,414 --> 01:00:43,771
- Get back over here!
- Look, I’ll find something.

517
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:51,254
Here.

518
01:00:57,776 --> 01:01:00,370
Jarrod, what are you doing?

519
01:01:00,536 --> 01:01:02,527
The only thing we can do.

520
01:01:09,417 --> 01:01:11,691
What's this really about, huh?

521
01:01:12,616 --> 01:01:14,608
Those things are coming for us.

522
01:01:15,777 --> 01:01:19,213
You think I haven't noticed
that mess under your shirt?

523
01:01:19,377 --> 01:01:22,369
We stay here and hold up for good.

524
01:01:23,417 --> 01:01:25,487
I agree.

525
01:01:25,657 --> 01:01:29,856
Now he gets to decide everything?
We have no water, no power.

526
01:01:30,018 --> 01:01:31,814
Yeah, but you saw what's out there.

527
01:01:31,977 --> 01:01:35,607
Yeah, and I would rather make a run
for it than stay in a 20-storey target.

528
01:01:35,778 --> 01:01:39,327
Between those things and the radiation,
we are dead up here.

529
01:01:39,498 --> 01:01:42,059
[helicopter overhead]

Go, go, go, go! Cover the flanks!

532
01:01:54,499 --> 01:01:56,410
Look.

533
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:58,217
- Get off me!
- What do you think you're doing?

534
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:00,688
- We have to let 'em know we're here.
- We'll let everything know.

535
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:03,657
You've been saying to wait for help.
Well, help is here.

536
01:02:04,899 --> 01:02:09,131
Does that look like a rescue chopper
to you? Don't you get it? We're at war.

537
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:13,131
Where are they going?

538
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:22,977
Those choppers are coming back for them.
We have to go. Come on.

539
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:30,054
We'll get to the roof.
They'll pick us up.

540
01:02:30,221 --> 01:02:33,213
What if they don't come back?
Look what happened to those planes.

541
01:02:33,381 --> 01:02:35,690
- What good is a helicopter?
- We have to take a chance.

542
01:02:35,861 --> 01:02:39,980
A chance? They just nuked the city.
And you wanna wave hello?

543
01:02:40,141 --> 01:02:42,815
Seriously, you need to back off.
We have to...

544
01:02:43,542 --> 01:02:45,533
[Candice] Oh, shit.

545
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,536
You just gonna stand there?

546
01:02:47,702 --> 01:02:52,014
What happens when the rest of the blinds
fall? We don't have enough bed sheets.

547
01:02:52,862 --> 01:02:55,252
- Come on.
- How can you be so sure?

548
01:02:55,422 --> 01:02:57,014
Let's just go.

549
01:02:57,182 --> 01:02:59,094
You're in no condition
to decide anything.

550
01:02:59,262 --> 01:03:01,493
Who knows what side you're on?

551
01:03:01,663 --> 01:03:02,857
I’m warning you...

552
01:03:03,023 --> 01:03:06,140
[Elaine] Stop it, both of you!

Look at his face. He's sick.

- Don't make me hurt you.
- Oh, don't worry.

555
01:03:24,704 --> 01:03:27,138
I am not leaving here without my family.

556
01:03:29,024 --> 01:03:32,812
And there is nothing
that you can do to stop us.

557
01:03:35,825 --> 01:03:37,816
Lainey, you have to trust me.

558
01:03:47,545 --> 01:03:49,183
It’s me.

559
01:03:57,466 --> 01:04:00,219
It’s still... me.

560
01:04:07,866 --> 01:04:09,857
I know.

561
01:04:14,186 --> 01:04:16,177
We have to go.

Right there.

- Don't shoot!
