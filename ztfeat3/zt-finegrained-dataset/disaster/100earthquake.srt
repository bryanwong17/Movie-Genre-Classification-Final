1
00:00:28,693 --> 00:00:32,064
Come on, Hicks.

2
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:36,235
This is for your
all-time best.

3
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:42,642
Yay.

4
00:00:42,674 --> 00:00:46,611
I'm the champion,
the champion!

5
00:00:46,645 --> 00:00:48,214
Yes!

6
00:00:48,246 --> 00:00:49,269
Yes!

7
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,483
I gotta call Margaret.

8
00:00:51,517 --> 00:00:53,286
Come on!

9
00:01:10,602 --> 00:01:11,870
Hey, hey, hey.

10
00:01:11,903 --> 00:01:13,206
What's going...
What's going on?

11
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,640
The pressure's
through the roof.

12
00:01:14,673 --> 00:01:16,242
We've got
elevated methane.

13
00:01:17,376 --> 00:01:19,412
We've got to go down
and vent the pumps.

14
00:01:30,221 --> 00:01:31,524
-Give me a boost.
-Yeah, yeah.

15
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:37,263
Yeow!

16
00:01:37,296 --> 00:01:38,331
Damn.

17
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:39,365
You okay? You okay?

18
00:01:40,498 --> 00:01:41,867
Empty out the pipes.

19
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,735
Turn off the lights!

20
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:45,105
<i>The lights!</i>

21
00:01:50,808 --> 00:01:53,646
Damn,
we punctured the crust.

22
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:55,347
We drilled way too deep!

23
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,250
What is that?

24
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,650
-What is that?
-Look out!

25
00:02:01,653 --> 00:02:03,221
God!

26
00:02:03,254 --> 00:02:06,224
Well, I'd say
I owe you one.

27
00:02:06,257 --> 00:02:07,626
We're going to have to
turn off the valve

28
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:08,927
on the pressure
relief valve.

29
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:10,362
Yeah.

30
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:11,697
Come on!

31
00:02:18,804 --> 00:02:21,608
Holy crap!

32
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:39,558
Come on, come on,
come on!

33
00:02:42,493 --> 00:02:43,429
Good.

34
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:44,763
Move it, move it,
move it!

35
00:02:44,796 --> 00:02:45,764
Go!

36
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:50,937
Come on, move it.

37
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:52,337
Go! Go!

38
00:02:54,473 --> 00:02:56,409
No!

39
00:03:00,712 --> 00:03:02,715
Forget it, man.
Come on!

40
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,320
Come on!

41
00:03:11,556 --> 00:03:13,692
Don't give up, buddy!

42
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:15,627
Come on!

43
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:53,459
<i>No word yet from the USGS,</i>

44
00:04:53,492 --> 00:04:54,927
<i>but we've had three calls
from Long Beach</i>

45
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,995
<i>about a little shake tonight.</i>

46
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:57,362
<i>Come on, kids.</i>

47
00:04:57,396 --> 00:04:59,398
<i>This is L.A.
Get used to it.</i>

48
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,832
<i>Now back to your daily run</i>

49
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:02,834
<i>of your favorite
L.A. music.</i>

50
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,125
All right,
now look to your left.

51
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:28,661
<i>My left or yours?</i>

52
00:05:28,694 --> 00:05:30,062
I don't know
which way you're facing!

53
00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:30,996
<i>I don't see anything.</i>

54
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,467
<i>I don't see
any camping stuff.</i>

55
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,769
It's, it's behind the box
marked Christmas.

56
00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:38,804
-There's Christmas stuff, behind it.
-Hello.

57
00:05:38,836 --> 00:05:41,940
Hey. I thought you weren't picking
her up until later this evening.

58
00:05:41,973 --> 00:05:44,476
I just wanted to see if she wanted
to hang out with the old man.

59
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:45,644
<i>Mom, I don't see any...
Okay.</i>

60
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:47,112
<i>-I found it.
-Okay, good.</i>

61
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,646
<i>-What's she looking for?
-Heads up!</i>

62
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,449
Wait! Going camping?

63
00:05:50,482 --> 00:05:53,052
<i>Me, with Cindy. Crap.
She's gonna be here any minute.</i>

64
00:05:53,084 --> 00:05:55,987
Hey, I thought
we had plans for tonight.

65
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:58,591
Do you really think Pizza and
Redbox qualifies as plans?

66
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,893
<i>Sorry, Dad. We'll do something
next week, okay?</i>

67
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:02,394
No, no, it's not okay.

68
00:06:02,427 --> 00:06:03,596
You can't just, you know,

69
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,097
cancel on someone
at the last minute.

70
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:06,432
Really?

71
00:06:06,464 --> 00:06:07,866
Hey, just tell
Cindy's parents

72
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:09,534
that you've made a commitment
and that we are...

73
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:10,969
<i>Her parents aren't going!</i>

74
00:06:11,002 --> 00:06:12,137
<i>Ma, I can't find the tent.</i>

75
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,639
Well, it's up there...
somewhere.

76
00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:16,975
Wait. Hang on a second. There's no
chaperone, did you know about this?

77
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,645
What do you want her to do? Sit around and
pray that you don't stand her up again?

78
00:06:19,677 --> 00:06:21,713
She's got her own life,
you know.

79
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:24,516
Yeah and I would appreciate not
being cut out of it completely.

80
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,186
It's three days in a national park.
They'll be fine.

81
00:06:27,218 --> 00:06:29,154
Hey, you want to go camping?
Hey, that's great.

82
00:06:29,187 --> 00:06:30,555
You know,
I'm going to be up there.

83
00:06:30,588 --> 00:06:31,757
I'm breaking ground
at Station Five.

84
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,559
You can hang out
with your old man.

85
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:34,692
<i>Pass.</i>

86
00:06:34,726 --> 00:06:37,195
Look, it is dangerous up there
in the woods, you know.

87
00:06:37,228 --> 00:06:40,532
What would you do
if you ran into bears?

88
00:06:40,565 --> 00:06:42,133
<i>Never sleep in their beds,</i>

89
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,502
<i>sit in their chairs,
or eat their porridge.</i>

90
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:47,139
Look, I'm not
comfortable with this.

91
00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:48,741
Two girls alone
in the woods...

92
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:50,942
<i>Derrick and his friends
will be there.</i>

93
00:06:50,975 --> 00:06:54,512
Hang on. There's boys?
That is worse than bears.

94
00:06:54,545 --> 00:06:55,647
You, you knew about this?

95
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,981
Dad!

96
00:06:57,014 --> 00:06:58,550
You have to trust me.

97
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,153
You know I can
take care of myself.

98
00:07:01,185 --> 00:07:03,788
Okay.

99
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:04,956
Thanks, Dad.

100
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,526
Just promise me...

101
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,495
If you run into your grandmother
wearing a nightie,

102
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:13,798
just double check...
Might be a wolf.

103
00:07:13,831 --> 00:07:14,966
Sure thing, Dad.

104
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,101
Plus, grandma's way furrier,

105
00:07:17,134 --> 00:07:18,570
and she has thumbs!

106
00:07:20,572 --> 00:07:22,442
All right.
Do you have your checklist?

107
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:40,225
Could be nothing.

108
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,028
Probably nothing.

109
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:45,865
Okay.

110
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:56,775
And now it's something.

111
00:08:07,586 --> 00:08:09,855
Dr. Gladstone,
a delightful surprise.

112
00:08:09,887 --> 00:08:12,024
How many calls
have we had this morning?

113
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:14,727
Just eight.

114
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,661
No, I haven't seen
last night's seismographs.

115
00:08:16,694 --> 00:08:18,029
I haven't even had
a cup of cof...

116
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:19,697
God!

117
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:23,302
Doc,
it's my first day.

118
00:08:23,334 --> 00:08:25,169
Can't we just...

119
00:08:25,202 --> 00:08:27,005
The L.A. basin
always shows signs

120
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:29,307
of deep crust activity
when...

121
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:33,678
Intensifying aftershocks?
Pre-shocks?

122
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:35,246
Don't you think
that's a little farfetched?

123
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,315
Okay, I'll...
I'll look into it.

124
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:39,084
Doc, I'll look into it.

125
00:08:39,116 --> 00:08:40,051
I promise.

126
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,732
Drunk as could be.

127
00:08:54,765 --> 00:08:56,735
Looks the broad
right in the face and says,

128
00:08:56,768 --> 00:08:57,870
"If that's not a banana,

129
00:08:57,903 --> 00:08:59,904
What's it doing
in my cornflakes?"

130
00:09:01,606 --> 00:09:02,875
Who wants more champagne?

131
00:09:04,308 --> 00:09:05,810
We're out!

132
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,726
Don't start without me!

133
00:09:25,163 --> 00:09:26,365
I've got the bubbles.

134
00:09:26,398 --> 00:09:28,801
Who's ready
for the...?

135
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,240
<i>-Nice car.
-Thanks.</i>

136
00:09:36,274 --> 00:09:39,845
You,
you checked the fluids?

137
00:09:39,878 --> 00:09:41,146
Yep, changed the oil
this week.

138
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,284
What about these? When's the
last time you had them rotated?

139
00:09:46,317 --> 00:09:48,252
I think
three months ago.

140
00:09:48,285 --> 00:09:49,988
You think,
or you know?

141
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:50,890
I know.

142
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,825
The receipts are in
the glove compartment.

143
00:09:55,092 --> 00:09:56,260
What's in the cooler?

144
00:09:56,293 --> 00:09:58,963
Just food and soda, sir.

145
00:09:58,996 --> 00:10:00,198
Better be!

146
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:03,736
Hey.

147
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,304
Damn, Nicki.
Your dad is way protective.

148
00:10:06,337 --> 00:10:09,073
Well, this weekend
he might have a reason to be.

149
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:12,677
-What, what are you planning?
-Nothing!

150
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:13,762
Mind your business.

151
00:10:13,763 --> 00:10:14,812
Is it something dangerous?

152
00:10:14,846 --> 00:10:16,932
My God!

153
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:19,018
If, if it is, then we should
all be informed of it.

154
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,152
Do you have firearms?

155
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:21,819
-No.
-Of course not!

156
00:10:21,852 --> 00:10:23,855
Fireworks? They can be lethal...
Especially in the forest.

157
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,658
You know, Southern California
has very dry summers.

158
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,926
Shut it, Toblosky,
or we're leaving you behind.

159
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,261
You better not be blabbing the
whole way or so help me, God,

160
00:10:30,294 --> 00:10:32,264
I will just dump your ass
in the middle of the desert,

161
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:33,766
and I don't care
if you're paying for gas.

162
00:10:33,798 --> 00:10:35,167
-I'm not putting up with it.
-Okay, Warner.

163
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,835
God!

164
00:10:36,868 --> 00:10:37,970
-Jeez!
-This is ridiculous!

165
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:39,738
Your dad is a mammoth
pain in the ass.

166
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,240
What is he like...
A Scottish Mountie or something?

167
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,409
He's an engineer
for a fracking company.

168
00:10:44,442 --> 00:10:46,077
What the frack is fracking?

169
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,146
It's actually very cool...
And very controversial.

170
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:49,747
You know,
what they do is they...

171
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,083
They drill like a mile down
into the earth's crust

172
00:10:52,116 --> 00:10:54,687
looking for, you know,
natural gases and oil.

173
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,788
Then when they find it,
they drill sideways

174
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,423
and let off
a series of explosions

175
00:10:58,456 --> 00:10:59,891
and finally
they force it out

176
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:03,327
with millions of gallons
of pressurized water.

177
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,297
What did I just say?

178
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,732
Well, we're not driving!

179
00:11:06,764 --> 00:11:08,399
<i>Okay. Calm down.</i>

180
00:11:08,432 --> 00:11:10,068
Jeez, Warner.

181
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:14,306
Ok, I think
we're ready to go.

182
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:15,307
Awesome!

183
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,776
Hey...
Okay.

184
00:11:17,808 --> 00:11:20,778
I will be right up there
if you want to see the rig...

185
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:24,450
7 p.m.-that's when
we're turning all the pumps on.

186
00:11:24,482 --> 00:11:25,783
It's going to be
quite a sight.

187
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:27,418
Yeah, we'll be sure
to stop by.

188
00:11:27,451 --> 00:11:29,053
Can we please go now?

189
00:11:29,086 --> 00:11:30,923
One last question...

190
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,125
How many beers before
it's no longer safe to drive?

191
00:11:33,158 --> 00:11:35,060
Dad! Derrick,
don't answer that question.

192
00:11:35,092 --> 00:11:36,394
<i>Well, actually
it's the blood alcohol...</i>

193
00:11:36,427 --> 00:11:39,097
Hey, I'm asking him,
not you.

194
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,365
Come on, tough guy.

195
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:41,466
-Nothing.
-One beer.

196
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,168
No.
Wrong!

197
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:44,436
You're under 21.

198
00:11:44,469 --> 00:11:45,804
That's it, young lady.
Out of the car!

199
00:11:45,836 --> 00:11:47,272
Come on. No.

200
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,707
Dad, stop it!

201
00:11:53,845 --> 00:11:55,413
All right. You just...

202
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:59,083
You call me if there's
any problems, okay?

203
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:00,284
No trouble, you hear?

204
00:12:00,317 --> 00:12:01,385
Yes, sir.

205
00:12:01,418 --> 00:12:02,954
<i>Thanks, Dad.</i>

206
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,324
Bye.

207
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,094
Sorry.

208
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:12,964
Too possessive Jack.
You keep it up,

209
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,100
you're going to
push her away even more.

210
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:18,537
It's just the dysfunctional stuff.
Am I too involved or not enough?

211
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:22,975
Being overprotective isn't
the same as being supportive.

212
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:25,043
You've got to start
trusting her.

213
00:12:25,076 --> 00:12:27,946
What about that GPS tracking
app that you put in her cell?

214
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:29,314
Yeah, but that's different.

215
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:30,348
Really?

216
00:12:30,381 --> 00:12:32,116
Yeah.

217
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:33,251
Hey, yeah.

218
00:12:33,284 --> 00:12:34,852
Hey, boss. Yeah.

219
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:36,855
I'm I'm running
a little bit late.

220
00:12:36,888 --> 00:12:40,057
I've just got to pick up Hector
and I'll be on my way.

221
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:41,793
Before you head there,
I need you to stop by

222
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:43,261
Pump Station Three.

223
00:12:43,294 --> 00:12:44,529
We've got a little spike,

224
00:12:44,562 --> 00:12:46,298
<i>then the station went dead.</i>

225
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:47,566
<i>We lost all our readings.</i>

226
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,268
Come on, move it!
Let's go!

227
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,502
<i>Come on, move it!</i>

228
00:12:50,534 --> 00:12:52,937
Okay, yeah,
wha-what about Paxton?

229
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:54,405
<i>Yeah, I haven't heard back.</i>

230
00:12:54,438 --> 00:12:57,408
He pulled an all-nighter
so he's probably crashed out.

231
00:12:57,442 --> 00:12:59,010
<i>What is your problem?</i>

232
00:12:59,043 --> 00:13:01,245
Today, please!
Today!

233
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:02,581
Yeah, and security?

234
00:13:02,614 --> 00:13:04,583
<i>That drunk is probably
passed out, too.</i>

235
00:13:04,615 --> 00:13:06,585
<i>He's as big of an idiot
as this moron</i>

236
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:08,086
in front of me.

237
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:09,288
Move it, toots!

238
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:13,057
It's not like Paxton
not to check in, though.

239
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:15,894
This is L.A., 55 means 70.

240
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:17,329
Pick it up, Grandma!

241
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,033
Ho, nice!

242
00:13:28,306 --> 00:13:30,375
Hey, Jack, I'll see you
this afternoon.

243
00:13:30,408 --> 00:13:31,610
It's a big day, man.

244
00:13:31,643 --> 00:13:34,046
I can't wait
'til we turn on...

245
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:36,948
Would you
look at this guy?

246
00:13:36,981 --> 00:13:38,583
Stay in your lane, idiot!

247
00:13:40,585 --> 00:13:42,187
Listen, I've,
I've got to go.

248
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,488
Sounds like it's going to be
one of those days.

249
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,089
Sorry.

250
00:13:45,123 --> 00:13:50,028
Yeah, sorry to pile it on,
but could you just sign this

251
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:52,398
and mail it in
whenever you can?

252
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,900
Sure.

253
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:02,206
Hello?

254
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,876
Hi. I'm looking
for Dr. Booker.

255
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:08,145
Could you, point me
in the right direction?

256
00:14:08,178 --> 00:14:10,348
Hello?

257
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:13,251
Hello?
Mi-Miss?

258
00:14:13,284 --> 00:14:14,352
Hi there.

259
00:14:14,385 --> 00:14:15,353
Dr. Schiffman.

260
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,222
Not Dr. Schiffman.

261
00:14:18,255 --> 00:14:20,424
Yes. It's the second time
I've been called doctor today.

262
00:14:20,457 --> 00:14:22,394
I'm not quite used to it.

263
00:14:22,427 --> 00:14:23,512
Emily's fine, sir.

264
00:14:23,513 --> 00:14:24,596
Michael.

265
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:26,298
I will show you
around here.

266
00:14:26,331 --> 00:14:27,499
Am I early?

267
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:29,100
What time does
everyone show up?

268
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,637
I'm afraid this is it.
Budget cuts, you know?

269
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:33,437
I'm actually a little surprised
they hired you,

270
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,674
although I can use the company
and the help, especially today.

271
00:14:36,707 --> 00:14:39,144
This has been
a very funny morning.

272
00:14:39,177 --> 00:14:41,013
We've had 15 reports
since last night

273
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,514
and I can't make
a lick of sense of it.

274
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:44,582
So I've heard.

275
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:45,616
Gladstone.

276
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:47,084
Yeah.
I met him last year

277
00:14:47,118 --> 00:14:48,987
at a paleo-earthquake
seminar at Berkley

278
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,155
and somehow I became
his new best friend.

279
00:14:51,188 --> 00:14:53,024
Yeah, that guy...
He's like a mutt...

280
00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:54,326
You pet him once,
he never leaves your lap.

281
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:56,528
He heard my thesis
and he had to meet me!

282
00:14:56,561 --> 00:14:58,663
<i>Yes, I read that thesis.</i>

283
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,365
It was on containment...

284
00:15:00,398 --> 00:15:01,500
-Epicenter.
-Yeah.

285
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,032
Epicenter containment, yeah.

286
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:04,468
-Yeah, it was quite...
-Ridiculous?

287
00:15:04,501 --> 00:15:05,569
No, I wasn't
going to say that.

288
00:15:05,602 --> 00:15:07,072
No, it's okay,

289
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:08,507
my, my professors
thought the same thing.

290
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:11,575
However, that ingenious theory
did earn me a strong C minus.

291
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:14,480
And a job
at the glorious USGS.

292
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,716
Yeah, you know,
you would think the state

293
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,952
would make this place
more of a priority.

294
00:15:20,985 --> 00:15:23,322
Well, I do have a 24-hour
hotline to the governor

295
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:24,389
anytime I need it.

296
00:15:24,422 --> 00:15:26,158
Really?
What's he like?

297
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,560
I've never met him, so...

298
00:15:28,592 --> 00:15:32,496
Also, there is the sign-up sheet
for the company softball league.

299
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:35,433
So far it's just me.

300
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:37,269
I play first base.

301
00:15:37,302 --> 00:15:39,204
-Okay.
-Yeah.

302
00:15:39,236 --> 00:15:42,307
Here's the rules for using
the kitchen microwave,

303
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,575
dah-dah, dah, dah.

304
00:15:43,607 --> 00:15:46,644
And over here
is your workstation.

305
00:15:46,677 --> 00:15:49,480
Now, we have been getting
calls all morning

306
00:15:49,514 --> 00:15:51,048
about tremor activity, okay?

307
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:53,317
Nothing major,
no major damage...

308
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,586
Just broken glass,
things flying off the shelves.

309
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,489
The thing is,
the major scales...

310
00:15:57,522 --> 00:16:00,057
They haven't registered anything
above a semi passing by.

311
00:16:00,091 --> 00:16:01,360
Okay,
so what can I do?

312
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:04,997
Well, we have 300 sensors
in the L.A. river basin.

313
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:07,031
These reports are from
the last 12 hours.

314
00:16:07,065 --> 00:16:08,166
I'm gonna need you
to look through there,

315
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:10,334
see if there's
any unusual peaks.

316
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:13,437
Is this some sort of
new-guy hazing?

317
00:16:13,471 --> 00:16:15,240
Don't you have some intern

318
00:16:15,273 --> 00:16:19,110
or a computer
equipped to do this?

319
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,679
We barely have enough money
for staples for this stapler.

320
00:16:23,514 --> 00:16:25,049
I shouldn't
have used that one.

321
00:16:25,082 --> 00:16:27,552
Sorry, kid.
Just you and me, honey.

322
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,269
Dude!

323
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,052
Dude?

324
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:38,823
<i>Nate down in Palms.</i>

325
00:17:38,856 --> 00:17:40,692
<i>Callers told us a big sinkhole
just opened up</i>

326
00:17:40,724 --> 00:17:41,826
<i>right in the middle of
Robertson.</i>

327
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:43,494
<i>Check this out, though.</i>

328
00:17:43,528 --> 00:17:45,163
<i>Got a call from a guy dining
across the street</i>

329
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:46,363
<i>who says
he didn't feel a thing.</i>

330
00:17:46,396 --> 00:17:48,299
-That's the third one today.
-Yeah.

331
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,601
<i>We've got
the Twiggies coming up next.</i>

332
00:17:49,634 --> 00:17:50,701
<i>So stick around.</i>

333
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:51,869
Hey.

334
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:53,771
You got your release
papers?

335
00:17:53,805 --> 00:17:56,141
What?
Give me that.

336
00:17:56,173 --> 00:17:58,876
The final nail
in the coffin.

337
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,779
So,
so what's the plan?

338
00:18:01,813 --> 00:18:04,783
We hitting the strip clubs
or you surfing online?

339
00:18:04,816 --> 00:18:06,384
More women?
God, no.

340
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,319
No, I've got my hands
full as it is anyway.

341
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:09,721
The little one's
on your ass, too?

342
00:18:09,753 --> 00:18:12,490
Yeah, not so little anymore.

343
00:18:12,523 --> 00:18:13,557
Eighteen.

344
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,193
Eighteen?

345
00:18:16,227 --> 00:18:18,396
So she's in that
get-away-from-me stage.

346
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:19,230
Pretty much.

347
00:18:19,262 --> 00:18:21,332
"I hate you, Dad!
Get out of my room!"

348
00:18:21,365 --> 00:18:22,334
You know it.

349
00:18:22,366 --> 00:18:24,368
"I hope you die
so I could take my inheritance,

350
00:18:24,402 --> 00:18:27,405
move to Vegas
and start whoring on a strip."

351
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,611
Went too far with that?

352
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:33,644
What is wrong with you?

353
00:18:35,246 --> 00:18:37,182
Still, not too far
off the truth, you know?

354
00:18:37,214 --> 00:18:38,916
I remember when
I used to be a hero,

355
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:42,386
and now I'm just this
annoying embarrassment.

356
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,289
You know, women.
You can't live with them...

357
00:18:52,963 --> 00:18:55,799
Still, the lady
who's really busting my balls

358
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,169
isn't Steph or Nicole.

359
00:18:57,201 --> 00:18:58,435
<i>I hear you, man.</i>

360
00:18:58,469 --> 00:19:00,372
This job is the worst bitch
I've ever known.

361
00:19:00,404 --> 00:19:02,206
Been my wife
for over two years now...

362
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,410
Two long, miserable years
of ruthless spousal abuse, man.

363
00:19:05,442 --> 00:19:07,711
Look, look,
look at these bruises.

364
00:19:07,744 --> 00:19:12,650
Well, hopefully today this
marriage pays off for both of us.

365
00:19:12,683 --> 00:19:14,302
It better.

366
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,921
It will.

367
00:19:15,953 --> 00:19:18,322
I have a very good feeling.

368
00:19:36,406 --> 00:19:39,443
<i>Next in line, fast!
Go, go.</i>

369
00:19:39,477 --> 00:19:41,947
<i>Spin around.</i>

370
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,347
<i>Okay.</i>

371
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:14,011
No, no, no, Gladstone.

372
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:17,282
We don't have that information,
but we're trying.

373
00:20:17,315 --> 00:20:18,450
You don't even know
my mother!

374
00:20:18,482 --> 00:20:19,783
There are some
serious anomalies

375
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:21,019
in the deep crust strata.

376
00:20:21,051 --> 00:20:22,721
Okay, hold on, hold on.
What did you find?

377
00:20:22,753 --> 00:20:24,321
Here.
At 2:17 this morning,

378
00:20:24,355 --> 00:20:27,025
a 2.1 with an epicenter
south of the city...

379
00:20:27,057 --> 00:20:28,259
That's just the beginning.

380
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:29,827
Do you hear that, Marcus?

381
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:30,862
What, no speakerphone?

382
00:20:30,894 --> 00:20:31,863
No money.

383
00:20:31,895 --> 00:20:34,566
2:41, 3:05, 3:56.

384
00:20:34,598 --> 00:20:36,533
They're escalating
on a graduating curve,

385
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:38,002
radiating out
from the epicenter.

386
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:41,006
The last one was 12 miles away
and twice the force.

387
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:44,643
Marcus, how reliable
is this data?

388
00:20:44,675 --> 00:20:46,410
Well, we're going to need
everything,

389
00:20:46,443 --> 00:20:47,778
especially if we're doing
what you're suggesting.

390
00:20:47,811 --> 00:20:49,980
-What, what is...
-I'm sending Emily down there.

391
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:51,649
Take her to the epicenter,
collect the data,

392
00:20:51,682 --> 00:20:53,350
compare it against
the Mercalli scale.

393
00:20:53,384 --> 00:20:54,653
But we're going to need
an eyewitness account

394
00:20:54,685 --> 00:20:56,887
if you expect me to pull
the trigger on this thing.

395
00:20:56,921 --> 00:20:58,355
What's he want you to do?

396
00:20:58,388 --> 00:20:59,824
Evacuate Los Angeles.

397
00:21:22,012 --> 00:21:23,814
Paxton!

398
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:26,550
Hicks.
Yo, where you at?

399
00:21:26,584 --> 00:21:29,587
What is that, sulphur?

400
00:21:35,593 --> 00:21:37,329
Paxton, Hicks?

401
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,732
Hey, Hector.
Check it out.

402
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:45,871
That don't look good, Chief.

403
00:21:53,678 --> 00:21:56,081
Man, we are
bringing up all kinds of stuff

404
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,583
that we shouldn't be
anywhere near drilling.

405
00:22:00,384 --> 00:22:02,921
Paxton, Hicks?

406
00:22:02,953 --> 00:22:04,489
Sure is humid down there.

407
00:22:04,521 --> 00:22:06,692
You know, humidity can
trigger an asthma attack.

408
00:22:08,492 --> 00:22:09,760
So?

409
00:22:09,794 --> 00:22:11,463
You don't have asthma.

410
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,465
It does make my hair
really frizzy.

411
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,066
You get down there!

412
00:22:15,098 --> 00:22:16,934
All right.
I'll check it out.

413
00:23:40,817 --> 00:23:41,952
That can't be right.

414
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:53,530
Glorious morning to you.

415
00:23:53,564 --> 00:23:54,999
I'm sorry.
I have the wrong...

416
00:23:55,031 --> 00:23:56,166
You're here for Marcus.

417
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,201
Come in. Come in.

418
00:23:57,234 --> 00:23:58,569
I'll take you to him.

419
00:24:01,571 --> 00:24:02,539
Can I get you an Evian?

420
00:24:02,573 --> 00:24:04,509
No. I'm fine.

421
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:06,510
My husband's been
working away all night.

422
00:24:06,544 --> 00:24:08,947
He's in a heckuva tizzy.

423
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,081
Who's your husband?

424
00:24:10,114 --> 00:24:11,583
Marcus.

425
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:14,618
This makes no sense.

426
00:24:15,752 --> 00:24:17,855
Babycakes,
your visitor's here.

427
00:24:22,026 --> 00:24:24,729
Dr. Schiffman.
Thank heavens!

428
00:24:26,864 --> 00:24:27,999
This makes sense.

429
00:24:29,133 --> 00:24:30,969
Off to save the city.

430
00:24:31,001 --> 00:24:32,002
Will you be back for dinner?

431
00:24:32,036 --> 00:24:33,571
Don't know.

432
00:24:33,604 --> 00:24:35,640
<i>Well, stop and get
cupcakes on your way home.</i>

433
00:24:35,673 --> 00:24:36,708
Cupcakes?

434
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,076
What's wrong with you, woman?

435
00:24:38,108 --> 00:24:40,144
I just said I'm off
to save Los Angeles.

436
00:24:40,176 --> 00:24:42,613
So, what?
Cheesecake?

437
00:24:43,914 --> 00:24:46,518
Yes, cheesecake.

438
00:24:51,154 --> 00:24:53,258
L.A., man...
55 means 70!

439
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,925
Stupid foreigners!

440
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:57,695
I don't think that Wisconsin's
a foreign territory.

441
00:24:57,728 --> 00:24:59,029
Yeah, well, who asked you?

442
00:24:59,063 --> 00:25:00,598
Racist and rude.

443
00:25:00,631 --> 00:25:03,134
Can't he just focus on
one blatant stereotype?

444
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:05,503
I choose to be
unnecessarily violent.

445
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,640
Stop it, Warner.

446
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:09,540
What?

447
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:10,575
You're such a jerk!

448
00:25:10,607 --> 00:25:13,176
I'm a jerk?
How?

449
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,746
Bud, put on your seatbelt,
will you?

450
00:25:14,778 --> 00:25:17,615
I can't. I need easy access
to dork kid over there.

451
00:25:17,647 --> 00:25:19,149
You knew he was gonna
pick on the whole time.

452
00:25:19,182 --> 00:25:20,751
Why'd you even come?

453
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:21,853
Entomology Club.

454
00:25:21,885 --> 00:25:23,654
The California National Forest
is crawling with, like,

455
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,758
10,000 species in
the formicidae family.

456
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,727
I'm just saying I'm a geek
who gets off on bugs, yuk-yuk.

457
00:25:31,061 --> 00:25:32,229
Leave him alone!

458
00:25:32,262 --> 00:25:33,330
Why you sticking up
for him?

459
00:25:33,364 --> 00:25:35,767
What, you got the hots
for this tool?

460
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:37,568
No!

461
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:39,738
She's has her eyes
on somebody else.

462
00:25:41,238 --> 00:25:43,141
Well, call me flattered.

463
00:25:43,173 --> 00:25:44,308
Shut up, Warner!

464
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:45,843
Hey, easy.
Not in the car.

465
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:46,978
I'm driving.

466
00:26:03,827 --> 00:26:05,696
They better not
jump out and scare us.

467
00:26:07,163 --> 00:26:08,666
I've got a weak heart.

468
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,103
<i>Paxton!</i>

469
00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:21,846
This is Paxton's phone.

470
00:26:21,878 --> 00:26:25,082
There's something
not right here.

471
00:26:29,753 --> 00:26:30,888
Who's the idiot...

472
00:26:34,224 --> 00:26:36,059
<i>Is that...</i>

473
00:26:36,093 --> 00:26:38,096
Is that...

474
00:26:38,128 --> 00:26:39,096
Yeah, that's...

475
00:26:49,105 --> 00:26:51,076
Go, go, go, go, go!

476
00:26:53,443 --> 00:26:55,046
Go, come on.
Get up!

477
00:27:06,457 --> 00:27:08,159
I can't move it, Chief.

478
00:27:08,192 --> 00:27:09,760
That's the only way
out of here

479
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,396
because this tunnel's
collapsed.

480
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:12,697
Help!

481
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,399
Anyone, we're
trapped down here!

482
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:19,303
Hey, conserve...
Conserve your oxygen.

483
00:27:19,336 --> 00:27:20,938
There's no one out there.

484
00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:22,306
The only people
who worked here

485
00:27:22,338 --> 00:27:24,808
are buried under
50 tons of concrete.

486
00:27:24,842 --> 00:27:26,009
Hail Mary,
full of grace.

487
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:26,710
The Lord is with thee.

488
00:27:26,743 --> 00:27:28,311
Blessed art thou
amongst women.

489
00:27:28,345 --> 00:27:29,647
Blessed is...

490
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:30,948
That's a great prayer.

491
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,352
That's a great way
to conserve oxygen.

492
00:27:35,452 --> 00:27:37,055
What the...

493
00:27:37,087 --> 00:27:42,292
You guys really screwed
the pooch, didn't you?

494
00:27:45,796 --> 00:27:47,164
That's weird.

495
00:28:08,018 --> 00:28:10,188
Is your sleeping bag
up there?

496
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:12,155
What about it?

497
00:28:12,189 --> 00:28:14,392
I don't know. The material
looks a little thin.

498
00:28:14,424 --> 00:28:15,960
It could get cold inside.

499
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:18,895
You think so?

500
00:28:19,997 --> 00:28:23,935
I, might know a way
to make it a little warmer.

501
00:28:30,273 --> 00:28:31,441
Guess that's settled.

502
00:28:31,474 --> 00:28:34,144
Looks like we're
hooking up this weekend.

503
00:28:34,178 --> 00:28:36,247
So...

504
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:38,014
It's possible,

505
00:28:38,048 --> 00:28:39,416
but I think there's
a better chance

506
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,086
of you getting
your face smashed in.

507
00:28:43,386 --> 00:28:45,322
But can't we do both?

508
00:28:49,292 --> 00:28:50,360
Teddy, let's go!

509
00:28:52,395 --> 00:28:54,798
Come on, dude. I want to stop
and get something to eat.

510
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,453
All these small earthquakes,
that was you.

511
00:29:16,487 --> 00:29:17,872
You fractured a fault.

512
00:29:17,873 --> 00:29:19,257
You know what?

513
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:21,424
We have followed regulation
to the letter.

514
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:22,994
Who the hell
are you guys anyway?

515
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,028
USGS.

516
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,428
Uggs?

517
00:29:25,461 --> 00:29:27,330
Them boots
Tom Brady wears?

518
00:29:27,364 --> 00:29:29,534
United States
Geological Survey.

519
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:32,870
Look, there's not been
one recorded seismic incident

520
00:29:32,903 --> 00:29:34,572
convincingly
linked to fracking.

521
00:29:34,605 --> 00:29:35,906
The only thing
that's going on here

522
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,909
is an outflow valve
malfunction...

523
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:42,480
Most likely.

524
00:29:42,512 --> 00:29:44,182
All this is from today.

525
00:29:46,517 --> 00:29:48,820
Starting here... here.

526
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:54,558
And following these lines
radiating around

527
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:57,295
from this point here
and here, flowing out.

528
00:29:57,327 --> 00:29:58,562
It's epicenter dispersal.

529
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,431
In the worst
possible way.

530
00:30:00,463 --> 00:30:02,866
You see, the entire
Los Angeles basin

531
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,969
is a network
of deep faults...

532
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:06,537
The San Andreas system.

533
00:30:06,569 --> 00:30:07,571
Ever heard of it?

534
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:08,972
This data suggests
the fluids

535
00:30:09,006 --> 00:30:10,341
being forced at
high pressure

536
00:30:10,374 --> 00:30:13,376
underneath this station
produced these microfissures

537
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:16,247
which reach all the way down
to the primary fault lines.

538
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:17,882
Causing this ripple effect.

539
00:30:17,914 --> 00:30:20,017
And now all these new
cracks are popping up

540
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:22,019
all along the deeper
fault lines

541
00:30:22,051 --> 00:30:24,554
which makes the entire
L.A. basin unstable.

542
00:30:24,587 --> 00:30:26,190
-What?
-What do you mean, unstable?

543
00:30:26,222 --> 00:30:28,459
You're predicting
a massive earthquake?

544
00:30:28,491 --> 00:30:30,228
At first,
the city will suffer

545
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:34,264
hundreds of highly localized
mini earthquakes.

546
00:30:34,298 --> 00:30:36,467
The scope of impact
can range from the size

547
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,970
of a small house
to an entire city block.

548
00:30:39,002 --> 00:30:40,937
Unless you were standing
right on top of a fissure,

549
00:30:40,971 --> 00:30:42,205
you probably
wouldn't even know it.

550
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:44,408
And when enough of these
microfissures branch out

551
00:30:44,441 --> 00:30:48,078
and cut back to their original
primary fault lines...

552
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,413
What?

553
00:30:50,446 --> 00:30:52,215
The basin will collapse.

554
00:30:52,249 --> 00:30:53,517
That, that is ridiculous!

555
00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:56,586
Can I borrow this?

556
00:30:56,619 --> 00:30:57,621
Marcus?

557
00:30:57,654 --> 00:30:59,456
This is going to be great.

558
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,858
Hey, what are you...

559
00:31:01,925 --> 00:31:03,293
Hey, what's wrong with you?

560
00:31:03,326 --> 00:31:06,663
You see, when these
microfissures come together,

561
00:31:06,696 --> 00:31:12,936
the upper strata
gets weaker and weaker until...

562
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,006
The L.A. basin caves in.

563
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:17,340
It's a virtual 10.0.

564
00:31:17,374 --> 00:31:18,608
The big one!

565
00:31:18,642 --> 00:31:20,077
<i>Dios mio!</i>

566
00:31:31,087 --> 00:31:33,523
Well, I'm going to jump
at the opportunity

567
00:31:33,557 --> 00:31:36,259
to use indoor plumbing
for the last time this weekend.

568
00:31:36,292 --> 00:31:37,394
Excuse me.

569
00:31:43,032 --> 00:31:45,468
I like your shirt, Derrick.

570
00:31:45,501 --> 00:31:48,204
Looks soft.
Is it cotton?

571
00:31:48,238 --> 00:31:51,409
Probably
a cotton/polyester blend.

572
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:53,576
Ahem.

573
00:31:53,609 --> 00:31:55,712
Hey, check this out.
This is interesting.

574
00:31:55,746 --> 00:31:57,448
Redwood ants
have chemo receptors

575
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,016
for carbon dioxide gradients

576
00:31:59,048 --> 00:32:01,719
and magnetic receptors
for electromagnetic fields.

577
00:32:03,287 --> 00:32:06,156
Okay, researchers found
that before an earthquake,

578
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,259
ants stay awake
all throughout the night,

579
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:11,528
outside their mound,
vulnerable to predators,

580
00:32:11,561 --> 00:32:13,029
and they'll stay that way,

581
00:32:13,063 --> 00:32:16,167
doing nothing until a day
after the quake.

582
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,302
I think that's what
these guys are doing.

583
00:32:18,335 --> 00:32:19,737
You're saying
ants can sense

584
00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:21,439
when an earthquake
is about to strike?

585
00:32:21,471 --> 00:32:25,509
Well, the University
Duisberg-Essen in Germany is.

586
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:26,576
I think they're right.

587
00:32:26,609 --> 00:32:28,144
It's a big one.

588
00:32:28,178 --> 00:32:30,147
Stop that!
You're going to...

589
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,315
Put it down,
put it down.

590
00:32:31,347 --> 00:32:32,383
Stop that!

591
00:32:34,617 --> 00:32:36,653
I've got to
take a leak, too.

592
00:32:36,686 --> 00:32:39,122
Teddy, take care of that,
all right?

593
00:32:39,155 --> 00:32:40,191
Yeah.

594
00:32:50,666 --> 00:32:51,769
What are you doing in here?

595
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:54,004
What do you think?

596
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,274
I don't know.

597
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,352
Okay. Just slow down.

598
00:33:09,385 --> 00:33:10,687
Maybe not in here.

599
00:33:10,721 --> 00:33:12,323
What's your problem?

600
00:33:12,355 --> 00:33:13,423
We're in a bathroom.

601
00:33:13,457 --> 00:33:15,760
Aw, come on. You know you
want it just as bad as I do.

602
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:18,395
No, Derrick.
Let's go back out there.

603
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:20,230
What, if you want
some privacy,

604
00:33:20,263 --> 00:33:22,065
-we can just go in a stall.
-No, I don't want privacy.

605
00:33:22,098 --> 00:33:23,333
I don't want privacy, Derrick.

606
00:33:23,366 --> 00:33:24,367
Stop!

607
00:33:25,701 --> 00:33:26,804
Let me out.
Let me out!

608
00:33:26,836 --> 00:33:29,773
Stop being such a prude.

609
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:31,075
Okay.

610
00:33:35,112 --> 00:33:36,581
I said stop, Derrick!

611
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,132
I guess the ants were right.

612
00:33:57,867 --> 00:33:59,669
Look, unless
you've got a subpoena,

613
00:33:59,702 --> 00:34:01,704
I can't show you
the operating logs.

614
00:34:01,738 --> 00:34:02,740
Look, I'm just the engineer.

615
00:34:02,772 --> 00:34:04,240
I don't have the authority.

616
00:34:04,273 --> 00:34:06,476
This is the owner's
direct number.

617
00:34:06,509 --> 00:34:08,579
I'm sure he'll be happy
to cooperate.

618
00:34:08,612 --> 00:34:10,681
Yes,
that'll happen.

619
00:34:10,713 --> 00:34:13,683
Here is my number.

620
00:34:13,717 --> 00:34:17,221
Call me
if you need anything.

621
00:34:17,253 --> 00:34:18,855
I'm just really sorry
about your people.

622
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:20,624
Thanks.

623
00:34:20,657 --> 00:34:23,094
If there's anything you think
we should do on our side...

624
00:34:23,126 --> 00:34:24,394
Well, if I were you,
I'd hire a lawyer

625
00:34:24,427 --> 00:34:26,130
and prepare
for 20 years in prison.

626
00:34:26,163 --> 00:34:28,331
Of course, you might luck out
and die in the earthquake.

627
00:34:28,364 --> 00:34:31,568
Sorry. Hope the rest
of your day goes better.

628
00:34:35,271 --> 00:34:37,540
You think they're right
that we caused this?

629
00:34:37,574 --> 00:34:38,543
I don't know.

630
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:41,479
Maybe.

631
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:43,747
Come on,
damn it.

632
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,748
Why don't you answer?

633
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,317
Nicole?

634
00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:48,318
Yeah.
She and her friends...

635
00:34:48,351 --> 00:34:50,887
They're headed
straight for the...

636
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,389
Hey. Yeah,
listen, it's me.

637
00:34:53,422 --> 00:34:56,793
Listen,
are you sitting down?

638
00:34:56,827 --> 00:34:59,597
Paxton and Hicks are dead.

639
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,233
The access tunnel collapsed,
and guess who I just had

640
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,902
a very long and frightening
conversation with?

641
00:35:04,934 --> 00:35:07,137
Yeah, the f'ing USGS.

642
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,505
Jack, listen to me.

643
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:12,376
They're just looking
for someone to blame, okay.

644
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:14,512
Calm down, calm down.
Listen to me.

645
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:17,280
Once we go live,
we'll scale back for a few days.

646
00:35:17,313 --> 00:35:18,882
Everything will be cool.
All right?

647
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:20,251
But these aren't regulators.

648
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,652
These are scientists
who are sure

649
00:35:21,684 --> 00:35:24,221
that we are responsible
for every single sinkhole

650
00:35:24,253 --> 00:35:25,589
that is happening
across the city.

651
00:35:26,822 --> 00:35:27,790
Well,
Hold on, hold on.

652
00:35:27,824 --> 00:35:28,858
Slow your horses.

653
00:35:28,891 --> 00:35:30,627
What's going on?

654
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:31,695
Earthquakes?

655
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:36,800
You follow protocol, right?

656
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:38,335
I mean, my schematics to a T,

657
00:35:38,367 --> 00:35:41,505
because if I find out
that you drilled too deep...

658
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:45,342
We are not opening
Station Five tonight.

659
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:48,344
Why? Because we have
two employees

660
00:35:48,378 --> 00:35:50,314
who died a heluva gruesome...

661
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,317
This,
this is a PR nightmare.

662
00:35:55,552 --> 00:35:57,820
And if you want to
escalate the problem...

663
00:35:57,853 --> 00:36:01,224
Look, Ritter,
my daughter is up there.

664
00:36:01,257 --> 00:36:02,525
Now just promise me

665
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:04,528
that you will shut down
every single station

666
00:36:04,561 --> 00:36:06,664
until we can find out
exactly what went wrong.

667
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:07,898
You have my word.

668
00:36:07,931 --> 00:36:09,532
Just take care
of your family,

669
00:36:09,565 --> 00:36:13,403
and I'll take care
of things up here, okay?

670
00:36:13,436 --> 00:36:14,505
Later.

671
00:36:14,538 --> 00:36:15,972
God damn it!

672
00:36:16,005 --> 00:36:18,442
Hey Hector,
call your family.

673
00:36:18,474 --> 00:36:20,677
Send them south.
Then head to five,

674
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,278
make sure Ritter doesn't do
anything stupid.

675
00:36:22,311 --> 00:36:23,547
-I don't trust that guy.
-Who does?

676
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:24,715
What about the bodies?

677
00:36:24,748 --> 00:36:26,817
I'll call the police
on the way.

678
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:30,520
I'm going to get my family, and I'll
meet you up there as soon as possible.

679
00:36:50,574 --> 00:36:52,576
<i>First of all,
it's the zone...</i>

680
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,710
<i>The Alquist Priolo zone</i>

681
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,046
<i>which as Dr. Parrish mentioned,</i>

682
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:58,015
<i>has the greatest potential
for surface fault rupture</i>

683
00:36:58,047 --> 00:37:01,317
<i>which is much more likely
to cause damage</i>

684
00:37:01,351 --> 00:37:03,320
<i>and, and death and injury.</i>

685
00:37:03,353 --> 00:37:04,688
<i>It's limited to an area</i>

686
00:37:04,721 --> 00:37:06,456
<i>around the base
of the Hollywood Hills.</i>

687
00:37:06,489 --> 00:37:08,491
<i>Much of Hollywood
is not affected by this map.</i>

688
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,862
Earthquake?

689
00:37:12,896 --> 00:37:14,932
It's an earthquake.

690
00:37:14,965 --> 00:37:15,966
My God!

691
00:37:15,998 --> 00:37:17,533
My God!

692
00:37:17,567 --> 00:37:18,501
<i>Help!</i>

693
00:37:32,014 --> 00:37:33,817
-Steph!
-Jack!

694
00:37:35,552 --> 00:37:37,054
Where's your phone?
Where's your phone?

695
00:37:37,086 --> 00:37:38,889
In the kitchen,
in the kitchen.

696
00:37:38,922 --> 00:37:40,023
God!

697
00:37:40,056 --> 00:37:41,358
What are you doing?
Come on.

698
00:37:55,005 --> 00:37:56,039
Come on! Let's go!

699
00:37:56,072 --> 00:37:57,407
-What?
-Let's go!

700
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,485
My God!

701
00:38:08,518 --> 00:38:09,887
Okay, all right.
Come on. Let's go!

702
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,989
Go? Go where?
What do you mean?

703
00:38:12,021 --> 00:38:13,790
We have to find
our daughter. Come on.

704
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:14,791
God!

705
00:38:35,378 --> 00:38:36,880
Be aware of wolves.

706
00:38:36,913 --> 00:38:38,782
-You say something?
-No.

707
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,952
Guys, maybe, maybe
we should just go back.

708
00:38:42,985 --> 00:38:44,087
What?

709
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:46,789
Why? Because of
that little tremble?

710
00:38:46,822 --> 00:38:49,525
Those aftershocks are
happening all over the place.

711
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:51,428
Everybody's Twitter
on Twitter.

712
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,829
That's funny.

713
00:38:52,862 --> 00:38:54,130
What is?

714
00:38:54,164 --> 00:38:56,967
Your Twit...
Never mind.

715
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,835
Look, I think Nicole's right.

716
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:01,038
I was reading about these
really intense sinkholes

717
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:03,873
before I ran out of juice.

718
00:39:03,907 --> 00:39:06,110
By the way, can I,
can I use your phone charger?

719
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:09,112
No, I'm using it
and we're not turning around.

720
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:10,381
You guys are worried
about sinkholes.

721
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:11,615
Seriously?

722
00:39:11,648 --> 00:39:13,717
Yeah, come on.
We're already here anyway.

723
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,353
Woo-hoo!

724
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,982
What's the matter, boy?

725
00:40:07,003 --> 00:40:08,672
Relax, relax.

726
00:40:20,115 --> 00:40:21,751
I felt that, too.

727
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:58,722
That can't be right.

728
00:41:00,155 --> 00:41:01,858
It's right here.

729
00:41:17,139 --> 00:41:18,674
Hey, hey, hey, baby.

730
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:19,910
I just want to tell you
that I love you

731
00:41:19,943 --> 00:41:21,745
and you mean
absolutely the world to me

732
00:41:21,777 --> 00:41:26,115
and I just wanted you to know
that time in Cabo

733
00:41:26,148 --> 00:41:28,085
when you were
passed out, yes,

734
00:41:28,117 --> 00:41:30,686
I-I did hook up with the concierge,
but it didn't mean anything.

735
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:33,523
If you can just find it
in your heart to just for...

736
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,630
Hey, baby, if you could just
disregard that message.

737
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,299
I'll see you
when you get home.

738
00:41:42,331 --> 00:41:43,800
Love you, Dennis.

739
00:41:52,641 --> 00:41:55,011
That was close.

740
00:42:00,817 --> 00:42:02,184
He's still
not answering.

741
00:42:02,217 --> 00:42:03,553
Well, then
try someone else.

742
00:42:03,586 --> 00:42:05,688
There must be 100 bureaucrats
at the USGS

743
00:42:05,722 --> 00:42:06,957
who'll take your call.

744
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:11,894
I bet he's just buried
in paperwork.

745
00:42:11,927 --> 00:42:13,696
If the evacuation
doesn't begin soon,

746
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:15,798
the consequences
will be catastrophic.

747
00:42:15,831 --> 00:42:18,268
There must be someone
in authority we can call.

748
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,570
I don't know who.
It's, it's my first day,

749
00:42:20,603 --> 00:42:22,906
and they sure as heck
won't listen to me.

750
00:42:34,317 --> 00:42:35,652
<i>What?</i>

751
00:42:35,684 --> 00:42:37,119
What do you mean,
it's your fault?

752
00:42:37,152 --> 00:42:39,956
Look, it might be.

753
00:42:39,989 --> 00:42:41,791
Look, the tremors might...

754
00:42:41,824 --> 00:42:45,161
might have been caused by
one of our fracking stations.

755
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:48,265
Jack, this is
so like you.

756
00:42:48,297 --> 00:42:49,765
Yeah, that's right.

757
00:42:49,798 --> 00:42:51,233
So like me because
I've got a long history

758
00:42:51,266 --> 00:42:52,935
of starting earthquakes.

759
00:42:52,969 --> 00:42:54,704
Let's see, now, Northridge,
yeah, that was me.

760
00:42:54,737 --> 00:42:56,138
Philippines, yeah,
that was me again.

761
00:42:56,172 --> 00:42:57,673
You know,
you put our family last

762
00:42:57,706 --> 00:42:59,141
and that's pretty much
the same.

763
00:42:59,175 --> 00:43:00,611
-Yeah.
-That is...

764
00:43:00,643 --> 00:43:02,912
You know, that is
unbelievable because...

765
00:43:02,945 --> 00:43:04,114
Ok, hang on...

766
00:43:04,146 --> 00:43:05,849
<i>-What?
-I think I found her.</i>

767
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:08,652
What is it?
You found Nicole?

768
00:43:08,684 --> 00:43:09,820
Send her a text

769
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:11,688
and just keep an eye
on where she is.

770
00:43:11,721 --> 00:43:12,956
Come on, move it, people.

771
00:43:12,989 --> 00:43:15,057
Come on, Nicole.
Just show us where you are.

772
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,926
Just let us know
you're okay.

773
00:43:27,269 --> 00:43:28,972
Guys...

774
00:43:29,005 --> 00:43:30,340
guys, we need
to go back, like, now.

775
00:43:30,373 --> 00:43:31,907
What? Why?

776
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,143
I'm serious.
We're in real danger here.

777
00:43:33,175 --> 00:43:34,378
All right, here we go.

778
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:35,378
Why, what did you read?

779
00:43:35,411 --> 00:43:36,980
Seriously, Nicole.

780
00:43:37,012 --> 00:43:37,713
I'm tired of it.

781
00:43:37,746 --> 00:43:40,250
Stop being
such a bitch, okay?

782
00:43:40,282 --> 00:43:41,317
This isn't your truck

783
00:43:41,351 --> 00:43:42,385
and you're not...

784
00:43:42,418 --> 00:43:44,020
Jesus!

785
00:43:50,793 --> 00:43:51,795
<i>She stopped moving.</i>

786
00:43:51,827 --> 00:43:53,030
God,
she stopped moving!

787
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:54,131
That's good.

788
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:56,233
It means she set up camp.

789
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:57,934
Okay, so it's a good thing.

790
00:43:57,967 --> 00:43:59,202
All right.

791
00:43:59,235 --> 00:44:00,303
<i>Okay.</i>

792
00:44:00,335 --> 00:44:01,804
God!

793
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:03,273
-Well...
-Where are you going?

794
00:44:03,306 --> 00:44:04,942
-What are you doing?
-Taking a shortcut.

795
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:13,817
<i>Taking a shortcut
to the Ronald Reagan.</i>

796
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:15,251
There'll be a little bit
more traffic on the five,

797
00:44:15,284 --> 00:44:18,020
but after that it should be
smooth sailing until the forest.

798
00:44:18,054 --> 00:44:19,155
Let's hope so.

799
00:44:19,188 --> 00:44:20,456
Don't worry.

800
00:44:20,489 --> 00:44:22,792
The worst is behind us.

801
00:44:29,231 --> 00:44:31,233
Dr. Booker!

802
00:44:31,266 --> 00:44:34,036
Dr. Booker!

803
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:35,739
Michael!

804
00:44:35,771 --> 00:44:37,240
Help me get this
off of him!

805
00:44:42,911 --> 00:44:44,213
There's no point in
digging him out.

806
00:44:44,246 --> 00:44:45,315
We need to get going.

807
00:44:45,347 --> 00:44:46,449
We can't just leave him.

808
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:48,018
<i>Yes, we can.</i>

809
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:50,152
If you want to fish him out
and take him with us,

810
00:44:50,186 --> 00:44:51,321
I call shotgun.

811
00:44:51,353 --> 00:44:52,989
How could you be so callous?

812
00:44:53,021 --> 00:44:55,759
Years of practice.

813
00:44:55,791 --> 00:44:57,293
Fudge nuggets!

814
00:44:57,327 --> 00:44:58,995
What? How bad is it?

815
00:44:59,027 --> 00:45:02,498
Horrible for everyone
in Los Angeles except you.

816
00:45:02,532 --> 00:45:03,800
Why not me?

817
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:05,402
You just got a promotion.

818
00:45:05,434 --> 00:45:06,769
Let's go!

819
00:45:12,007 --> 00:45:13,743
Do you think she's okay?

820
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:15,177
Yeah, don't worry.

821
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:18,347
You know, the cell service
is one of the first things

822
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,149
to always go down.

823
00:45:20,182 --> 00:45:21,418
Trust me.

824
00:45:21,451 --> 00:45:24,054
Nicole's much safer
out of the city anyway.

825
00:45:24,086 --> 00:45:25,822
I mean, how do you know?
Are you just saying that?

826
00:45:25,855 --> 00:45:27,123
-Are you sure...
-No, look.

827
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:28,992
-To make me feel better?
-Just, just imagine

828
00:45:29,025 --> 00:45:32,796
That the earth's crust over L.A.
is like a broken windshield.

829
00:45:32,829 --> 00:45:33,930
I don't understand.

830
00:45:33,963 --> 00:45:35,332
Like the crust
is like a windshield.

831
00:45:35,364 --> 00:45:36,799
I don't understand
what you're saying.

832
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:39,302
I really need
a hammer to explain.

833
00:45:39,335 --> 00:45:40,269
Holy...

834
00:45:43,806 --> 00:45:45,274
-I see it.
-Faster!

835
00:45:45,307 --> 00:45:46,275
Hold on!

836
00:45:49,344 --> 00:45:50,747
-Jesus.
-Faster!

837
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:08,431
Faster!

838
00:46:22,945 --> 00:46:25,414
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

839
00:46:25,447 --> 00:46:28,050
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
Pray for us sinners now...

840
00:46:28,083 --> 00:46:29,585
Are you praying?
When did you start praying?

841
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:30,988
I just picked it up!

842
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:37,594
Jack, Jack, I-I...
I lost the phone.

843
00:46:37,626 --> 00:46:39,195
What? What?

844
00:46:39,228 --> 00:46:41,263
-We need that to find Nicole.
-I know. I'm sorry.

845
00:46:41,297 --> 00:46:43,465
It just slipped out
of my hands into nothing.

846
00:46:43,498 --> 00:46:44,600
Look,just, here,
just take the wheel.

847
00:46:44,634 --> 00:46:46,101
-God!
-Take the wheel.

848
00:46:46,135 --> 00:46:48,205
And don't stop driving.
Come on, take it!

849
00:46:48,237 --> 00:46:49,205
-Okay.
-Take it!

850
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:51,141
I got it!

851
00:46:51,173 --> 00:46:52,409
I got it!

852
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:54,043
-You got it?
-Yeah!

853
00:47:02,652 --> 00:47:04,021
Be careful!

854
00:47:05,521 --> 00:47:07,224
Steph, steady!

855
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:08,892
I'm trying!

856
00:47:43,259 --> 00:47:44,894
Crap!

857
00:47:46,628 --> 00:47:48,431
I got it!

858
00:47:53,936 --> 00:47:55,438
I got it,
I got it, Steph.

859
00:47:57,273 --> 00:47:58,909
God!

860
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:06,516
Steph, what are you doing?

861
00:48:06,548 --> 00:48:09,385
Hold on!

862
00:48:09,418 --> 00:48:10,619
My God!

863
00:48:11,621 --> 00:48:13,056
Steph, geez!

864
00:48:24,733 --> 00:48:26,001
<i>I think
this is a bigger problem</i>

865
00:48:26,034 --> 00:48:27,471
<i>than a broken windshield.</i>

866
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:36,246
<i>Guys, help!</i>

867
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,990
<i>Guys! Come help!</i>

868
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:51,428
Hey, Teddy,
are you okay?

869
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:52,395
Where are we?

870
00:48:54,597 --> 00:48:56,466
<i>I can not hold on much longer.
Please, please. Help me!</i>

871
00:48:57,532 --> 00:48:59,001
Cindy?

872
00:48:59,034 --> 00:49:00,603
My God!

873
00:49:00,635 --> 00:49:03,139
<i>Derrick, Cindy!</i>

874
00:49:03,172 --> 00:49:06,376
You guys, help!

875
00:49:06,409 --> 00:49:08,144
God!

876
00:49:08,177 --> 00:49:11,148
Jesus, fuck, that's...
That's high!

877
00:49:13,148 --> 00:49:15,018
-We have to get out of here.
-Guys, the windshield.

878
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:16,319
-My God!
-Where's Warner?

879
00:49:18,153 --> 00:49:20,023
Guys, the windshield.

880
00:49:27,797 --> 00:49:30,766
Help!

881
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,602
No, no, no.

882
00:49:32,635 --> 00:49:34,604
Help!

883
00:49:34,637 --> 00:49:35,772
God damn it!

884
00:49:35,804 --> 00:49:37,473
We're coming, Warner.

885
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:39,075
<i>I don't want to die!</i>

886
00:49:39,108 --> 00:49:40,710
What do we do? What do we do?
Should we put it in reverse?

887
00:49:40,742 --> 00:49:43,545
I don't know,
but we've got to do something!

888
00:49:43,579 --> 00:49:45,449
Keep your weight on the car.

889
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:55,759
Hey, hey, hey.
That's not such a wise idea.

890
00:49:55,791 --> 00:49:57,059
Nobody asked you!

891
00:49:57,092 --> 00:49:58,527
Guys, come on, come on.

892
00:50:01,764 --> 00:50:03,633
We're coming!

893
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:04,634
Damn it!

894
00:50:04,666 --> 00:50:06,235
Cindy...

895
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,471
We're gonna keep holding.

896
00:50:08,503 --> 00:50:09,772
You're gonna make your way
over to Warner

897
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:10,807
and give him this strap.

898
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,409
You'll pull him up?

899
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:13,675
Once he's got the strap...

900
00:50:13,708 --> 00:50:15,177
<i>We let go of the car?</i>

901
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:17,646
We grab the strap and we all
pull him in together.

902
00:50:23,552 --> 00:50:27,056
What the hell
is taking you so long?

903
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:28,291
We're gonna do this, Cindy.

904
00:50:28,324 --> 00:50:30,293
Okay.

905
00:50:30,326 --> 00:50:33,262
<i>Mother of... wait!</i>

906
00:50:33,295 --> 00:50:34,297
We're coming.

907
00:50:55,885 --> 00:50:57,320
<i>Warner?</i>

908
00:50:57,353 --> 00:50:58,387
Cindy?

909
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:00,589
I'm gonna hand you
the end, okay?

910
00:51:00,623 --> 00:51:01,825
<i>Okay, please hurry.
Hurry.</i>

911
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:02,859
Okay, ready?

912
00:51:02,891 --> 00:51:04,159
Yeah, I'm ready.

913
00:51:04,193 --> 00:51:05,395
-Catch!
-Come on.

914
00:51:05,427 --> 00:51:07,163
You've got to get it closer,
please.

915
00:51:07,195 --> 00:51:08,531
-You got it?
-No!

916
00:51:12,735 --> 00:51:15,338
What is going on
up there, guys?

917
00:51:15,371 --> 00:51:16,405
Cindy, come on!

918
00:51:16,438 --> 00:51:18,273
I'm trying, I'm trying!

919
00:51:18,306 --> 00:51:20,076
Cindy, come on.
We can't hold it!

920
00:51:27,916 --> 00:51:29,351
Teddy, you moth...

921
00:51:29,385 --> 00:51:31,153
Catch!

922
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,295
On the count of three.

923
00:51:40,329 --> 00:51:41,631
<i>-All right, let's go!
-Ready?</i>

924
00:51:41,664 --> 00:51:42,799
Yeah, I'm ready.

925
00:51:42,831 --> 00:51:44,201
One...

926
00:51:46,735 --> 00:51:47,769
Two...

927
00:51:47,802 --> 00:51:49,438
Goddamn it!

928
00:51:49,472 --> 00:51:51,474
Three.

929
00:51:51,507 --> 00:51:52,509
Fuck!

930
00:51:57,413 --> 00:52:00,449
No! No!

931
00:52:14,864 --> 00:52:16,398
Damn it!

932
00:52:16,431 --> 00:52:18,300
Nobody's picking up
at L.A. Emergency either.

933
00:52:20,969 --> 00:52:23,672
Great!

934
00:52:23,706 --> 00:52:25,175
What are you doing?
Don't stop!

935
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,343
We're in a code red here.
We got carte blanche!

936
00:52:27,376 --> 00:52:28,678
I already have two points
on my license!

937
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:29,945
Who cares?

938
00:52:29,978 --> 00:52:31,813
You're the new commanding
head of the USGS.

939
00:52:31,847 --> 00:52:33,383
Embrace the power.

940
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:35,218
Just let me
do the talking.

941
00:52:49,664 --> 00:52:51,467
License, registration,
proof of insurance,

942
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,300
please, ma'am.

943
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:54,603
Officer, you see
those fires downtown?

944
00:52:54,637 --> 00:52:56,206
That's just the beginning.

945
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,943
Sir, I'm not
addressing you.

946
00:53:00,976 --> 00:53:03,445
Marcus, please.

947
00:53:03,478 --> 00:53:05,547
License and registration,
please, ma'am.

948
00:53:05,581 --> 00:53:08,218
Yes. Just a moment.
It's...

949
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:09,452
Show him your badge.

950
00:53:09,485 --> 00:53:10,720
Quiet!

951
00:53:10,753 --> 00:53:13,423
Sorry. It... I'm sure
it's in here somewhere.

952
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:16,326
This is ridiculous.
Officer, we're in a hurry.

953
00:53:16,358 --> 00:53:18,927
Sir, I'm not addressing you.
I'll be with you soon.

954
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,396
Ma'am, license
and registration, please.

955
00:53:21,429 --> 00:53:23,465
Just, it's in here
somewhere.

956
00:53:23,498 --> 00:53:24,466
I can't...

957
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,436
I'm sure you have
a quota and all,

958
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:29,505
but I highly recommend
you let this little fish go.

959
00:53:29,538 --> 00:53:32,608
Sir, this is
your last warning.

960
00:53:35,043 --> 00:53:36,545
Isn't that convenient?

961
00:53:36,579 --> 00:53:40,483
Michael T. Booker,
United States Geological Survey.

962
00:53:40,516 --> 00:53:42,918
You've just pulled over
two genius scientists

963
00:53:42,952 --> 00:53:45,021
whose data can prove
we're about to have

964
00:53:45,054 --> 00:53:46,521
the biggest earthquake ever,

965
00:53:46,554 --> 00:53:49,524
and this lovely doctor here
is the sole individual

966
00:53:49,557 --> 00:53:53,496
who can convince the governor
to evacuate the city.

967
00:53:53,528 --> 00:53:54,731
Hi.

968
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:56,365
So unless
you want to be known

969
00:53:56,398 --> 00:54:00,302
as the cop who let 3.8 million
Angelinos die a tragic death,

970
00:54:00,335 --> 00:54:03,538
I suggest you get
on your bike and escort us

971
00:54:03,572 --> 00:54:07,777
to the L.A. Emergency
Management Center, pronto!

972
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:11,914
Now, Ponch!

973
00:54:11,947 --> 00:54:13,816
You just stay
off your cell phone.

974
00:54:13,849 --> 00:54:15,785
Are you serious?

975
00:54:15,818 --> 00:54:17,653
Will do, officer.

976
00:54:17,686 --> 00:54:18,688
Follow me!

977
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:52,389
<i>And we're coming up
on the Capital Records Tower...</i>

978
00:54:53,989 --> 00:54:56,326
<i>opened in 1956.</i>

979
00:55:00,528 --> 00:55:02,398
<i>Folks, calm down.
It's just a tremble.</i>

980
00:55:14,143 --> 00:55:16,813
So she isn't
safer out there.

981
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:19,481
Only if Ritter returns on 5, and
he assured me that he wouldn't.

982
00:55:20,615 --> 00:55:22,585
He assured you.
The man is a known scumbag.

983
00:55:22,617 --> 00:55:24,086
You should have
left that job...

984
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:25,721
Look, are we going to have
this tired argument again?

985
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:27,523
I feel like you chose this jerk
over your own family.

986
00:55:27,556 --> 00:55:28,891
No, you were the one
who left me, okay?

987
00:55:28,923 --> 00:55:31,494
I recall giving you
several opportunities...

988
00:55:31,527 --> 00:55:32,795
Why, why are you turning?

989
00:55:32,827 --> 00:55:34,429
'Cause I need gas.

990
00:55:34,463 --> 00:55:35,665
There's, there's plenty of gas
in the tank.

991
00:55:35,697 --> 00:55:37,733
What we need to do
is get to our daughter.

992
00:55:37,766 --> 00:55:39,501
I don't know how long we'll be driving
around in this wilderness for.

993
00:55:39,534 --> 00:55:40,936
Nicole must be
terrified out there.

994
00:55:40,969 --> 00:55:42,404
But there's no station
out there.

995
00:55:47,076 --> 00:55:50,512
I think you're right.
Best not to stop.

996
00:55:52,414 --> 00:55:53,583
<i>These localized earthquakes</i>

997
00:55:53,615 --> 00:55:55,083
<i>have yet to be confirmed</i>

998
00:55:55,117 --> 00:55:57,019
<i>by the US Geological Survey
at CalTech</i>

999
00:55:57,052 --> 00:55:58,488
<i>which couldn't be reached...</i>

1000
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,490
I should have never let him
touch my hammer.

1001
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:10,467
They sure don't look
shut down.

1002
00:56:23,545 --> 00:56:25,414
Yeah, I know.
I need a haircut.

1003
00:56:29,217 --> 00:56:31,420
Okay. Follow me.

1004
00:56:33,688 --> 00:56:34,656
A haircut?

1005
00:56:38,626 --> 00:56:40,730
You need to show
confidence and grit

1006
00:56:40,762 --> 00:56:42,465
if you want these guys
to listen to you.

1007
00:56:42,498 --> 00:56:45,467
You know what you're doing,
so now convince them.

1008
00:56:45,501 --> 00:56:46,702
<i>Then re-route the buses.</i>

1009
00:56:46,735 --> 00:56:48,037
<i>Come on, people.
Use your head.</i>

1010
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:49,539
Where the hell is Booker?

1011
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,073
We're getting tremors
all through the city

1012
00:56:51,106 --> 00:56:52,175
and I'm flying blind here.

1013
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:53,675
He's Booker, sir.

1014
00:56:57,179 --> 00:56:59,014
I just sent two uniforms
down to CTech.

1015
00:56:59,047 --> 00:57:00,582
Why the hell
hasn't he called in?

1016
00:57:00,615 --> 00:57:02,184
Are either of you
even with USGS?

1017
00:57:02,217 --> 00:57:03,219
Yes, I am.

1018
00:57:03,251 --> 00:57:04,487
Emily Schiffman.

1019
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:05,688
I used to work
under Dr. Booker

1020
00:57:05,721 --> 00:57:08,224
and this is our colleague,
Dr. Gladstone.

1021
00:57:08,257 --> 00:57:10,659
Gladstone, the crank?

1022
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:13,062
Dr. Crank, if you must
go there, Lieutenant.

1023
00:57:14,195 --> 00:57:15,898
You two know each other?

1024
00:57:15,931 --> 00:57:18,568
Every other month, I get a warning
from the good doctor here.

1025
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:21,871
Bird flu epidemic, deadly pollen
virus... what was the last one?

1026
00:57:21,903 --> 00:57:23,539
Shark hurricane?

1027
00:57:23,572 --> 00:57:25,875
You have no idea how close that
came to actually happening.

1028
00:57:25,907 --> 00:57:27,509
Now you said "worked."

1029
00:57:27,543 --> 00:57:29,945
What did Booker fire you for,
being a crackpot, too?

1030
00:57:29,978 --> 00:57:31,079
Dr. Booker is dead.

1031
00:57:31,112 --> 00:57:33,114
We just came from USGS
with this data

1032
00:57:33,148 --> 00:57:35,617
that we were planning
to show him, Lieutenant.

1033
00:57:37,186 --> 00:57:39,521
No, no, no. I want
the Red Cross at the Bowl.

1034
00:57:39,554 --> 00:57:41,890
Look, I don't give two craps
if Neil Diamond is sold out.

1035
00:57:41,923 --> 00:57:42,958
Just get it done!
What?

1036
00:57:45,059 --> 00:57:47,128
You need to evacuate
Los Angeles.

1037
00:57:47,161 --> 00:57:49,865
Evacuate
the entire city?

1038
00:57:49,898 --> 00:57:51,199
You're both nutbags.

1039
00:57:51,233 --> 00:57:53,870
Lieutenant,
everything that's happened...

1040
00:57:53,902 --> 00:57:59,574
The sinkholes are modest
seismic disturbances,

1041
00:57:59,608 --> 00:58:01,143
and there'll be more.

1042
00:58:01,175 --> 00:58:02,644
<i>Next...</i>

1043
00:58:10,885 --> 00:58:14,757
<i>Next there'll be power surges
across the city.</i>

1044
00:58:17,159 --> 00:58:18,561
I didn't save!

1045
00:58:18,594 --> 00:58:21,230
And all of this
is nothing...

1046
00:58:21,262 --> 00:58:24,733
Just little problems,
small potatoes.

1047
00:58:24,766 --> 00:58:26,301
How are they just
little problems?

1048
00:58:26,335 --> 00:58:27,970
What he's trying to say, sir,

1049
00:58:28,003 --> 00:58:30,239
is that the faults underneath
the L.A. basin are cracking.

1050
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:31,773
Hey, small words.

1051
00:58:31,806 --> 00:58:34,943
Which one was too big
for you... fault, basin, the?

1052
00:58:34,976 --> 00:58:37,112
The lithosphere,
the crust of earth beneath us.

1053
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:40,550
South of the Sierra Madres
and west of Pasadena,

1054
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:42,552
it's breaking
into little pieces,

1055
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:45,186
and everything on top of it
is gonna crumble

1056
00:58:45,219 --> 00:58:47,188
<i>and fall into the ocean.</i>

1057
00:58:47,222 --> 00:58:49,559
Sir, what do you
want to do about the SDFD?

1058
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:51,661
Do I really have to do
everything around here?

1059
00:58:54,663 --> 00:58:57,199
Put the SDFD on standby.

1060
00:58:57,231 --> 00:58:58,701
And how do you suggest
we stop it?

1061
00:58:58,733 --> 00:59:00,802
You can't control
an earthquake.

1062
00:59:00,835 --> 00:59:01,636
Not true!

1063
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:03,039
What are you
talking about, Marcus?

1064
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:04,941
Epicenter containment.

1065
00:59:06,275 --> 00:59:07,677
Where did you get that?

1066
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,345
Here's what
we're gonna do...

1067
00:59:09,378 --> 00:59:11,681
We're gonna blow up
the original epicenter

1068
00:59:11,713 --> 00:59:14,983
and create one ginormous
localized catastrophe.

1069
00:59:15,016 --> 00:59:17,052
-Say, what?
-It's Emily's dissertation.

1070
00:59:17,085 --> 00:59:18,920
It's her theory,
it's our plan.

1071
00:59:18,954 --> 00:59:20,923
-It's a good plan.
-It's a C minus plan.

1072
00:59:20,956 --> 00:59:24,594
You're suggesting that we
purposely destroy Long Beach.

1073
00:59:24,626 --> 00:59:27,329
You'll have a good
7/8s of Los Angeles left.

1074
00:59:27,362 --> 00:59:28,663
Is he serious?

1075
00:59:28,697 --> 00:59:31,901
You're right,
he is a nutbag!

1076
00:59:31,934 --> 00:59:35,138
People, it's Long Beach...
Who's gonna miss it?

1077
00:59:40,809 --> 00:59:42,244
Okay, it looks like
we cross a stream

1078
00:59:42,277 --> 00:59:46,248
and the ranger station's
one mile north.

1079
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,650
We should've
stayed on the road.

1080
00:59:47,682 --> 00:59:48,951
I have no idea...

1081
00:59:48,983 --> 00:59:50,953
Do we even know
that way's north?

1082
00:59:53,755 --> 00:59:55,190
Cindy, is there any service
on that phone?

1083
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:56,726
Nope.

1084
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,994
Maybe we should just
retrace our steps and head back.

1085
00:59:59,027 --> 01:00:00,195
Forget that.

1086
01:00:00,228 --> 01:00:01,864
The road is about
three miles back

1087
01:00:01,896 --> 01:00:03,331
and the ranger station's
one mile ahead.

1088
01:00:03,364 --> 01:00:05,033
It's getting dark.

1089
01:00:05,067 --> 01:00:07,369
That's right, and unless
you want to end up like Warner,

1090
01:00:07,402 --> 01:00:09,771
stop bitching
and start moving.

1091
01:00:09,804 --> 01:00:11,206
Derrick!

1092
01:00:13,275 --> 01:00:14,675
Let's go, people.

1093
01:00:18,746 --> 01:00:20,815
Cindy, make sure
not to get your phone wet.

1094
01:00:20,849 --> 01:00:22,718
It's two feet deep,
genius.

1095
01:00:22,751 --> 01:00:24,120
I think I can handle it.

1096
01:00:24,152 --> 01:00:25,120
Let's go, people!

1097
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:48,943
I'm stuck.

1098
01:00:48,976 --> 01:00:50,712
My God!
It won't budge.

1099
01:00:50,746 --> 01:00:51,780
Relax, it's over.

1100
01:00:51,813 --> 01:00:54,983
God!
I was kind of scared.

1101
01:00:56,851 --> 01:00:59,221
Careful, I don't
want to lose my shoe.

1102
01:01:01,123 --> 01:01:03,059
My God!
Is that another earthquake?

1103
01:01:07,963 --> 01:01:09,432
My God!
Get me out!

1104
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:11,067
Get me out!

1105
01:01:13,335 --> 01:01:14,302
Get me out!

1106
01:01:26,347 --> 01:01:27,750
I told you
to move faster.

1107
01:01:29,117 --> 01:01:31,052
At least someone
enjoyed the show.

1108
01:01:54,842 --> 01:01:55,844
Careful.

1109
01:01:55,845 --> 01:01:56,846
My God!

1110
01:01:58,347 --> 01:01:59,348
She's down there?

1111
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:01,049
Nicole!

1112
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:03,085
Nicole!

1113
01:02:03,117 --> 01:02:04,987
My God!

1114
01:02:05,019 --> 01:02:06,155
That's their car,
isn't it?

1115
01:02:06,188 --> 01:02:08,356
Please, God.
Please let Nicole be okay.

1116
01:02:08,389 --> 01:02:09,424
Here, hold this.

1117
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:11,027
What?
Be careful!

1118
01:02:12,193 --> 01:02:14,262
Please, God, let her be okay,
let her be okay.

1119
01:02:18,967 --> 01:02:22,137
If the dog has a tag on,
maybe we can look call the...

1120
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:23,271
Shut up about the dog!

1121
01:02:24,572 --> 01:02:26,208
Teddy, what's going on
with the phone?

1122
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,342
Can we fix it?

1123
01:02:33,382 --> 01:02:34,550
Eyes, focus, man.

1124
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:36,519
Yeah, yeah.
It's trashed.

1125
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:37,737
Sorry.

1126
01:02:37,738 --> 01:02:38,921
Great.

1127
01:02:38,954 --> 01:02:40,222
Guys, I don't know.
It's so dark.

1128
01:02:40,255 --> 01:02:41,490
I say we head
for those caves back there.

1129
01:02:41,523 --> 01:02:42,925
Yes.

1130
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:44,160
Wait, wait.
What if there's another quake.

1131
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:45,795
I don't want to get stuck
in a cave-in.

1132
01:02:45,827 --> 01:02:47,329
Those caves
look pretty safe.

1133
01:02:47,362 --> 01:02:49,865
I mean, that mountain's been
there for hundreds of years.

1134
01:02:49,898 --> 01:02:52,968
I, I say we stick
to the ranger station plan.

1135
01:02:53,001 --> 01:02:54,303
-It'll, it'll...
-No! Okay, I'm freezing,

1136
01:02:54,335 --> 01:02:57,005
And I'd rather not get
eaten alive by a wild animal.

1137
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:01,210
If we hoof it now, we can make
it back in an hour easy.

1138
01:03:01,242 --> 01:03:03,978
No. No.

1139
01:03:04,012 --> 01:03:06,148
I'm not going into a dark
cave with you, Derrick.

1140
01:03:06,181 --> 01:03:07,550
What, are you serious?
What is your problem?

1141
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:08,884
Why are you attacking me?

1142
01:03:08,916 --> 01:03:10,052
You know exactly
what my problem is.

1143
01:03:10,085 --> 01:03:11,387
Are you serious?
You're the one

1144
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:12,421
leading me on
for, like, months.

1145
01:03:12,454 --> 01:03:13,522
-Leading you on?
-Yeah.

1146
01:03:13,554 --> 01:03:14,522
-To that, really?
-Guys!

1147
01:03:14,556 --> 01:03:15,958
Guys!

1148
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:19,795
Look, I think we just found
our salvation.

1149
01:03:26,534 --> 01:03:28,369
-That's disgusting.
-You're a sicko, dude.

1150
01:03:28,402 --> 01:03:30,004
Look, dogs have this sense.

1151
01:03:30,038 --> 01:03:31,606
This team
of Czechs and Germans

1152
01:03:31,639 --> 01:03:33,842
recently discovered
that dogs align themselves

1153
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:37,012
with the earth's magnetic fields
when they poop.

1154
01:03:37,045 --> 01:03:40,983
So, that way is north.

1155
01:03:41,016 --> 01:03:42,885
Are you... My God!

1156
01:03:42,918 --> 01:03:43,952
You're a sicko.

1157
01:03:43,985 --> 01:03:46,922
Nicole, you can join us,

1158
01:03:46,954 --> 01:03:50,125
or you can be a stupid bitch
and follow the crap compass.

1159
01:03:50,157 --> 01:03:52,393
It's your choice.

1160
01:03:52,427 --> 01:03:54,597
Follow a piece
of dog crap or you...

1161
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:56,432
Hard to see the difference.

1162
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:58,200
Good luck not dying.

1163
01:03:58,233 --> 01:04:00,269
Teddy, you have fun
with Queen Blueballs.

1164
01:04:00,302 --> 01:04:01,370
Let's go, Cindy.

1165
01:04:01,402 --> 01:04:02,904
-Cindy!
-Derrick's right.

1166
01:04:07,909 --> 01:04:11,646
Fine, let's go, Teddy.

1167
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:13,148
Let's go.

1168
01:04:31,132 --> 01:04:34,602
<i>Jack, Jack,
do you see her?</i>

1169
01:04:34,635 --> 01:04:36,105
She's not here.

1170
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:51,120
Hello?

1171
01:04:51,152 --> 01:04:52,654
No, he... hold on,
hold on one second.

1172
01:04:52,688 --> 01:04:54,023
It's Hector!

1173
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:56,425
Tell him
I'll call him back.

1174
01:04:56,458 --> 01:04:57,927
I lost him.

1175
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,929
Wait, I have Paxton's and...

1176
01:05:04,699 --> 01:05:06,034
What is this?

1177
01:05:10,005 --> 01:05:11,340
Damn you, Ritter!

1178
01:05:12,606 --> 01:05:14,409
<i>That's affirmative.</i>

1179
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:15,544
Yes, sir.

1180
01:05:15,577 --> 01:05:17,980
Yes, sir.
I pray so.

1181
01:05:18,012 --> 01:05:20,982
Gladstone, Schiffman...
The governor is sending everyone

1182
01:05:21,016 --> 01:05:22,952
below the 10 South
above the 10 North.

1183
01:05:22,985 --> 01:05:24,153
You have your evacuation.

1184
01:05:24,186 --> 01:05:25,321
Now if there's anything
that we can do,

1185
01:05:25,353 --> 01:05:27,021
I need you to tell me
that right now.

1186
01:05:27,054 --> 01:05:28,523
Excuse me for one second.
I just have to grab this.

1187
01:05:28,556 --> 01:05:29,557
Hello?

1188
01:05:31,492 --> 01:05:32,628
<i>We're not
going to be able to stop</i>

1189
01:05:32,661 --> 01:05:34,195
<i>all of the looting.</i>

1190
01:05:34,228 --> 01:05:36,097
<i>-Sir?
-National Guard...</i>

1191
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:38,166
Yes. What is it now?

1192
01:05:38,199 --> 01:05:39,434
I'm afraid you're going to
have to ask everyone

1193
01:05:39,467 --> 01:05:40,502
to turn around.

1194
01:05:47,641 --> 01:05:49,043
It's too unstable.

1195
01:05:49,077 --> 01:05:51,146
We're looking at
millions of lawsuits.

1196
01:05:51,179 --> 01:05:53,715
Stop being Jack's
little lackey.

1197
01:05:53,748 --> 01:05:56,351
At this depth, we're gonna
strike so much oil,

1198
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:59,054
we can pay off any
government agency or whoever.

1199
01:05:59,086 --> 01:06:00,389
I'm not worried.

1200
01:06:00,422 --> 01:06:02,324
You're the only one
in L.A. who isn't.

1201
01:06:02,356 --> 01:06:04,726
<i>One more detonation, sir,
then we'll turn on the pump.</i>

1202
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:05,728
<i>One hour.</i>

1203
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:09,130
Sir, please don't do this.

1204
01:06:09,164 --> 01:06:12,167
Hector, relax,
my man, all right?

1205
01:06:12,199 --> 01:06:14,502
Grab yourself
a glass of champagne

1206
01:06:14,536 --> 01:06:16,405
and enjoy the show.

1207
01:06:50,704 --> 01:06:52,040
<i>We know
the Long Beach station</i>

1208
01:06:52,074 --> 01:06:53,509
set off the first set
of fissures,

1209
01:06:53,541 --> 01:06:55,576
<i>but Ritter's station
in the National Forest</i>

1210
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:57,246
<i>looks to be much deeper.</i>

1211
01:06:57,278 --> 01:06:58,746
<i>There's a chance
we could crack the mantle.</i>

1212
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:00,816
That will set off even more
dramatic quakes north of the city.

1213
01:07:00,849 --> 01:07:02,518
That's right
in the direction

1214
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:04,186
we're sending half the people
we're evacuating.

1215
01:07:04,219 --> 01:07:05,820
You're focusing on
the little problems again.

1216
01:07:05,853 --> 01:07:08,156
How is falling into the ocean
a little problem?

1217
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:10,425
Falling into
a lake of fire it is...

1218
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:12,627
At that depth, we're getting
into pyroclastic flow.

1219
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:14,163
Pyro what?

1220
01:07:14,195 --> 01:07:17,298
Super-heated gas pushes
molten rock to the surface.

1221
01:07:17,331 --> 01:07:19,567
Fissures that deep
could expel magma

1222
01:07:19,601 --> 01:07:21,769
at 450 miles per hour.

1223
01:07:21,802 --> 01:07:23,304
Magma?
You telling me

1224
01:07:23,338 --> 01:07:25,441
L.A. is about to become
a goddamn volcano?

1225
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:28,309
Well, I wouldn't phrase it
exactly like that, but yes.

1226
01:07:28,342 --> 01:07:31,346
Either way, we cannot let
that station come online.

1227
01:07:48,896 --> 01:07:51,299
I can't believe
she took that dork's side.

1228
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:53,469
How stupid can one girl be?

1229
01:07:53,501 --> 01:07:54,735
I don't know. How?

1230
01:07:54,768 --> 01:07:56,871
What?

1231
01:07:56,905 --> 01:08:00,609
I mean, yeah,
Nicole's totally stupid.

1232
01:08:00,641 --> 01:08:02,510
They both are.

1233
01:08:02,543 --> 01:08:04,312
I think my nose is broken.

1234
01:08:07,282 --> 01:08:11,820
So, what are you going to do
if there's bears in here?

1235
01:08:11,853 --> 01:08:13,555
I'm gonna
trip you and run.

1236
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:17,693
You better protect me.

1237
01:08:17,725 --> 01:08:18,693
We'll see.

1238
01:08:26,902 --> 01:08:27,903
Keep it charged.

1239
01:08:27,935 --> 01:08:29,137
Carry a spare battery.

1240
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:30,739
Blah, blah, blah.

1241
01:08:30,771 --> 01:08:32,608
If my dad had just
nagged me a little more.

1242
01:08:34,876 --> 01:08:36,645
I, I have a thought.

1243
01:08:36,677 --> 01:08:39,715
I read online that you can
charge a cell battery

1244
01:08:39,747 --> 01:08:41,215
with your body heat.

1245
01:08:41,248 --> 01:08:42,617
How's that
going to work, Teddy?

1246
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:44,286
We're both freezing.

1247
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:46,655
Well, if we put the battery
between us

1248
01:08:46,688 --> 01:08:47,890
and then warm
each other up, then...

1249
01:08:47,922 --> 01:08:49,157
Nice try, perv.

1250
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:51,359
I said warm up,
not feel up.

1251
01:08:51,393 --> 01:08:52,461
Come on.

1252
01:08:52,493 --> 01:08:54,228
It might work.

1253
01:08:54,261 --> 01:08:58,166
All right. I can't believe
I'm going to do this.

1254
01:08:58,199 --> 01:08:59,667
Hands above the equator.

1255
01:08:59,701 --> 01:09:00,636
Just, yeah, yeah.

1256
01:09:05,907 --> 01:09:08,944
Wiggle a bit.

1257
01:09:08,976 --> 01:09:10,311
Wiggle?

1258
01:09:11,746 --> 01:09:13,315
Okay.

1259
01:09:17,652 --> 01:09:18,721
Okay.

1260
01:09:23,858 --> 01:09:26,494
Sorry.
Yeah.

1261
01:09:31,966 --> 01:09:34,869
The '89 San Francisco quake
was caused by a split

1262
01:09:34,903 --> 01:09:36,704
<i>along the San Andreas fault.</i>

1263
01:09:36,738 --> 01:09:41,476
Coincidentally, that epicenter
was in a state park forest, too.

1264
01:09:41,509 --> 01:09:42,210
Right.

1265
01:09:42,243 --> 01:09:44,313
That one was caused
by the MLB.

1266
01:09:44,345 --> 01:09:45,613
Major League Baseball?

1267
01:09:45,646 --> 01:09:48,583
Just the Oakland A's
versus the Giants.

1268
01:09:48,617 --> 01:09:50,284
Battle in the Bay.

1269
01:09:50,318 --> 01:09:53,222
No East Coast viewership,
worst television ratings ever,

1270
01:09:53,255 --> 01:09:55,489
so the commissioner
of baseball devised 12...

1271
01:09:55,523 --> 01:09:57,259
Just shut up!

1272
01:09:57,292 --> 01:10:00,896
I've had just about enough
of you running your mouth.

1273
01:10:00,929 --> 01:10:03,632
The Bash Brothers...
Conseco and McGuire...

1274
01:10:03,664 --> 01:10:06,467
Were genetically engineered
super soldiers...

1275
01:10:06,501 --> 01:10:07,636
Just shut it!

1276
01:10:07,668 --> 01:10:11,573
You are playing the quiet game
for the rest of the flight.

1277
01:10:19,546 --> 01:10:20,681
Here.

1278
01:10:20,715 --> 01:10:22,484
Let me check it.

1279
01:10:22,516 --> 01:10:24,353
God!
I hope this worked.

1280
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:33,761
Come on!

1281
01:10:35,963 --> 01:10:37,265
<i>Man.</i>

1282
01:10:40,001 --> 01:10:41,570
Yeah.
You like to play rough?

1283
01:10:41,603 --> 01:10:42,637
Yeah, I do.

1284
01:10:42,671 --> 01:10:43,672
Yeah.

1285
01:10:47,742 --> 01:10:49,645
What's the dog doing?

1286
01:10:56,318 --> 01:10:57,953
My God!
Did you feel that?

1287
01:10:57,985 --> 01:10:59,387
Yeah!

1288
01:11:07,595 --> 01:11:08,797
Listen...

1289
01:11:08,829 --> 01:11:10,332
Yeah, yeah.

1290
01:11:16,671 --> 01:11:18,340
Come on.

1291
01:11:20,708 --> 01:11:21,943
-Derrick...
-Yeah.

1292
01:11:21,975 --> 01:11:22,943
No, get off.

1293
01:11:22,976 --> 01:11:23,912
Yeah, almost.

1294
01:11:28,615 --> 01:11:31,019
Derrick, Derrick,
get off of me!

1295
01:11:31,051 --> 01:11:32,753
No.
Not you, too.

1296
01:11:32,787 --> 01:11:34,722
Really?
There's no way.

1297
01:11:34,756 --> 01:11:35,791
Come on!

1298
01:11:37,692 --> 01:11:39,694
Wait, look, it's on!

1299
01:11:39,728 --> 01:11:40,796
My God, yes.

1300
01:11:50,137 --> 01:11:51,806
Nicole!

1301
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,342
Nicole, are you out there?

1302
01:11:56,110 --> 01:12:00,581
Look, Steph,
I know I always blamed you.

1303
01:12:00,614 --> 01:12:04,019
I blamed Ritter,
I blamed the job,

1304
01:12:04,051 --> 01:12:06,721
but it was me.

1305
01:12:06,755 --> 01:12:09,757
I'm the one who put
our family at risk.

1306
01:12:09,791 --> 01:12:11,393
We'll find her.

1307
01:12:11,426 --> 01:12:13,495
Our daughter
is quite resourceful.

1308
01:12:15,596 --> 01:12:17,498
I'm sure we will.
I know we will,

1309
01:12:17,532 --> 01:12:20,635
but that's not
what I'm trying to say.

1310
01:12:20,667 --> 01:12:23,505
But I, I always hoped
for a big payday,

1311
01:12:23,537 --> 01:12:28,008
that that would solve
all of our problems...

1312
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:32,448
Jack, we never asked you to.

1313
01:12:33,782 --> 01:12:38,086
Listen, I... I take
some of the blame.

1314
01:12:38,118 --> 01:12:40,087
I mean, I hammered
you pretty hard

1315
01:12:40,121 --> 01:12:42,757
for not
being there for us.

1316
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:43,726
I know that.

1317
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:52,000
It's obvious that you were
always putting us first.

1318
01:12:52,033 --> 01:12:53,836
You bet your sweet
babookie I did.

1319
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:03,545
Do you know
a Theodore Toblosky?

1320
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:17,559
Light it up, T.J.

1321
01:13:20,194 --> 01:13:21,630
It's magic time.

1322
01:13:35,243 --> 01:13:37,979
Look, is that them?
It's them!

1323
01:13:38,011 --> 01:13:40,916
It's them!
It's my dad's truck!

1324
01:13:40,948 --> 01:13:41,949
Mom, Dad!

1325
01:13:45,153 --> 01:13:47,989
Nicole, Nicole.
Thank God. Thank God!

1326
01:13:48,021 --> 01:13:49,123
Put this on.

1327
01:13:49,157 --> 01:13:50,859
Are you all right?
Is everything okay?

1328
01:13:50,891 --> 01:13:52,159
Okay, kids,
let's get in the car.

1329
01:13:52,193 --> 01:13:53,929
No, no.
We have to go to the station.

1330
01:13:53,962 --> 01:13:55,797
Hector said that Ritter
was going to turn that thing on

1331
01:13:55,829 --> 01:13:57,498
and start another
giant earthquake.

1332
01:13:57,532 --> 01:13:59,568
I need to get you and the kids
to safety, okay?

1333
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,969
Well, if he turns it on,
are any of us really safe?

1334
01:14:02,002 --> 01:14:03,604
We have to go!

1335
01:14:03,637 --> 01:14:09,243
Sir, if this is a chance
to save L.A., I'm definitely in.

1336
01:14:09,277 --> 01:14:11,480
Me, too.

1337
01:14:11,512 --> 01:14:12,881
Okay. Get in the car.
Let's go!

1338
01:14:12,913 --> 01:14:14,782
Come on! Quick.

1339
01:14:50,217 --> 01:14:53,287
Yeah, I just talked to him.
It's not good.

1340
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:54,689
<i>-Which way?
-This way!</i>

1341
01:14:59,627 --> 01:15:02,697
Ritter! Ritter!

1342
01:15:02,729 --> 01:15:04,298
Turn it off.
Don't be an idiot!

1343
01:15:04,332 --> 01:15:07,869
All right. USGS.
You're under arrest.

1344
01:15:12,739 --> 01:15:14,009
Hey, Ritter,
turn it off.

1345
01:15:15,342 --> 01:15:17,912
Get out of my way.

1346
01:15:17,945 --> 01:15:20,681
I know my rights.
I did nothing wrong.

1347
01:15:20,715 --> 01:15:21,917
We've got
to shut down the pumps.

1348
01:15:21,949 --> 01:15:23,751
No, no, we have to
turn it up all the way.

1349
01:15:23,784 --> 01:15:24,719
What?

1350
01:15:24,752 --> 01:15:26,721
We use your hydraulic pump

1351
01:15:26,753 --> 01:15:29,157
to expand the original
fissure point here.

1352
01:15:29,189 --> 01:15:32,893
Amplify the initial fault
to constrain the epicenter.

1353
01:15:32,926 --> 01:15:34,028
It's my theory.

1354
01:15:34,061 --> 01:15:35,095
It's a good plan.

1355
01:15:35,128 --> 01:15:36,197
I need your help.

1356
01:15:36,229 --> 01:15:38,132
If we can centralize
the pressure

1357
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:39,167
building up in the crust...

1358
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:40,868
Hold on.

1359
01:15:40,902 --> 01:15:42,304
The create a bigger
earthquake plan...

1360
01:15:42,337 --> 01:15:43,838
Excuse me, miss.

1361
01:15:43,871 --> 01:15:45,673
Didn't you just say
that idea was nuts?

1362
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:47,242
That was an hour ago.
Now it's all we've got...

1363
01:15:47,274 --> 01:15:49,210
And it's not "miss."
It's Doctor.

1364
01:15:49,243 --> 01:15:51,580
I'm sorry.
I still don't follow.

1365
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:52,747
The fault lines
are radiating,

1366
01:15:52,779 --> 01:15:55,684
and the epicenter
is losing pressure.

1367
01:15:55,716 --> 01:15:56,951
And you want to
fracture it more?

1368
01:15:56,984 --> 01:15:58,219
Precisely.

1369
01:15:58,252 --> 01:16:00,055
We use your pumps
at maximum pressure

1370
01:16:00,087 --> 01:16:03,657
to localize the venting
of this fissure.

1371
01:16:03,690 --> 01:16:04,693
That's insane!

1372
01:16:04,725 --> 01:16:06,027
This place will become
unstable.

1373
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:07,963
The forest will break
into a million pieces.

1374
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:09,730
No, I think
that's the point, right?

1375
01:16:12,399 --> 01:16:13,667
What are you doing?

1376
01:16:13,701 --> 01:16:15,103
We need to
maximize these pumps.

1377
01:16:15,136 --> 01:16:16,738
Turn it off Jack.
Don't do it!

1378
01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:18,172
Would you just get this guy
out of here?

1379
01:16:18,206 --> 01:16:21,810
Right now I'm not 100% sure
who I should be locking up.

1380
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:26,681
Okay.

1381
01:16:26,713 --> 01:16:28,949
<i>I repeat,
The City of Los Angeles...</i>

1382
01:16:28,983 --> 01:16:30,051
Wait, wait, wait.

1383
01:16:30,083 --> 01:16:31,251
Get out of my way!

1384
01:16:31,284 --> 01:16:32,953
<i>Mandatory evacuation order.</i>

1385
01:16:32,987 --> 01:16:35,891
<i>Coastal areas
are under a tsunami warning.</i>

1386
01:16:37,891 --> 01:16:40,194
<i>Coastal areas
are under a tsunami warning.</i>

1387
01:16:40,228 --> 01:16:42,064
This... this isn't happening.

1388
01:16:48,903 --> 01:16:51,873
My God!
What have I done?

1389
01:16:51,905 --> 01:16:53,841
<i>Are you saying
you could stop this earthquake?</i>

1390
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:56,744
No, no, certainly not.

1391
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:58,980
We might be able
to move it, though.

1392
01:16:59,012 --> 01:17:00,814
Good.
Where?

1393
01:17:00,847 --> 01:17:02,250
To right beneath our feet.

1394
01:17:07,788 --> 01:17:10,090
I see all kinds of gases
in the backflow system.

1395
01:17:10,123 --> 01:17:11,859
These outflow pipes
aren't going to hold.

1396
01:17:11,893 --> 01:17:13,028
<i>Well, then,
that's good, though.</i>

1397
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:15,229
We want everything down there
to fracture.

1398
01:17:15,262 --> 01:17:17,097
Let 'rip!

1399
01:17:17,131 --> 01:17:18,100
Okay.

1400
01:17:23,070 --> 01:17:24,905
You ready?

1401
01:17:45,025 --> 01:17:46,060
Damn it!

1402
01:17:46,094 --> 01:17:47,228
What is it?
What?

1403
01:17:47,261 --> 01:17:48,997
It's not building
any pressure.

1404
01:17:49,029 --> 01:17:52,833
The emergency shutdown valve...
If the system got overloaded,

1405
01:17:52,867 --> 01:17:55,136
it... it must have engaged.

1406
01:17:55,168 --> 01:17:56,805
It definitely got overloaded.

1407
01:17:56,837 --> 01:18:00,074
Okay, we have to we have
to open the valve manually.

1408
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:01,842
You saw what happened
to Paxton and Hicks

1409
01:18:01,876 --> 01:18:03,078
when they tried to
open that valve.

1410
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:04,345
I'm not going
down there again.

1411
01:18:04,377 --> 01:18:06,081
We don't have a choice, okay?

1412
01:18:06,113 --> 01:18:08,182
Look, we've got
at least 10 minutes

1413
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:13,354
before all hell breaks loose...
Five minutes minimum.

1414
01:18:13,386 --> 01:18:14,722
Come on!

1415
01:18:14,756 --> 01:18:15,856
<i>Diosito mio!</i>

1416
01:18:25,265 --> 01:18:27,101
Do you think
he stopped it?

1417
01:18:27,135 --> 01:18:28,837
I have no idea.

1418
01:18:31,271 --> 01:18:32,506
Hey, guys.

1419
01:18:32,539 --> 01:18:34,743
Who wants to go
for a helicopter ride?

1420
01:18:38,179 --> 01:18:40,114
Look, I don't know about this.

1421
01:18:40,148 --> 01:18:42,050
Maybe I should rethink
this whole thing because...

1422
01:18:42,082 --> 01:18:44,284
Lieutenant, what's the worst
thing that can happen?

1423
01:18:44,318 --> 01:18:47,788
We can turn a pristine
national forest into a volcano

1424
01:18:47,822 --> 01:18:49,090
or is that
another little problem?

1425
01:18:49,122 --> 01:18:50,357
It is.

1426
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:51,492
We're going to lose
the entire city,

1427
01:18:51,525 --> 01:18:53,327
so what's a few thousand trees?

1428
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:56,530
It's kind of like whining over
a scratched tail light

1429
01:18:56,564 --> 01:18:58,333
on a totaled Ferrari.

1430
01:19:00,902 --> 01:19:02,237
Go!

1431
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:03,438
I love you.

1432
01:19:03,470 --> 01:19:05,306
Jack, isn't there
any other way?

1433
01:19:09,476 --> 01:19:11,212
I'll be right back.

1434
01:19:12,579 --> 01:19:14,815
You bet your sweet
babookie you will!

1435
01:19:16,516 --> 01:19:17,551
You ready?

1436
01:19:17,585 --> 01:19:18,836
I guess.

1437
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:20,087
Wait, wait!

1438
01:19:20,121 --> 01:19:22,023
I'm the one
who altered the drill

1439
01:19:22,055 --> 01:19:23,791
and ignored the warnings.

1440
01:19:23,824 --> 01:19:25,793
It's my fault.

1441
01:19:25,827 --> 01:19:27,195
His fault.
You know, it's funny

1442
01:19:27,228 --> 01:19:30,364
because he started
all the shifts in the faults.

1443
01:19:30,398 --> 01:19:32,534
Never mind.

1444
01:19:32,567 --> 01:19:34,569
Let me go
instead of Hector.

1445
01:19:34,601 --> 01:19:36,104
I'm cool with that.

1446
01:19:36,136 --> 01:19:38,239
All right,
knock yourself out, hot shot!

1447
01:19:39,472 --> 01:19:41,141
Let's go!

1448
01:19:41,175 --> 01:19:42,144
Wait!

1449
01:19:48,481 --> 01:19:49,951
Come on!

1450
01:19:49,984 --> 01:19:50,919
Jack!

1451
01:19:55,088 --> 01:19:55,990
Hey!

1452
01:19:58,626 --> 01:20:00,328
This doesn't change anything.

1453
01:20:01,895 --> 01:20:04,032
You still deserve to die.

1454
01:20:16,644 --> 01:20:19,079
It's going to be hot
down there.

1455
01:20:30,358 --> 01:20:32,327
The release valve's
about 20 yards away.

1456
01:20:37,931 --> 01:20:39,099
It's on the right here.

1457
01:20:41,368 --> 01:20:43,237
Damn! Hot!

1458
01:20:46,039 --> 01:20:47,274
This ain't
going to be easy.

1459
01:20:47,307 --> 01:20:48,275
No, sir.

1460
01:20:55,416 --> 01:20:56,885
Damn!

1461
01:21:05,292 --> 01:21:06,293
All right.
Let's go!

1462
01:21:10,096 --> 01:21:12,000
Damn it!

1463
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:13,268
Pressure valve
is still on.

1464
01:21:13,301 --> 01:21:16,237
Help me turn it again
and I'll hold it open.

1465
01:21:16,270 --> 01:21:20,208
Look, I wasn't serious
about you being dead.

1466
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:22,644
Hey, once I get back
in that helicopter,

1467
01:21:22,676 --> 01:21:24,945
I'm a dead man anyway.

1468
01:21:24,979 --> 01:21:26,414
Let's do this.
Come on!

1469
01:21:28,114 --> 01:21:29,283
Come on!

1470
01:21:38,591 --> 01:21:40,327
Now get out of here!

1471
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:42,329
You know I don't like
to pay you overtime.

1472
01:21:53,573 --> 01:21:54,942
Where are they?

1473
01:21:54,975 --> 01:21:56,944
They should have
opened it by now.

1474
01:21:56,978 --> 01:21:58,313
We can't wait much longer.

1475
01:21:58,345 --> 01:22:01,648
Wait, just give him a minute.
I know he's coming.

1476
01:23:04,612 --> 01:23:05,712
There he is!

1477
01:23:05,746 --> 01:23:07,315
Dad, look out!

1478
01:23:09,783 --> 01:23:11,585
Dad, look out!

1479
01:23:18,692 --> 01:23:20,728
Where's... where's Ritter?

1480
01:23:20,761 --> 01:23:22,063
He didn't make it.

1481
01:23:22,095 --> 01:23:23,296
Come on,
let's get out of here!

1482
01:23:23,329 --> 01:23:24,731
Wait, wait, wait.
Here, boy!

1483
01:23:24,765 --> 01:23:27,301
Come on, come on.

1484
01:23:27,333 --> 01:23:29,537
Come on, boy!

1485
01:23:51,257 --> 01:23:54,194
Terminating aftershocks
are being felt

1486
01:23:54,228 --> 01:23:56,663
throughout
Los Angeles County.

1487
01:23:56,697 --> 01:23:58,065
Wha-what does that mean?

1488
01:23:58,099 --> 01:24:00,435
It means it worked...
We did it!

1489
01:24:00,467 --> 01:24:01,502
We did it!

1490
01:24:06,606 --> 01:24:07,609
I knew it would work!

1491
01:24:10,644 --> 01:24:12,613
Pretty miserable day?

1492
01:24:12,645 --> 01:24:15,849
Not so bad.
I got to second base.

1493
01:24:17,685 --> 01:24:19,287
Looks like
I'm out of a job.

1494
01:24:22,422 --> 01:24:23,724
I'm sure I could find
some stuff

1495
01:24:23,756 --> 01:24:25,559
for you to do
around the house.

1496
01:24:33,333 --> 01:24:34,335
Wait!

1497
01:24:34,368 --> 01:24:35,837
We've got to stop
for cheesecake!
