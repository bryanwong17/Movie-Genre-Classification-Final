He put his stuff
in an empty one.

Why didn't you tell me?

You watched the same
security footage as I did.

1117
00:58:53,307 --> 00:58:54,974
I was just waiting to see
who was gonna come

1118
00:58:54,976 --> 00:58:56,445
and look for Makmoud's stuff.

1119
00:58:57,146 --> 00:58:58,381

off the satellite

If it were,
they wouldn't have killed him.

It's, uh,
worse than we thought.

1163
01:00:40,983 --> 01:00:44,850
Whoever's doing this is using
Dutch Boy to target cities.

1164
01:00:44,852 --> 01:00:47,854
Yeah, they're disguising their
moves as malfunctions.

1165
01:00:47,856 --> 01:00:50,090
They already killed the man
who found out about this

1166
01:00:50,092 --> 01:00:51,892
and I don't think
they're done.

(SIGHS) You know,
they said it was impossible,

1170

but we pulled it off.

1171
01:01:00,135 --> 01:01:01,334
And it worked

01:01:08,776 --> 01:01:10,510

01:01:16,851 --> 01:01:18,485
I need you.
I need you to tell me,

1181
01:01:18,487 --> 01:01:19,753
how are they controlling
Dutch Boy?

1182
01:01:19,755 --> 01:01:21,021

<i>Well, can you stop it?</i>

1186
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:26,492
JAKE: There's only one way.

1187
01:01:26,494 --> 01:01:29,796
We can shut down
Dutch Boy temporarily.

1188
01:01:29,798 --> 01:01:32,066
The reboot will flush out
the system,

1189
01:01:32,068 --> 01:01:33,499
kill the virus,
and revert back

1190
01:01:33,501 --> 01:01:35,468
to the fail-safe OS.

1191
01:01:35,470 --> 01:01:38,939
Okay. Let's do it.

1192
01:01:38,941 --> 01:01:40,307
I'm authorizing.

1193
01:01:40,309 --> 01:01:41,474
Yeah, I think
we've established that

1194
01:01:41,476 --> 01:01:43,744
I don't really wait for that.

1195
01:01:43,746 --> 01:01:45,044
This isn't a Chromebook.

1196
01:01:45,046 --> 01:01:46,445
You don't just put your finger
on the power button.

1197
01:01:46,447 --> 01:01:47,883
You need the kill codes.

1198
01:01:49,418 --> 01:01:52,385
And the only one who has those
is the president.

1199
01:01:52,387 --> 01:01:53,519
So let's just go
to the president

1200
01:01:53,521 --> 01:01:54,620
and tell him what we know.

1201
01:01:54,622 --> 01:01:58,258
No. You can't go to Palma.

1202
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:00,492
<i>We need way more proof
than I have.</i>

1203
01:02:00,494 --> 01:02:02,128
We're talking about
shutting down Dutch Boy.

1204
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:03,296
I mean, even for an hour,

1205
01:02:03,298 --> 01:02:04,731
that puts
the whole planet at risk.

1206
01:02:04,733 --> 01:02:06,934
No, I don't think
you understand.

1207
01:02:06,936 --> 01:02:09,369
Someone sealed off
the backdoor into the system.

1208
01:02:09,371 --> 01:02:12,905
A backdoor almost no one
knew existed.

1209
01:02:12,907 --> 01:02:14,407
But the president did.

1210
01:02:14,409 --> 01:02:18,479
No. Jake, come on. What?
Are you out of your mind?

1211
01:02:18,481 --> 01:02:21,548
Not saying it's him.
I'm saying, "What if?"

1212
01:02:21,550 --> 01:02:24,718
Who else has the resources
to pull this off?

1213
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:28,120
Murder, cover-up, and a virus
that can only be stopped

1214
01:02:28,122 --> 01:02:29,756
with the codes in his pocket.

1215
01:02:29,758 --> 01:02:32,392
Why? Huh? Tell me, why?
Why would he do that?

1216
01:02:32,394 --> 01:02:33,894
We're two weeks away

1217
01:02:33,896 --> 01:02:35,994
from transferring Dutch Boy
to the rest of the world.

1218
01:02:35,996 --> 01:02:38,965
Two weeks away from losing
autonomous control.

1219
01:02:38,967 --> 01:02:40,233
Now, he talks a good game,

1220
01:02:40,235 --> 01:02:41,671
but he's never gonna
let it happen.

1221
01:02:42,938 --> 01:02:44,436
A series of disasters,

1222
01:02:44,438 --> 01:02:46,405
an international crew
to take the fall

1223
01:02:46,407 --> 01:02:47,907
and he'll have to cancel
the handoff.

1224
01:02:47,909 --> 01:02:49,778
And who would blame him?

1225
01:02:51,113 --> 01:02:54,584
All right. You stay on top
of your satellites.

Us?

You're asking me to help you

who you haven't even spoken to

01:03:46,936 --> 01:03:50,269
Yeah. Think about it.

Look, you gotta trust me
on this, all right?

01:03:57,079 --> 01:03:58,381
I'm not kidding around here.

1251
01:03:59,414 --> 01:04:01,347
- Okay.
- Look.

1252
01:04:01,349 --> 01:04:04,452
The codes are
on Palma's HoloFrame.

1253
01:04:05,653 --> 01:04:06,986
We can't do it on the plane.

1254

Why not?

1255
01:04:07,923 --> 01:04:09,722
Too many eyes.
He's never alone.

All right,
then what's the play?

1257
01:04:12,526 --> 01:04:14,428
Palma wants
some private time to shower

before the after-parties.

You follow.
I'll get you inside.
