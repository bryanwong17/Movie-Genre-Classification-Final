1
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,640
It stopped.

2
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,680
What's that, Dave?

3
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,680
Nothing.

4
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,680
How we doing?

5
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,880
Oh, we're ready.

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You feeling the magic?

7
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,800
Oh, I'm feeling the magic,
all right.

8
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,840
Let's hit 'em.

9
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,960
Yeah.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,080
Let's do it.

11
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,040
Here we go.

12
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,320
Let's hit 'em.

13
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,800
Let's go make $30 million.

14
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,640
Good morning.

15
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,680
Before I begin, let me...

16
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,040
David?

17
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,840
I'll go get help.

18
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,360
Jesus. Jesus, David.

19
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,400
Phone 9-1-1. Phone 9-1-1!

20
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,600
David?

21
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,080
Nick?

22
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,080
Vicky?!

23
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,800
Vicky!

24
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,720
Okay, it's okay.

25
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,160
It's okay.

26
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,880
Everybody else off the bus.

27
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,560
Sound waves.

28
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,200
So, if we know that sound waves

29
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,280
gain wavelength
and lose frequency

30
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,480
as they travel
through more dense materials...

31
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,440
...then the anomalies
in these waves

32
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,440
are the means by which
we can surmise

33
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,840
the fundamental architecture
of our planet.

34
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,440
How are the nails coming,
Christine?

35
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,560
Good.

36
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,520
All right,
let's have a demonstration.

37
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,920
Mr. Acker, Veronica.

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,240
Thank you very much.

39
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,760
All right.

40
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,040
Mrs. Limestone,
being a big softie, you know,

41
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,160
loves walks in the park,
bedtime stories,

42
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,120
big romantic.

43
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,160
Loves Chet.

44
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,240
I can't play Chet,
but I'll see what I can do.

45
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,480
Watch the oscilloscope,
all right?

46
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
Here we go.

47
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,840
Dr. Joshua Keyes?

48
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,200
Maybe.

49
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,800
Yes or no, sir?

50
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,720
The first one.

51
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,280
Please come with us, sir.

52
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,840
Guys, wh-what's going on?

53
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,320
We don't know, sir.

54
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,360
What do you mean,
you don't know?

55
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,080
Your security clearance
is higher than ours.

56
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,720
I have security clearance?

57
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,800
We're just here to
bring you to your jet.

58
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,840
I have a jet?

59
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,760
Hey, Serge.

60
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,000
Ah!

61
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,960
Serge.

62
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,960
Serge.

63
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,080
Damn!

64
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,120
It's about time.
You're always late.

65
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,560
Let's keep moving, gentlemen.

66
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,680
What am I doing here?

67
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,880
They wouldn't brief me
until you got here.

68
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,640
You know, there are biochemists
everywhere, military.

69
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,920
I hate them.

70
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,520
When are you going to meet
a nice girl

71
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,640
and bring her for dinner?

72
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,640
I'm married to my work.

73
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,800
So am I.

74
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,280
Which makes my wife
my mistress...

75
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,080
that's why I'm still
in love with her.

76
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,640
You were always a romantic.

77
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,760
I love my wife.

78
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,360
Yeah, I know.
I love your wife, too.

79
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,640
I know.

80
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,640
But I don't love your wife.
You know what I mean.

81
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,360
You don't love her
the same way, you know.

82
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,720
It's the French.
I think it's the cheese.

83
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,000
Ah, the cheese.

84
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,760
You're...
you're teasing me, right?

85
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,200
Oh, my...!

86
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,960
Whoa. Wait, these are bodies.

87
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,720
I think we're
in the wrong place here.

88
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,120
Yeah, we're in the wrong place.

89
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,040
No. If you were
in the wrong place,

90
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,840
you would've already been shot.

91
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,960
That's a hell of a greeting.

92
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,360
Serge.

93
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,600
Serge.

94
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,920
Serge. Yes.
Always a pleasure.

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,040
Same here, Thomas.

96
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,160
Dr. Keyes.

97
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,560
- I know.
- Tom Purcell.

98
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,120
Gentlemen, you do realize
that everything here

99
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,840
is totally classified, okay?

100
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,680
At 10:30 a.m. Local time,

101
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,400
32 civilians,
all within a 10-block radius...

102
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,440
died.

103
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,200
They didn't get sick first.

104
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,240
They simply hit the ground dead.

105
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,200
Nerve agent?

106
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,160
Our first guess. No.

107
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,000
They all died
at the same time?

108
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,240
As far as we can tell,
to the second.

109
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,600
This hits CNN in one hour.

110
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,880
I need a reason.

111
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,320
Is there a variation
in sex, age, body type?

112
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,920
They all had pacemakers.

113
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,640
Under a minute.

114
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,960
Your reputation is
well deserved.

115
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,800
- Hey, hey, hey.
- How did you guess?

116
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,200
Without any clues
from the victims?

117
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,160
No, that's...

118
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,360
Serge and I are the clues.

119
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,480
I mean, he specializes
in high energy weapons.

120
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,440
I do geomagnetics.

121
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,920
So calling us means you suspect

122
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,360
an electromagnetic
pulse weapon.

123
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,120
If these are
the only fatalities,

124
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,120
they must be people
susceptible to...

125
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,440
electronic interference.

126
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,520
QED pacemakers.

127
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,200
You're spooky sometimes, eh?

128
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,440
Now I need to know,

129
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,760
did some sort of weapon
kill these people?

130
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,840
The power that you would need

131
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,320
to create an EM pulse
strong enough...

132
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,960
I mean, that's...
that's not a weapon that

133
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,080
- I've ever heard of.
- No.

134
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,360
Okay, we're done.

135
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,280
We're not done, sir.

136
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,760
There's nothing on the other
side of the equal sign.

137
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
I agree with Joshua...

138
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,160
Thank you.

139
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,480
Our greatest concern was this
may have been an act of war,

140
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,760
but since it's not,

141
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,480
I think we can all breathe
a little easier, can't we?

142
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,800
Look at my hat.

143
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,200
What is it, sweetheart?

144
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,240
It's okay, son.

145
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,920
These things happen
all the time and...

146
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,840
Let's, go, let's go!
Come on!

147
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,760
Justin!

148
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,240
Watch out, you bloody idiot!

149
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Hurry! Run!

150
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,280
Daddy!

151
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,680
The skies are empty
over Nelson's Column now,

152
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,040
but a few hours ago,
it was a different story.

153
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,880
Eyewitnesses claimed that
the frenzied swarms of birds

154
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,520
were not in fact attacking
people deliberately...

155
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,440
And it's not just this time.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

156
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,960
But seemed to be confused
and flying blind.

157
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,640
The <i>Fortean Times</i> reported
violent bird swarms

158
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,120
twice last month in
Australia and Japan.

159
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,040
Five people are confirmed dead
and dozens injured

160
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,560
in the panic that followed the
bizarre and terrifying incident

161
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,080
in London's historic
Trafalgar Square.

162
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,240
- Weird.
- Mm-hmm.

163
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,560
Quite strange, also.

164
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,560
Mm. Strange, indeed.

165
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,960
Mm!

166
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,000
How do birds navigate?

167
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,160
By sight?

168
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,800
No, no, no,
the long range stuff.

169
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,800
Magnetic fields.

170
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,120
Little ions in their brains

171
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,240
align with the magnetic field
of the Earth.

172
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,560
- Yeah, what she said.
- Right?

173
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,680
Acker.

174
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,600
Hit the 'Net, do a search for...

175
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,360
oh, two years ought to do it.

176
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,240
Any and all, like, "weird news",
you know...

177
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,480
bizarre animal migrations,

178
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,880
specifically birds.

179
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,240
Whale and dolphin beachings.

180
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,280
Unusual atmospheric phenomenon,
unexplained plane crashes,

181
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,360
you know,
just use your imagination.

182
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,880
That is a huge search.

183
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,000
You can use our T-1 line
to look up Sailor Moon crap.

184
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,360
You're up to this.

185
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,800
Danni, Danni,
get me the brightest kids

186
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,040
from the Field Theory Class,

187
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,200
and design a computer model
of an electromagnetic field.

188
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,320
What are we doing?

189
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,920
I need a 3-D computer model
of the Earth

190
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,880
to lay the field over.

191
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,000
Whoa-ho-ho, the planet Earth?

192
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,560
Yeah, the planet Earth.
You know, the pretty blue one.

193
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,440
Map out the anomalies
that Acker finds

194
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,960
and grunt out the equations.

195
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,960
And, uh...

196
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,640
grab those smelly kids

197
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,040
from the Non-Linear
Diff class, too.

198
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,640
Listen, Josh, do we even
have time for this?

199
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,000
Do this and I'll sign
your doctorates blindfolded.

200
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,200
- Blindfolded?
- Blindfolded.

201
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,880
Do not pass Go.
Go directly to PhD.

202
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,440
Be wrong. Be wrong.

203
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,520
Tim, I'm coming in a little hot.

204
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,960
Give me some drag, will you?

205
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,680
Roger that.

206
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,760
We are in attitude and ready
for an entry interface.

207
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,040
Nice work, Major.

208
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,320
I have the controls
now for E.I.

209
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,040
I could take us in.

210
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,280
You could...

211
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,400
but you won't.

212
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,520
I'm ready for this, Bob.

213
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,880
Oh, no, you're not, Beck.

214
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,960
You're trained,
and you're certified...

215
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,720
doesn't make you the commander.

216
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,600
And the commander
lands the bird.

217
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,840
You got to be the youngest
person ever in space.

218
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,560
You should say,
thank you, be happy.

219
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,400
Now.

220
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,760
<i>Endeavour,</i> Houston,
at this time

221
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,440
we show you go for reentry.

222
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,920
Houston, <i>Endeavour</i> descending
through 400,000 feet

223
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,280
coming upon entry interface.

224
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,600
<i>Endeavour,</i> this is Flight.

225
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,200
Weren't able to annoy
the commander

226
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,160
into letting you
bring her in this time?

227
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,120
That's a negative, Stick.

228
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,360
I'll have to be
more annoying next time.

229
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,200
Is that even possible?

230
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,120
<i>Endeavour,</i>

231
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,800
we see you in
good entry config.

232
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,000
Roger, Houston.

233
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,840
Advise.

234
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,400
I'm seeing those
plasma trails now.

235
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,360
All right, mark 24½.

236
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,640
So, a minute to air.

237
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,320
I don't believe in belts.

238
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,080
Just get me through the Earth's
atmosphere in this spaceship.

239
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,160
Com dropout.

240
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,800
Start the I Com.

241
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,360
Let's wait till the...

242
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,120
Com restored.

243
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,160
Quiet!

244
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,200
We are out of position here.

245
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,000
Guidance shows us
on energy and on course.

246
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,400
Well, I've made this approach
213 times in the simulator.

247
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,840
We're not where we should be.

248
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,960
Where the hell are we?

249
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,680
<i>Endeavour,</i> guidance is bad.

250
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,440
You are now
1-2-niner miles off course.

251
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,760
Roger, Houston.
We sort of noticed.

252
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,680
Is that...?

253
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,680
Los Angeles. That is confirmed.

254
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,280
We are 1-5 thousand feet.

255
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,040
We got maybe two minutes
of glide time left.

256
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,040
Doesn't make sense.

257
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,120
The guidance,
the beacons are all wrong?

258
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,440
We're heading straight
for downtown.

259
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,400
We're not going to crash
into Los Angeles.

260
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,800
They're going to hit
downtown L.A.

261
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,800
At 300 knots.

262
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,400
Bob, you know L.A.?
Because I have an idea.

263
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,440
Houston, those buildings
are getting mighty big.

264
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,920
Can you clear a freeway?

265
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,720
Okay, thank you.

266
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,080
Come on. Come on.

267
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,680
It's rush hour, Commander,

268
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,080
and it's bumper-to-bumper.

269
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,000
Sir, I have an alternate.

270
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,240
If you turn to heading 1-7-5...

271
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,600
It's Houston's call. Houston?

272
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,600
Computers are still plotting.

273
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,760
Come on.

274
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,800
Houston, we are running

275
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,920
out of time here.

276
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,640
Sir, I have an alternate.

277
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,640
All right, Beck,
what do you got?

278
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,680
Houston, I have coordinates

279
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,640
for an alternate landing site.

280
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,600
Can you confirm?

281
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,320
<i>Endeavour,</i> give them to me.

282
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,960
I show possible touchdown...
at 33.55 north, 118.10 west.

283
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,360
Bill?

284
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,960
It's theoretically possible.

285
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,800
<i>Endeavour,</i>

286
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,840
that is confirmed.

287
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,760
Turn right, heading 1-7-5.

288
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
Expect visual contact

289
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,000
with Los Angeles River
in five seconds.

290
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,400
No, that will not work, Houston.

291
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,040
We got bridges
every few hundred yards.

292
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,760
Our wingspan alone
is going to fold us up.

293
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,200
I've figured the "L"
over "D" max.

294
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,120
We can make it
if you can bring us straight in.

295
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
We're coming in high and hot.

296
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,000
290 feet, 320.

297
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,000
- 270, 3-0-5...
- Arm the gear.

298
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,120
You're armed.

299
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,840
Gear down. Now.

300
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,600
Gear in transition.

301
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,080
240 feet, 290.

302
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,120
Hang on.
This isn't going to be subtle.

303
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,160
210 feet, 265.

304
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,960
Get out of the way! Move!

305
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,200
Derotate.

306
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,360
Inward.

307
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,200
230... 210...

308
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,600
Speed brakes!

309
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,880
100%.

310
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,160
Oh, we're way too fast.

311
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,280
Deploy the chute.

312
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,040
No. We'd snag the bridge.
We'll tear the tail off.

313
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,520
Banking right.

314
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,000
Commander, that next bridge!

315
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,040
Watch it!

316
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,200
We're way too high
for that one!

317
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,160
Suck up the gear!

318
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,240
Not yet.
We'll lose all steering.

319
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,520
We hit, it's over!

320
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,440
And... gear up now!

321
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,080
Lock your harnesses.
This is out of my hands.

322
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,200
Let's get out of here!

323
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,480
Run! Let's get out!

324
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,520
Dr. Zimsky?!

325
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,640
Will you make sure
my assistant has

326
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,600
your number, darling?

327
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,560
Sure.

328
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,520
- Dr. Zimsky!
- Hello.

329
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,480
I'll call security.

330
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,440
No, it's all right.
It's all right. Hello.

331
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,400
Thank you, sir.

332
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,120
- Dr. Zimsky.
- Yes. What's your name?

333
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,080
- Josh Keyes.
- Josh.

334
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,880
No, sir, I don't need you
to sign it.

335
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,080
I need you to read that.

336
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,440
I'm sorry, I don't have time.

337
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,680
- I'm late for the White House.
- Sir, please.

338
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,400
I need you to confirm
my results, sir.

339
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,640
Young man, do you have any idea
who I am?

340
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,680
Yes, I do, sir.
Please read this.

341
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,840
What's it about?

342
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,040
It's the end of the world.

343
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,080
No, I... this is impossible.
I'm sorry.

344
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,800
I-I-I can't have missed this.

345
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,800
You-You have to be wrong.

346
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,080
I mean, look, I'm sure

347
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,280
with careful comparison
to my own work,

348
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,560
we'll find that
you are mistaken.

349
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,000
No offense, but...

350
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,760
Well, I mean,
we'll know soon enough.

351
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,680
The bigger effects will start up
any day now.

352
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,280
Rebecca?

353
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,880
Only you and Dad
ever call me that.

354
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,640
Well, Beck.

355
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,080
So, what brings you
to sunny D.C.?

356
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,920
The Board of Review
is next week.

357
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,000
Just trying to get a sense
of the mood upstairs.

358
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,160
How bad is it?

359
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,720
Your crew crashed
the space shuttle.

360
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,520
Now, how good do you
think it could be?

361
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,880
Sir, this is my life.

362
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,000
Well...

363
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,200
I was studying for the academy
when I was 13.

364
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,440
It still is and has always been
my life.

365
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,160
It's over.

366
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,280
It's over, Rebecca.

367
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,920
I'm sorry.

368
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,560
It's right down here.

369
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,520
Really?

370
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,440
It's like the 4th of July.

371
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,600
What the hell's the hurry here?

372
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,280
Rebecca, would you excuse me,
please?

373
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,960
Excuse me.

374
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,080
Purcell.

375
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:47,560
Thomas, um, look...

376
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,120
it seems that destiny
may have caught up with us.

377
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,160
Did Zimsky really try
to give you his autograph?

378
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,720
Ah, Monsieur Zimsky.

379
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,800
Conrad Zimsky.

380
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,200
Herr Zimsky.

381
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,560
Superstar.

382
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,120
Oh...

383
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,520
I think I skipped drunk.

384
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,600
Went right to hangover.

385
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,560
Weren't you the one?

386
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,080
I spoke with the kids.

387
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,400
They don't sleep at night.

388
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,360
They look at the sky, and...
and they think it's pretty.

389
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,280
Is there any chance
you're wrong?

390
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,920
No. The sky, man.

391
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,560
The sky... I mean,
that's just the beginning.

392
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,960
That's high-altitude
static discharge.

393
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,840
I know.

394
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,400
Dr. Keyes...

395
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,520
...your presence is
required at the Pentagon.

396
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,960
Ah... it's my best buddies.

397
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,400
Hey!

398
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,280
Why don't you join
us for a drink?

399
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,800
We'd be grateful if you could
join us for a ride, sir.

400
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,600
And if I were to say no?

401
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,960
- Just asking.
- Yeah.

402
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,120
Well, we have
no sense of humor.

403
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,240
That's true.

404
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,400
Oh...

405
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,360
And we're armed.

406
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,800
Thank you.

407
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,160
Dr. Keyes, welcome.

408
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,480
Thank you.

409
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,680
Dr. Zimsky informs us

410
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,600
that you made a
useful contribution

411
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,600
to his investigations,
so he wanted you

412
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,040
to assist him
in the briefing.

413
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,720
That's very generous of you,
Dr. Zimsky.

414
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,000
Science is a selfless business,
dear boy.

415
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,920
Now, why don't you begin,

416
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,560
and I'll fill in
all the difficult bits.

417
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,400
All right, I'll put this
as simply as I can.

418
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,520
Everybody on Earth
is dead in a year.

419
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,040
And let me explain why.

420
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,800
Wrapped around the Earth
is an invisible field of energy.

421
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,480
It's made up of...
electricity and magnetism,

422
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,360
so it's called...
creatively enough...

423
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,800
the electromagnetic field.

424
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,920
It's where we get our magnetic
North Pole and South Pole,

425
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,160
and it protects us
from cosmic radiation.

426
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,920
So this EM field is our friend.

427
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,800
But now...?

428
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,200
But now,

429
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,760
that field is falling apart.

430
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,840
Why?

431
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,440
Why?

432
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,840
This here.

433
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,000
Does somebody have a can
of air freshener?

434
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,400
Quick and dirty.

435
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,240
The thin skin,
that's the Earth's crust.

436
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,920
That's what we live on.

437
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,120
It's 30 miles thick.

438
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,840
The meat here,
call it the mantle.

439
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,600
And forgetting
all the-the funky transitions,

440
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,040
it's 2,000 miles thick.

441
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,440
The core,

442
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,840
the peach pit in the center...
that's a tricky one.

443
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,160
There's two parts...

444
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,640
the inner core
and the outer core.

445
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,640
Are you following me?

446
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,520
The inner core

447
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,440
is, uh...

448
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,400
well, it's a big, solid chunk
of iron,

449
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,520
we think.

450
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,920
And that's surrounded

451
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,080
by the outer core,
and that is liquid.

452
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,400
Yes, but,

453
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,320
most importantly, this liquid
is constantly spinning

454
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,400
in one direction.

455
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,600
So a trillion trillion tons
of hot metal

456
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,920
spinning at
a thousand miles an hour, so...

457
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Right, so Physics 101...

458
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,440
hot metal moving fast
makes an electromagnetic field.

459
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,000
This spinning liquid outer core
is the engine

460
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,880
that drives the EM Field.

461
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,040
And that's where
we have our problem.

462
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,400
This engine has stalled.

463
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,280
The core of the Earth
has stopped spinning.

464
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,880
How could this have happened?

465
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,280
We don't know.

466
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,280
What's the timeline here?

467
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,800
As the EM Field
becomes more and more unstable,

468
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,800
we'll start seeing
isolated incidents.

469
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,320
One plane
will fall from the sky,

470
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,480
and then two, and then...

471
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,920
in a few months, anything...

472
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,760
everything electronic
will be fried.

473
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,240
Static discharges
in the atmosphere

474
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,120
will create "super-storms"
with hundreds

475
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,640
of lightening strikes
per square mile.

476
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,600
After that, it gets bad.

477
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,160
The Earth's EM Field

478
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,240
shields us from the solar winds,
which are a lethal blend

479
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,080
of radioactive particles
and microwaves.

480
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,440
When that shield collapses,
microwave radiation

481
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,800
will literally

482
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,760
cook our planet.

483
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,360
Dr. Zimsky.

484
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,040
This is the Sun.

485
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,680
This is the Earth...
without the EM Field.

486
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,480
Would you?

487
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,760
Mm-hmm.

488
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,040
Three months, gentlemen,
and we're back in the Stone Age.

489
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,280
A full year,
the field collapses...

490
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,600
and that.

491
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,520
May I?

492
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,400
Feel free to throw up.
I know I did.

493
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,480
So, how do we fix it?

494
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,360
We can't.

495
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,400
Not in my vocabulary.

496
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,800
Then you might want
to get one of those

497
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,400
Word-A-Day calendars,
General, because

498
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,360
it's impossible.

499
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,440
The core is the size
of Mars.

500
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,160
You're talking about
jump-starting a planet.

501
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,000
This is a superheated
hyper-fluid

502
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,640
of molten iron and nickel
at 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit,

503
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,960
2,000 miles down,
1,000 miles thick.

504
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:25,240
And the deepest we've ever been
is... seven miles

505
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,800
with a two-inch drill bit.

506
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,120
If we can go into space,
we certainly...

507
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,080
Well, space is easy.

508
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:29,880
It's empty.

509
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,840
We're talking
about millions of pounds

510
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,280
of pressure
per square inch.

511
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,480
Even if we somehow
came up with a brilliant plan

512
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,320
to fix the core,
we just can't get there.

513
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,880
Yes, but...

514
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,720
...what if we could?

515
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,400
Hello, Braz.

516
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,440
Why the hell
aren't you dead yet?

517
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,040
Okay, this way.

518
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,960
Well, that went better
than I expected.

519
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,080
Dr. Brazzleton,

520
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,360
I see you know Dr. Zimsky.

521
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,440
Yeah.

522
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,760
20 years ago,
he stole my research.

523
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,720
After that,
we-we kind of lost touch.

524
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,400
Research that
was equally mine.

525
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,080
That's funny,
I don't remember a check

526
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,120
from any of the patents.

527
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,880
All right, Braz.

528
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,040
20 years in the desert makes
you a prophet and a martyr.

529
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,520
Look, we're here
about your legendary ship.

530
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,400
Okay, I'm combining
high-frequency pulse lasers

531
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,160
with resonance tube ultrasonics.

532
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,360
If you've ever seen
ultrasonic waves

533
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,280
break up a kidney stone
on the Discovery Channel,

534
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,400
it's the same deal here.

535
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,040
You can...
put your helmets on now.

536
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,360
Firing.

537
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,280
Woo-ooh!

538
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,600
Woo-hoo!

539
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,280
Yeah. Oh.

540
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,080
Okay, I'm officially impressed.

541
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,360
So, all right.

542
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,600
So you've made some progress

543
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,240
with the engine,
we'll grant you.

544
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,640
Have you begun to think
about a shell?

545
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,320
Okay, this is Alex.

546
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,720
Okay, Alex. Good.

547
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,760
Okay, here we have
a concrete block,

548
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,120
and in back of that,
we have a two-inch steel plate.

549
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,520
Okay. We're ready.

550
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,600
And we are... firing.

551
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,680
Voila!

552
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,120
That's...

553
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,720
That's impossible.

554
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,520
I combined the crystals

555
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,760
in a tungsten-titanium matrix
at supercool temperatures,

556
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,640
and that's what did the trick.

557
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,000
The applications
for this are just...

558
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,320
What do you call this material?

559
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,680
Well, its real name
has 37 syllables.

560
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,480
I call it Unobtainium.

561
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,040
Unobtainium?

562
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,400
Mm-hmm.

563
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,000
The Unobtainium will take
the heat and the pressure

564
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,440
and transform it to energy,

565
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,400
which in turn, reinforces
the shell of the ship, you see.

566
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,320
So the hotter
and the deeper she gets,

567
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,480
the stronger she gets...
theoretically.

568
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,960
Theoretically?

569
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,600
Theoretically, yes.

570
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,520
This... is Johnson,
don't mind him.

571
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,000
This is the prototype
for the cockpit here.

572
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,360
Excuse me,
Dr. Brazzleton,

573
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,240
when do you think
the ship will be operational?

574
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,680
When I get my fabrication
methods perfected...

575
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,720
12... ten years, ten years.

576
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,040
What would it take to get
it done in three months?

577
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,760
$15 billion. I...

578
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,080
Will you take a check?

579
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,640
Why don't you use a credit card?
You get miles.

580
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,760
Mm.

581
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,920
Shit!

582
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,120
Mr. Finch, this is the FBI.
We have a warrant.

583
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,800
Purge!

584
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,200
Come on, purge!

585
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,040
FBI! Freeze!

586
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,720
Okay.

587
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,240
I know these
look like computers.

588
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,600
Totally not.

589
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,560
Theodore Donald Finch.

590
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,840
Carnegie-Mellon University.
M.I.T.

591
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:27,200
Worked at the Sun,
Lucent, Rand Corp.

592
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,840
My handle's "Rat."
Call me Rat.

593
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,320
63 computer fraud indictments.

594
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,200
64.

595
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,200
Two convictions.

596
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,320
This is strike three, Mr. Finch.

597
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,320
Wait a second.

598
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,040
You guys aren't here
to whack me, are you?

599
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,360
Because I was really,
really hoping to have sex

600
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,440
before that happened.

601
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,920
Yeah. I've been told
by the FBI...

602
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,080
whose database you crippled
last year...

603
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,160
that you are
the best in the business.

604
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,240
So you're about
to be given a choice.

605
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,320
What if I say no?

606
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,560
Excuse me, but is this really

607
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,160
the best we could do?

608
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,360
I mean...

609
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,240
How many languages do you speak?

610
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,680
Five, actually.

611
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,480
Well, I speak one.

612
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,080
One, zero, one, zero, zero.

613
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,720
With that, I could steal
your money, your secrets,

614
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,080
your sexual fantasies,
your whole life,

615
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,360
any country, any place,
anytime I want.

616
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,800
We multitask
like you breathe.

617
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,800
I couldn't think
as slow as you if I tried.

618
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,920
Do you have any idea...?

619
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,920
Okay, hey. Hey!

620
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,160
Let's just, let's give
the kid a break.

621
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,280
Okay, it's a phone.

622
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,480
It's just a phone.

623
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:43,640
Rat, we got a big problem.

624
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,680
A lot of people
are going to die.

625
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,840
We need your help.

626
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,880
What kind of help?

627
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,320
Information control.

628
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,920
We need you to control the flow
of information on the Internet.

629
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,880
You're dreaming.
Nobody controls the 'Net.

630
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,080
Could you...
with unlimited resources?

631
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,520
You want me to hack the planet?

632
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,360
He wants me to hack the planet.

633
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,880
You've got free long distance

634
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,640
on that phone... forever.

635
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,400
Okay.

636
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,080
If I decide to do this...

637
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,320
I'm going to need
an unlimited supply

638
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,160
of Xena tapes and Hot Pockets.

639
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,120
Hot Pockets?

640
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,800
They help me concentrate.

641
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,120
Sounds fair.

642
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,360
Major Childs,
they're ready for you.

643
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,400
Major Childs,

644
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,800
a clarification:

645
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,240
You and you alone
were responsible

646
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,600
for proposing
the descent vectors

647
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,600
for the shuttle, correct?

648
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,920
Yes, General.

649
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,840
We have determined that
the Class "A" landing mishap

650
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,880
experienced by
the Shuttle <i>Endeavour</i>

651
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,320
was caused by biased
navigational data

652
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,120
from the ground due to a brief
geomagnetic disturbance.

653
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,520
Major Childs,
the resourcefulness you showed

654
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,760
in determining
the descent vectors proved

655
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,840
that you have exceptional
navigation skills.

656
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,920
You've brought much credit
upon yourself,

657
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,400
the space program
and the United States Air Force.

658
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,800
Congratulations, Major.

659
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,760
You are reassigned

660
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,200
with Commander Iverson
and Flight Director Stickley

661
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,680
to a new mission
effective immediately.

662
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,200
Transportation
is waiting outside.

663
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,240
Good luck and Godspeed, Major.

664
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,920
Are you sure you want
to wear this tie?

665
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,880
Why?

666
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,840
I don't know.

667
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,360
I mean, you look so
nervous about it.

668
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,440
You look so...

669
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,640
So, how are you holding up?

670
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,960
Oh, hi. I'm good, I'm good.

671
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,880
I'm about to tell
a couple hundred people

672
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,320
the world is going to end.

673
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,280
Well...

674
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,240
I've had better days.

675
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,160
You look good.

676
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,800
Well, no, you don't look good.

677
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,720
Why did he touch his tie
like that?

678
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,680
Thomas, let me speak
with you for a moment.

679
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,520
Listen, wouldn't you
rather I did this?

680
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,480
I mean, given my reputation,
I think that...

681
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,520
No. No, Keyes is in
the lead here, Zimsky.

682
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,480
Yes. Thomas, this is
the most important

683
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,040
scientific operation
in history.

684
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,760
And given my status, I feel that
it's my job to present...

685
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,400
Project Destiny
was your job, Zimsky.

686
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,440
And you went way beyond
authorized limits.

687
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,240
And let me tell...
And let me tell you,

688
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,520
I still, I want to know
if Destiny caused this problem.

689
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,880
It's highly unlikely,
but it may be the solution.

690
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,600
Now, I have not
finished checking...

691
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,160
Excuse me.

692
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:51,960
Rebecca...
I'm so glad I was wrong.

693
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,240
Right over left...

694
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,840
No, the other left,
the other left.

695
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,120
- Gentlemen.
- And then you...

696
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,360
Gentlemen.

697
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,360
Commander Iverson,
Major Childs,

698
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,640
this is your crew:

699
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,440
Dr. Brazzleton knows the ship;

700
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,560
Hello.

701
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,680
Dr. Zimsky knows the planet;

702
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,640
Doctor.

703
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,520
Dr. Leveque knows
the weapons system;

704
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,640
Excuse me, ladies first.

705
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,680
Hi.

706
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,480
And Dr. Keyes...

707
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,600
Dr. Keyes built
the navigation system, so...

708
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,720
Hi. Rebecca Childs.

709
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,000
Bob Iverson.

710
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,840
These are your fellow...
fellow... what?

711
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,840
Terranauts?

712
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,240
Hello.

713
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,360
All this brain power over here

714
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,320
is starting to smell
like burning batteries.

715
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,840
Y'all better come and join in.

716
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,920
Yeah.

717
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,480
It's the simplest things
that are the hardest, huh?

718
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,760
Yeah. It's official.

719
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,480
I'm the least-qualified person
on this base.

720
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,080
Dr. Keyes,
I'm sure the people in charge

721
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,320
have every confidence in you.

722
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,280
Well, the problem is that
I'm in charge.

723
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,040
Yeah, I know.

724
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,160
Can I help you?

725
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,880
Yes, please.

726
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,680
You're an astronaut,
and you can tie a Windsor?

727
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,720
Mm-hmm.

728
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,800
Is there anything you can't do?

729
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,800
Not that I'm aware of.

730
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,920
I find that
incredibly intimidating.

731
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,920
Yep. Most people do.

732
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,000
Here.

733
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,080
Thank you.

734
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,560
You're welcome.

735
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,520
Let me introduce our project
leader, Dr. Joshua Keyes.

736
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,120
Thank you, thank you.

737
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,680
Good evening. Good evening.

738
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,080
Wow. This looks like a meeting

739
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,760
for Nobel Prize Winners
Anonymous.

740
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,720
I know you are all
the finest in your fields

741
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,000
and have come a long way
to be here.

742
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:34,280
So, I'll outline our program
over the next three months.

743
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,480
Dr. Brazzleton will supervise
the building of a ship

744
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,280
which is capable of reaching
the center of our planet.

745
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,720
Once there, it will deliver
an explosive charge

746
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,680
large enough
to restart its core.

747
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,080
Dr. Zimsky will calculate

748
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,000
the scale
of the explosion needed.

749
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,800
This is a program I designed
to simulate the effect

750
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,360
of nuclear detonations
on the core.

751
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,960
If my calculations are correct,
a tiny nudge in any direction

752
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,960
will force the core back
into its normal flow.

753
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,760
What's a "tiny nudge"
in planetary terms?

754
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,160
A thousand megatons,
give or take?

755
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,680
Tops. Because any more than that

756
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,160
would create
a core instability.

757
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,960
We made a few monster warheads
in the 200-megaton range.

758
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,840
Braz, do you think the ship
can handle five of these babies?

759
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,440
Yeah. I can enlarge
the ejection pod...

760
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,480
Forgive me,

761
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,520
but, you know, I know
I'm not the expert here,

762
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,480
but what if the core
is thicker or thinner?

763
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,560
I mean, what if it's not
what you think it is?

764
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,120
Isn't that going to affect
the way the explosions are...?

765
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,600
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

766
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,600
And what if the core
is made of cheese?

767
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,320
This is all best
guess, Commander.

768
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,240
That's all science is,
is best guess.

769
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,240
So my best guess is
you don't know.

770
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,440
With luck, irony will break
for the good guys for once,

771
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,320
and the world's biggest weapons
of mass destruction

772
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,840
will help save the world.

773
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,320
The ship will be powered

774
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,760
by a small experimental
nuclear reactor.

775
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,960
It will be divided
into six compartments

776
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,320
like cars on a train:

777
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,440
The locomotive unit,
navigation compartment,

778
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,520
living quarters, engineering,
bomb compartment

779
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,920
and finally
the weapons-control module.

780
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,520
Up to a 45 degree angle, every
compartment will be held level

781
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,480
by these gyro control gimbals.

782
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,120
But if we do breach a section,

783
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,000
bulkhead doors engage
automatically,

784
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,240
seal off the section in red,
and eject.

785
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,560
Is ejection really
the best option?

786
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,760
Only option.

787
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,040
Each damaged compartment
degrades the entire hull.

788
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,400
The objective is simple.

789
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,360
The obstacles are gigantic.

790
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,120
We're going to need
all the help in the world,

791
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,920
but if we are to avoid
panic and chaos,

792
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
the world at large can never
know what's happening here.

793
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,200
Which is where our friend
Mr. Rat comes in.

794
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,160
It's called Virus-bot.

795
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,800
It's a computer virus
that will seek out files

796
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,920
anywhere on the Web that contain
keywords that we designate

797
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,960
and wipes them out.

798
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
This is my Kung-Fu,
and it is strong.

799
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,680
Meanwhile, there are
a million puzzles ahead of us,

800
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,240
and we have three months
to solve them.

801
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,000
We have a committed
and ingenious team.

802
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,080
We have every resource available
to us,

803
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,400
and we have the best

804
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,200
of the world's scientific and
technical talents on our side.

805
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,440
With your help we can,
we must... succeed.

806
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,800
Feedback in the resonance tube.

807
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,480
Talk to me, gentlemen.

808
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,440
We are losing

809
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,400
structural integrity.

810
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,520
No, it's not feedback.

811
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,160
It's an impeller malfunction,
I believe.

812
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,760
No, it's not, no. If it were
an impeller malfunction...

813
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,880
For God's sakes, Braz,
make the call!

814
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,720
No, I'll make the call.
I should make the call.

815
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,520
65 knots.

816
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,400
Depth, 8-5 thousand feet.

817
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,200
Look, guys...

818
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,320
It's a disaster!

819
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:41,120
What part of "talk to me"
don't you guys understand?

820
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,920
For the 22nd time in a row,

821
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,560
everyone on Earth is dead.

822
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,440
Let's take a little quiet time,

823
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,360
and you all are going
to try this again.

824
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,160
Hi.

825
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,480
Hi.

826
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,440
What is this?

827
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,920
Well, it's...
I invented it.

828
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,680
It's how you're going to...
going to steer underground.

829
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,160
It's, um...

830
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,880
not very good reception.

831
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,280
Well, you're looking

832
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,400
through three feet of lead
at 50 yards away, so...

833
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,680
it ain't bad.

834
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,040
It's like a CAT scan
at a hospital,

835
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,480
but it's-it's souped-up.

836
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,880
I invented it

837
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,000
for Deep Earth surveying.

838
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,400
And then the government came in,
bought my research,

839
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,960
paid off my student loan guys
and made me a consultant.

840
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,720
I'm sorry,
this is really delicate.

841
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,600
And I have it
just the way I want it.

842
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,480
So... excuse me.

843
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,840
Uh, yeah.

844
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,320
Then they brought me in
when the pacemakers quit,

845
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,400
and... boom...
you know, I'm Apocalypse Boy.

846
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,760
Apocalypse Boy?

847
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,360
Yeah. I'm having T-shirts
made up.

848
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,400
Well, hats sell better.

849
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,040
You know, it's funny,
because that is...

850
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,640
right where it should be.

851
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,600
Well...

852
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,480
I'm sorry. I'm a little
ragged around the edges.

853
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,560
I'm just trying to get
this thing to focus correctly.

854
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,080
This is really cool,
but can I just...?

855
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,040
Well... mm-hmm.

856
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,320
It's better.
It's better. Uh...

857
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,640
God, I hate this sky.

858
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,200
Crashing one ship
isn't enough for you?

859
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,880
Hey. Practice makes perfect.

860
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,440
You can practice all you like.

861
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,000
It doesn't mean you're ready
to sit in that seat.

862
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,720
So you keep reminding me, sir.

863
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,680
You know, I doubt

864
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,080
you're even going
to listen to this,

865
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,640
but I'm going to give it a shot.

866
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,640
Being a leader
isn't about ability.

867
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,520
It's about responsibility.

868
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,000
Got it, sir.

869
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,160
No, you don't, Beck.

870
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,720
I mean,
you're not just responsible

871
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,880
for making good decisions.

872
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,280
You have to be responsible
for the bad ones.

873
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,960
You got to be ready
to make the shitty call.

874
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:00,880
What makes you think
I'm not?

875
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,200
Because you're so good.

876
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,600
You haven't hit anything
you couldn't beat.

877
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,680
I mean, hell,

878
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,320
you were the one who figured out
how to save the shuttle.

879
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,360
You made me, you made the rest
of NASA just look like an ass.

880
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,360
It's just that
you're used to winning...

881
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,720
...and you're not really
a leader until you've lost.

882
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,200
$20 billion has been spent
developing this system...

883
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,240
Oh, come on, guys,
the chefs at NASA...

884
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,280
I want wine!
I need wine!

885
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,960
It's about nutrition.
In five days, I think...

886
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,160
Whoa!

887
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,120
That's high-level
static discharge.

888
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,920
I think we should
check this out.

889
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,520
This doesn't look so good.

890
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,800
It's a lightning superstorm.

891
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,520
Popping up all over the world.

892
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,840
Got 'em. Tracking.

893
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,880
Uh-oh. Rome does not look good.

894
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,720
This planet is decaying faster
than we thought.

895
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,000
It's just the start.

896
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,920
Soon they'll be EM spikes

897
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,120
and microwaves will break
through the weak spots and...

898
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,320
All right. Get this ship
in the ground. Now.

899
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,960
Ah! Summer in the Pacific.

900
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,680
Yeah, the world is inside out.

901
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,400
I was saving this for later,
but...

902
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,120
this is the time for...

903
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,000
Josh, do you mind?

904
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,160
No, not at all. Yeah.

905
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,760
We should have a name
for this baby.

906
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,760
Oh, she's called <i>Virgil,</i>
actually.

907
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,040
Virgil... the poet that led
our man into the depths of hell?

908
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,160
That's it.

909
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,280
That's appropriate, I guess.

910
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,400
Well, here's to <i>Virgil.</i>

911
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:22,080
To the planet.

912
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,080
- To <i>Virgil.</i>
- To <i>Virgil.</i>

913
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,960
No flashbulbs, no press,
nobody cheering.

914
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,320
It's... weird.

915
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,120
Let's go.

916
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:57,040
Cabin pressure, TSI, 3.5.

917
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,560
Check.

918
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,840
ECS cabin repress open.

919
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,560
And repress VLV closed.

920
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,920
Check.

921
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,120
Fluid dump valve.

922
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,760
We are about to begin
our journey

923
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,560
into the heart of the cosmos,

924
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,640
into the very core
of our own planet.

925
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:12,920
Close.

926
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,920
- Where we find therein...
- Check.

927
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,360
The secrets of the universe...

928
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,560
...3.5 PSI.

929
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,320
...the mysteries of time...

930
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,320
LM circuit lockup.

931
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,400
- Check.
...hope for the future.

932
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,360
And signal.

933
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,800
Deep Earth Control,
this is <i>Virgil.</i>

934
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,240
Signal check.

935
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,040
This is Deep Earth Control.

936
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,400
I have thumbs-up
across the board.

937
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,800
You are clear
to initiate power-up.

938
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,480
Reactor power confirmed.

939
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:49,600
At 1,000 rpm, we will countdown
to launch. On your mark.

940
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,400
Pad leader, stand by for launch.

941
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,760
All right, <i>Virgil.</i>

942
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,640
Mark.

943
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,680
Gantry count. Ten, nine,

944
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:05,480
eight, seven, six, five, four,

945
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,920
three, two, one...

946
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,960
launch.

947
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,880
500 feet.

948
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,680
Leveling out.

949
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,920
Okay, guys,
let's swing forward.

950
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,000
800 feet.

951
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,800
Light 'em up, Beck.

952
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,440
Gyro leveling operational.

953
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,200
Hull integrity holding.

954
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,480
I'm going to keep her nose
down about 15 degrees and...

955
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,400
Oh, my goodness.

956
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,840
They're singing to us.

957
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,480
<i>Virgil's</i> resonance tubes
are powered up,

958
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,920
so they're vibrating
sub sonically.

959
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,920
Actually, we're singing to them.

960
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,000
What's our depth?

961
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,560
1,600 feet,
plenty of room on both sides.

962
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,640
Hull integrity is good.

963
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,040
You sure?

964
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,040
Let's increase impeller speed.

965
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,800
I think we'll be needing
additional control.

966
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,960
Stick, I'm getting
a seismic reading.

967
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:47,960
What's happening?

968
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,920
T-phase.
Underwater earthquake.

969
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,480
Still think the water-launch
was a good idea?

970
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:01,400
Yes, yes, I chose this location
because the crust is thin here.

971
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,960
The downside is... there's lots
of seismic activity.

972
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,120
4,000 feet.

973
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,040
You see that rock?

974
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,280
That is not good.

975
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:18,760
We're losing steering here.

976
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,200
There's some kind
of crosscurrent.

977
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,280
14,000 feet.

978
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,080
Okay, guys, fasten
your seat belts.

979
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,840
We're turning into the skid.

980
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,000
18,000.

981
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,640
18,500.

982
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,160
They're going way too fast.

983
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,240
21,000 feet.

984
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,240
We hit the wall,

985
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,280
we're rabbits on the highway.

986
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,760
Pressure, pressure,
pressure, pressure.

987
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,040
What do you mean, pressure?

988
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,560
I thought you said this
thing was indestructible!

989
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:18,680
I said the pressure
makes us stronger.

990
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:19,800
We just don't have
enough of it yet.

991
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,480
We're at 25,000 feet.
Pull out, sir.

992
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,440
Can't.

993
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,840
- What?
- We're locked in.

994
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,440
Go to full throttle.

995
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:32,360
Standby to engage front
and lateral lasers, please.

996
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,600
But what if we hit bottom
in ten seconds here?

997
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,360
Just give it
a couple more seconds.

998
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,640
The lasers will fire.

999
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,880
No, there's not enough time
for power-up.

1000
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,600
27,000 feet.

1001
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,280
The lasers will deploy.

1002
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,200
29,000 feet.

1003
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,880
- Do it!
- And...

1004
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,720
Do it! Now.

1005
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,000
And we've got a signal.

1006
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,200
- All right.
- Yeah!

1007
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,000
All right.

1008
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,120
Switching on electron spin burst
transmitters.

1009
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,480
Plotting through
lowest density material,

1010
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,040
reconfiguring
every five minutes.

1011
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:04,560
Hull integrity 100%.
Reactor power 100%.

1012
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,640
All green
on the bomb compartment.

1013
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:07,400
Speed is 60 knots.

1014
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,560
Hot damn.

1015
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,120
All right, we'll be through
the crust in 15 minutes

1016
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,240
and into the mantle.

1017
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,320
24 hours to the core, and
then assuming we survive...

1018
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,560
Assuming?
Yes, assuming.

1019
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:20,720
Another 15 hours to the
inner core-outer core border.

1020
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,120
They're doing well.

1021
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,840
The crust is just rock.

1022
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,080
Now it gets interesting.

1023
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,560
<i>Virgil,</i> can we get
a status check?

1024
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,720
We're about to make
the transition into the mantle.

1025
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:00,960
Come on, come on.

1026
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,960
Well, exterior pressure
is 800,000 pounds

1027
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,440
per square inch.

1028
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,240
And hull integrity is 100%.

1029
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:24,880
It is as if we we're diving
through the memories

1030
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,000
of the planet.

1031
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,200
But we are about to pass
from memory

1032
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,080
into madness.

1033
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:33,800
Are you going to be doing
that Carl Sagan narration

1034
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:34,920
all the way to the core?

1035
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,360
- I beg your pardon?
- I said...

1036
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,520
I-I have an obligation to
my students, to my readers...

1037
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,080
An obligation to make
a book deal perhaps?

1038
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,640
Two book deals,
if you'd like to know the truth.

1039
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,240
I read that last book.
It wasn't very good.

1040
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,240
Oh, really? Really?

1041
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,560
When did you learn how to read?

1042
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,040
People.

1043
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,320
Drs. Zimsky and Keyes?

1044
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,240
You guys are
our resident geophysicists.

1045
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,680
What do you make of this?

1046
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,120
The mantle
is a chemical hodgepodge

1047
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,480
of... a variety of elements...

1048
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:25,840
Say it with me:
"I don't know."

1049
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,440
Well, Commander,

1050
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,000
wise men say, "When in doubt,
you should go around."

1051
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:30,680
No. It's too big.

1052
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,040
We turn too slow.

1053
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,600
Anything that
we can't go through

1054
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:35,680
displays as black.

1055
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,920
So what's... what's static?

1056
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,240
It's nothing.

1057
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,640
What do you mean?

1058
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,480
It's nothing.

1059
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:46,280
It's empty space.

1060
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,840
I...

1061
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,200
I never taught the computer
how to read empty space.

1062
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,480
And I never taught <i>Virgil</i>
how to fly.

1063
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:55,560
Oh, God!

1064
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,200
Oh, no, man!

1065
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,320
Oh, dear God.

1066
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,200
Serge, you all right?

1067
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,880
Yeah.

1068
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,760
Anybody hurt?

1069
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,960
No. You okay?

1070
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:37,920
Yeah.

1071
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,480
What's that?
What is that?

1072
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,000
From the cooling system.
Shut that down.

1073
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,880
Shut it down.

1074
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,760
I told you to go around her.

1075
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,240
Nobody listens to me.

1076
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,360
Where in God's name are we?

1077
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,280
Whatever has us jammed up
is inside our lasers.

1078
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:50,280
Shut 'em down.

1079
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,360
We're not going anywhere.

1080
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,120
Powering down.

1081
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:09,200
Josh, is there any other image
you can pull up?

1082
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,200
Nope.

1083
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:13,680
Whatever it is, it's also inside
our MRI cameras.

1084
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,440
We have to go outside.

1085
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:17,400
What?

1086
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:18,680
Believe me,
I hate to admit it,

1087
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:19,800
but I think he's right.

1088
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,320
I'm coming.
I want to collect samples.

1089
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,600
Wait, hang on, hang on.

1090
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,000
Wait, wait,
the first problem is,

1091
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,240
the only way out of the ship...
is the way we came in,

1092
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,720
which is through
the impeller outlet...

1093
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:28,800
Which is still
at 5,000 degrees.

1094
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,320
Exactly, I mean...

1095
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,640
I'll just flush it
with liquid nitrogen

1096
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:33,760
from the cooling system.

1097
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:34,960
Wait. The cooling system

1098
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,560
that's keeping us from
roasting to death in this ship?

1099
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:41,000
Well, just a small part of it.

1100
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:45,800
Alternatives?

1101
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,560
Anybody.

1102
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:03,840
Whoa, whoa, that's it.

1103
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,360
It's like a giant...
giant crystal.

1104
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,720
Where the hell are we?

1105
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,240
Well, the good news is,

1106
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,160
it looks like the suits
can take the pressure.

1107
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,000
It's completely jammed
the laser assembly.

1108
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,280
We just...
we got to hope,

1109
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,440
if we can cut it loose,

1110
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,600
- they're still functional.
- Careful!

1111
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,440
Okay.

1112
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:23,520
Got it.

1113
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,760
Beck, try the lights, will you?

1114
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,000
Lighting up.

1115
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,040
Oh, it's magnificent.

1116
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:34,480
Oh, my God.

1117
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,560
Aladdin's cave.

1118
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:40,000
It's like
a crystal Grand Canyon.

1119
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,560
I think it's a geode.

1120
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,000
But I don't understand

1121
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,480
how it could have survived
down here.

1122
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:01,840
Cobalt shell, maybe?

1123
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:02,960
No. I-I mean,

1124
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,360
in a magma environment
of 5,000 degrees.

1125
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,440
Something would have
to protect it.

1126
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,520
Unbelievable.

1127
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:09,480
Zimsky.

1128
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:10,760
Yeah?

1129
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:14,000
We're inside
a giant gem bubble,

1130
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:16,600
wrapped in a cobalt cocoon

1131
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:19,400
700 miles below the surface
of the Earth.

1132
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,400
Hell of a day.

1133
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,800
Yes, it is.

1134
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:26,880
I'll start cutting.

1135
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,080
Okay, Braz.

1136
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,040
I'm going to check the hull.

1137
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:30,160
Call me if you need me.

1138
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,680
Okay.

1139
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,280
Oh, no.

1140
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:42,120
- Zimsky!
- Yeah?

1141
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,320
Zimsky, look!

1142
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,880
It's an amethyst.

1143
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,480
Oh, God,

1144
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,400
we've breached the shell.

1145
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,320
Guys, you don't have to be here!

1146
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,920
I want you back inside!

1147
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,760
Well, I think that means me.

1148
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,240
Orders are orders.

1149
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,880
Wait, Josh.

1150
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,520
The problem is
I'm losing oxygen.

1151
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:23,280
Braz, what can I do?

1152
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,800
Check the feeds for me.

1153
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:28,120
Check the feeds for me, Josh.

1154
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:32,600
Quick!

1155
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:33,840
I'm coming. I'm coming
as fast as I can.

1156
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,000
Hey, guys, at this rate

1157
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:36,840
we have three minutes
before the lava gets to us.

1158
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:37,880
Come on, guys.

1159
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,160
Come on.

1160
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:46,440
It's not going to work
without oxygen!

1161
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,440
We're losing oxygen!

1162
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,280
I fixed it. Now cut!

1163
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,880
That's good. It's working now.

1164
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,200
It's working well now!

1165
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:02,920
That's good, Josh!

1166
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:14,760
Josh's vital signs are dropping.

1167
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,560
What?

1168
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,600
Serge!

1169
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,360
You're almost there.

1170
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:30,600
You're almost there, Josh.

1171
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,760
Josh!

1172
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,040
Joshua!

1173
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:02,200
Okay, guys,

1174
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,240
connect the oxygen.

1175
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,320
Braz, you got that?

1176
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,360
Yes. Connected!

1177
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,440
Good. I got to check
these lasers.

1178
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,920
Okay, Beck, turn 'em over.

1179
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:13,480
Pre-lasers only,
if you don't mind.

1180
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:14,640
Initiating.

1181
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,200
This better work.

1182
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,800
The tide's really coming in.

1183
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,440
Yes!

1184
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,560
We got lucky...
I think we're going

1185
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,920
to swim right out of this one.

1186
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:30,120
Bob?

1187
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,280
Huh?

1188
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,760
Bob?

1189
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:53,680
Bob...

1190
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:58,920
Braz, come on, it's over.

1191
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,120
Okay. Okay.

1192
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,200
Beck! Beck!

1193
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,800
We're coming in.

1194
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:08,200
Initiate start sequence.

1195
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,720
Beck!

1196
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,360
- Beck, do you hear me?
- Careful.

1197
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:14,320
Start the impellers!

1198
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,160
The door, open the door.

1199
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,800
Activate bulkhead doors!

1200
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:24,120
Now, Beck!

1201
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,680
You okay?
You're going to be weak.

1202
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:05,640
You're okay.

1203
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,200
Good job, good job.
Good man.

1204
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,440
Well done, well done.

1205
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:09,600
I'm fine. Thank you.

1206
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:10,560
So, um...

1207
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:13,920
we have some good news,
and, uh...

1208
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,200
and we have some bad news.

1209
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,640
Uh, good news.
I'll take good news.

1210
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:18,600
All right.

1211
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,960
Well, we're alive
and we're moving.

1212
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,160
That's g... that's good news.

1213
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:24,440
Oh, it is hot in here.

1214
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,280
Yeah, that nitro we flushed out

1215
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:29,000
of the cooling system,
it-it's causing things

1216
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:29,960
just to heat up a little.

1217
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:30,760
I'm going to go back

1218
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:31,880
and just make
some adjustments.

1219
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,440
I'll lend you a hand.

1220
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:34,800
All right.
I'm fine.

1221
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:37,160
I'm going to check
your heartbeat, okay?

1222
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,480
Thanks, Braz. Appreciate it.

1223
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,480
So, that's the bad news?

1224
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:43,440
That's not too bad.

1225
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,880
No.

1226
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,240
Commander Iverson died.

1227
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:49,200
But...

1228
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:51,800
we're living,
and he would want to...

1229
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:54,240
he'd want us to complete
our mission,

1230
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:57,400
so I think that it's important
that we all...

1231
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,600
It's all right.

1232
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,920
Thank you.

1233
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,120
I'm sorry.

1234
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:13,000
Let's give him a second, okay?

1235
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,000
He deserves that.

1236
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:22,440
Oh, God, this all just seems
too big, doesn't it?

1237
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:27,000
I think you were attempting
the impossible.

1238
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:29,120
You were trying
to save the world, and...

1239
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,600
it's overwhelming.

1240
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:35,040
I came here to save my wife
and my two children

1241
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:39,200
and... six billion lives...
it's too much.

1242
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,160
I just hope
I'm-I'm smart enough

1243
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,160
and brave enough to save three.

1244
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,680
You did a nice job, Joshua.
Very nice. Great.

1245
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,400
You'd have done the same thing.

1246
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:50,480
Well, maybe, maybe.

1247
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,080
Hey... who's steering
the ship?

1248
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:06,640
Video screen autopilot.

1249
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,160
I hope he knows the way.

1250
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:12,120
You and me both.

1251
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,640
So... you're really
a college professor?

1252
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:17,840
You're not from the CIA,

1253
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:21,720
or the NSA or any
of those three-letter places?

1254
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:24,360
No. I am a boring
college professor.

1255
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:29,240
Wrong place, wrong place.

1256
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:32,920
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.

1257
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,360
Well, I just, I just...

1258
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:35,800
Listen, the lack of oxygen

1259
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,200
kept me from weeping
like a little girl

1260
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:41,720
as is my custom
in dangerous situations.

1261
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:53,360
Hey, guys, we're close
to the mantle core interface.

1262
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:54,440
Where are you?

1263
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:57,120
Key's in, Dr. Brazzleton.

1264
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:59,400
Ready.

1265
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,520
We are in the...

1266
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,040
Okay, the code...
0-1-3-1-9-9-5.

1267
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,720
...luxurious, beautiful
weapons control...

1268
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:05,640
checking the controls
on the nukes.

1269
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:08,000
This is the birthday
of my daughter.

1270
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:09,520
0-1-3-1-9-9-5.

1271
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:10,920
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1272
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,160
Three, two and one...

1273
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,360
Thank you.

1274
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:17,480
Green. All green.

1275
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:19,520
Great. So we have
to synchronize

1276
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:20,880
the babies now.

1277
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,080
Just a second.

1278
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:28,760
There.

1279
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,960
All right,
now let's put them to bed.

1280
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:35,240
Zimsky, could you please
come up here for a second?

1281
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:36,520
Yes?

1282
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,920
We're not supposed to go through
anything black.

1283
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,080
Yes, so please don't.

1284
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:41,120
What is this?

1285
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,120
They're scattered everywhere.

1286
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:50,200
Oh, my God!
They're diamonds!

1287
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,520
Great.

1288
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,600
You might want to sit down
and buckle up.

1289
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,360
We're on a collision course
here.

1290
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,560
All rightie. Careful.

1291
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:10,760
Guys, we're dodging diamonds
the size of Cape Cod,

1292
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,440
so bear with me.

1293
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:14,240
Not exactly nimble here.

1294
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:15,680
Diamonds? I want some.

1295
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:16,680
Can I help?

1296
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:39,240
Ooh!

1297
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:44,160
Okay.
It's okay.

1298
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,520
Okay, it looks like
we're in the clear.

1299
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,560
Breach!

1300
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:59,160
Guys! Weapons control, get out!

1301
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:00,320
Get out now!

1302
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,160
Serge!

1303
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:15,520
Serge! What the hell
are you doing?

1304
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:18,120
Come on!

1305
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,600
My notebook!

1306
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:20,720
Now!

1307
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:24,640
Serge!

1308
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:33,480
Take the time reg, Joshua!

1309
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:35,040
Come on Serge! Come on!

1310
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,880
My notes!
You'll need them!

1311
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:37,840
No!

1312
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:40,040
God, no, Serge!

1313
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:41,320
It's okay.

1314
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,160
Serge, come on! No!

1315
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:44,120
Serge!

1316
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,360
Come on, man!

1317
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:49,120
- Leave the box!
- We need the box!

1318
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:50,840
We can get him!
We can get him out!

1319
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:54,880
Hold on, Serge!

1320
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:08,000
Beck! Beck!

1321
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:10,560
Override the ejection system!

1322
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,480
Beck, no!
One damaged compartment

1323
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:14,680
threatens the whole ship!

1324
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:17,800
Beck! Beck!

1325
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:21,680
Override the ejection system!

1326
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,160
Serge, we're right here.

1327
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,840
We're not going
to forget about you, man.

1328
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,200
- Josh, can you hear me?
- Serge! Serge...

1329
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:32,680
Hey, buddy,
look in your monitor right now.

1330
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:33,680
Serge, look in your monitor.

1331
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,520
I'm right here. Serge...

1332
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,520
Josh, I can't see you.

1333
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,920
Braz is going to override
the doors manually, okay?

1334
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,080
We're working on it right now.
Braz, how long?

1335
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,640
Going as fast as I can,
Fast as I can.

1336
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,760
- Okay, I'm scared.
- We're going right now.

1337
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,120
Shouldn't be two seconds,
all right?

1338
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,120
Josh!

1339
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,840
Beck, override
the ejection systems, okay?

1340
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:55,360
Damn. I don't think
Beck can hear me.

1341
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,360
Serge, look at me now. Serge!

1342
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,040
Serge, we're right here, okay?

1343
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,680
We're not going
to forget about you, man.

1344
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:02,080
I'm going to get you
out of here.

1345
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:03,400
We're working on it, all right?

1346
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:06,320
Stay with me here.
Okay?

1347
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,800
I don't know what to do.

1348
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:09,160
Can you hear me now?
All right, here I am.

1349
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,240
I'm not going
to let you go, man.

1350
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:12,680
I'm not going to let you go,
all right?

1351
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:15,920
Stay with me here, okay?

1352
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,200
I'm going to come to Paris

1353
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,200
and we'll go out, all right?
After this.

1354
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,760
After this is all
said and done, all right?

1355
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,560
- Josh!
- Serge!

1356
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,760
Serge! Serge!

1357
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:28,200
Serge!

1358
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:30,280
Serge!

1359
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,920
Did you reset the overrides?

1360
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,880
I never pushed them.

1361
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:30,280
You let him die.

1362
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,120
Actually,
you really want to know?

1363
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:35,600
I killed him twice.

1364
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:36,640
First when I hit the diamond,

1365
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,120
and then when I didn't hit
the override.

1366
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:40,560
Do you want me to feel any worse
about that than I already do?

1367
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:41,600
It's not possible.

1368
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:42,920
Why are you being
so smug about that?

1369
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,360
Could you have made
the decision?

1370
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,320
- Yes.
- Could you?

1371
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,360
Yes, I could've.

1372
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:47,720
If you would've hit
that switch,

1373
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,120
I could've got him outta there!

1374
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,160
I was yelling for you!

1375
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:55,840
Take it and look at it!

1376
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:58,400
I was two inches from him!

1377
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,000
I was two inches,

1378
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,560
and I told you
to put the door up

1379
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:02,520
and you didn't!

1380
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:03,880
I was screaming for you!

1381
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:06,320
Why didn't you do it?!

1382
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:09,240
Because I had to make
that decision.

1383
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:10,920
Fate or God...

1384
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:11,920
No!

1385
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,760
Damn it!
You leave God out of this!

1386
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:16,000
Serge died so that we could
complete our job.

1387
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:17,480
Oh, that's right,
the job of saving the world.

1388
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:21,800
Not the whole world, Josh!
Just three of them.

1389
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:13,080
<i>Virgil,</i> you are approaching
core interface.

1390
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:14,280
Are you good to go?

1391
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:15,520
Josh?

1392
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:17,720
Josh, can you hear me?

1393
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,160
Josh, can you hear me?

1394
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:29,000
Ready as we'll ever be, Stick.

1395
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:31,640
Dr. Keyes.

1396
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:33,560
Right here.

1397
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:39,360
Deep Earth,
we are green and good to go.

1398
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,080
We just got a huge speed jump.

1399
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:18,960
We just got a huge speed jump.

1400
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,000
We're at 95 knots.

1401
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,120
110.

1402
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:23,680
130... 140.

1403
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:27,240
Our speed's jumped
because the density of the core

1404
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:28,720
is different than our estimates.

1405
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,440
It's lighter
than we thought.

1406
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:31,480
So much for best guesses.

1407
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:32,480
I'm fine with this.

1408
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:33,480
At this rate, we'll, what...

1409
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:35,320
hit the inner core
in a little over five hours.

1410
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:36,680
I think we finally

1411
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:37,640
bought some luck.

1412
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:38,600
Braz.

1413
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:39,600
- Yeah.
- Would you please

1414
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:42,280
punch the new core density
into the equations

1415
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:43,360
for the nuclear detonation?

1416
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:49,960
Please tell me this is enough.

1417
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:56,040
Okay.

1418
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:57,560
You're telling me

1419
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:59,400
the 1,000 megatons
of nuclear warheads

1420
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:01,240
we hauled down here
isn't going to cut it?

1421
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:04,640
No. This core material
is too thin.

1422
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:06,120
- What?
- The energy waves from

1423
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:07,200
the explosion
won't spread far enough.

1424
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:08,640
They'll just bleed
away into nothing.

1425
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:15,240
That's it.

1426
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:17,640
We go home.
We go home.

1427
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:19,560
- Home?
- What?

1428
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,160
Our Commander is dead.

1429
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:22,720
Our weapons specialist is dead.

1430
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:24,520
Our weapons control systems
are gone.

1431
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:27,080
We don't know whether
we can arm the nuclear devices,

1432
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:29,600
and our plan to fix the core
no longer works. So...

1433
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:30,600
we have failed.

1434
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:31,760
We have not failed.

1435
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,880
We have failed, and we go home,

1436
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:36,320
and we go to the alternative.

1437
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,160
What alternative?

1438
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,600
What are you talking about?

1439
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:40,560
General,
this is Dr. Conrad Zimsky.

1440
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:41,520
Destiny is a go.

1441
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,480
Repeat.

1442
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,280
Destiny is a go.

1443
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:45,440
Damn.

1444
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:52,880
I need to know everything
to do my job.

1445
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:55,160
You don't have to know this.

1446
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:56,640
General, it is my job

1447
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:59,320
to ensure the safety
of this mission.

1448
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,640
Anything that affects
it is my business.

1449
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:03,400
Now what the hell is Destiny?

1450
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:05,320
It's a device.

1451
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:10,720
Deep Earth Seismic Trigger
Initiative, DEST-INI. Destiny.

1452
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,520
We had reason to believe

1453
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,720
that our enemies were
building a weapon

1454
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:17,200
that could generate
targeted seismic events.

1455
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,720
They would be able
to create massive earthquakes

1456
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,680
under our territory.

1457
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,000
No way of telling who did it.

1458
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:24,160
So?

1459
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:25,960
So... we built one, too.

1460
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:27,800
M.A.D.

1461
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:29,360
Mutually Assured Destruction.

1462
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,480
A perfect acronym
if ever there was one.

1463
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,080
Beautiful.

1464
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:34,040
They built it first.

1465
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:35,000
I built it better.

1466
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:36,360
I beamed high-powered

1467
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,040
electromagnetic
energy waves down Deep Earth

1468
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,520
fault lines, and, you know.

1469
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:41,280
Zimsky, what makes you think

1470
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:43,560
that Destiny
would even touch the core?

1471
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,120
'Cause it already did.

1472
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:49,680
This isn't a fluke.

1473
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:50,720
We killed the planet.

1474
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,520
You keep saying
that the core is too big

1475
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,440
to be affected by anything
short of nukes.

1476
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:55,520
- So...
- The core is an engine.

1477
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,240
Throw a small wrench
into a big engine,

1478
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:58,320
you can still stall it.

1479
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:02,880
Deep Earth, this is <i>Virgil.</i>

1480
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:07,360
We require clarification on
the status of Project Destiny.

1481
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:08,960
Why weren't
we notified of this, sir?

1482
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,920
Because you didn't need to know,
Major.

1483
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:13,640
Now you may not like this.

1484
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:14,920
I may not like it either.

1485
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
But it's my job,
and I do it for my country,

1486
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:19,840
and if we don't develop these
devices, someone worse will

1487
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:21,480
and they will
use them against us.

1488
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:23,080
But you have my word.

1489
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,960
No one in this
administration... no one,

1490
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:28,360
had any idea
that this could happen.

1491
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:30,920
So the device that killed the
planet is your backup plan?

1492
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,440
An electric shock
can stop a heart.

1493
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,600
It can certainly restart one.

1494
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:37,000
Destiny will work.

1495
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,280
It has to.

1496
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:39,240
No, it won't work.

1497
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:40,400
If you fire that thing again

1498
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:43,120
with the core already stalled,
it'll terminally destabilize it.

1499
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:45,160
Yes, granted... there is
a marginal risk involved,

1500
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:46,400
but given the circumstances,

1501
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,920
I hardly see that there's
an alternative.

1502
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:48,880
No, Zimsky, listen to me.

1503
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,400
Every volcano
on the planet will blow.

1504
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:52,960
There'll be earthquakes big
enough to rip us to pieces.

1505
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:53,920
- Dr. Keyes.
- What?

1506
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,680
I'm afraid it's all we've got.

1507
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:57,880
Now, I have orders
from the president.

1508
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:58,960
Come home, <i>Virgil.</i>

1509
01:23:59,040 --> 01:23:59,920
We go to plan B.

1510
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:00,960
Well, what about plan C?

1511
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:02,560
What? What?

1512
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:03,680
Well, plan C.

1513
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,200
We continue on.

1514
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,240
We restart the core...
somehow.

1515
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:09,840
We don't do it,
you fire Destiny.

1516
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,240
I can't wait for you
to get out of there.

1517
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:13,080
Then don't.
We fail, fire Destiny.

1518
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:14,400
Oh, come on! That's ridiculous!

1519
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:15,080
What choice do we have,

1520
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:16,160
- Zimsky?
- Are you kidding me?

1521
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:17,320
If they set that thing off,

1522
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:18,720
the shock waves
will wipe us out!

1523
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,920
We'll be lucky to get back
if we turn back right now!

1524
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,840
<i>Virgil,</i> I'm telling you
right now, we will fire Destiny,

1525
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:25,880
and we need to do so
as quickly as possible,

1526
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:27,320
and if you're still there,

1527
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:29,320
you will be destroyed.

1528
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,080
Rebecca?

1529
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,280
Please don't make me
have to do this.

1530
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:39,960
Plan C.

1531
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:44,880
It's your call, Commander.

1532
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:52,840
Majority decision.

1533
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:55,400
We're going in.

1534
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:56,680
I'm sorry, sir.

1535
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:02,120
Oh, come on, you're
a bunch of suicidal morons!

1536
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:03,280
What are you, crazy?

1537
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,280
Plan C?
Restart the core "somehow"?

1538
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:06,280
Oh, that's a great idea!

1539
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:07,320
That's a brilliant idea!

1540
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:08,480
I can't believe I'm stuck

1541
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,480
in this floating septic tank
with you lunatics!

1542
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:11,920
You may have nothing to lose.

1543
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:12,880
You may have nothing to lose!

1544
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:13,840
You may have nothing to lose

1545
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:14,800
but I have my life to lose,

1546
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,000
thank you very much
while you're up!

1547
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,000
Now turn it around!

1548
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,560
He told us to go back
and we're going back!

1549
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:20,520
Why? You want to be a hero?
You want to be a martyr?

1550
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:22,360
What do you want to be?
You're out of your mind!

1551
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:24,080
Thank you!
Turn it around!

1552
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:25,200
- No!
- Zimsky.

1553
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:31,760
You, shut up!

1554
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,840
It's not a stupid ship.

1555
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:41,880
I had to.

1556
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:46,440
It had to happen sometime.

1557
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,400
Yeah.

1558
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,520
Oh...

1559
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:56,560
Status! What is that?

1560
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:58,280
It's the EM
monitoring station.

1561
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,240
It's the one that

1562
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,320
tracks EM pulses.

1563
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:01,760
God, no.

1564
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:06,800
Just talk, Mr. Rat.

1565
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:07,760
No.

1566
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,280
That's a good boy.

1567
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:11,840
Remember those
invisible microwaves

1568
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,920
that Josh was talking about?

1569
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:16,080
Well, they just found a hole.

1570
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:56,840
No, it's a parking lot
out here...

1571
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:12,040
Oh, my God.

1572
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:45,640
And now with this

1573
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:47,080
horrific breaking news,

1574
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:50,640
we go live to San Francisco,
where Leo Jacks has the story.

1575
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:52,680
Yes, Claire,
it's hard to believe

1576
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:55,080
that half of San Francisco
is in ruins today

1577
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:57,320
following the most devastating
and the most baffling

1578
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:00,800
event in our nation's history.

1579
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:02,680
It's-it's
a horrific situation here.

1580
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:03,760
Thousands are dead.

1581
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,880
Many are missing.

1582
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:06,760
It's-it's hotels, hospitals.

1583
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,000
Bring up the power grid.

1584
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:13,080
The whole West Coast is out.

1585
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:17,240
That means we're going to have
to suck up just about every drop

1586
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:18,600
of juice east of the Rockies

1587
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:19,880
to fire Destiny.

1588
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:23,560
Another EM spike, we're not
going to have enough power.

1589
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:27,200
General, you have got
to give them more time.

1590
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:28,480
There is no more time.

1591
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:29,760
Colonel, call Destiny.

1592
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:31,200
I am launching
a formal complaint

1593
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:33,640
against you
with the Department of Defense.

1594
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:34,600
Rat to Josh.

1595
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:35,720
Go, Rat.

1596
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:36,840
Hey, um...

1597
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:39,840
here's the EM Field data
that you're primed for.

1598
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:42,240
Digging that, Rat.

1599
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:43,360
Primed for.

1600
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:44,520
Primed for.

1601
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:47,280
Prime numbers...

1602
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,480
one, two, three, five,

1603
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:51,520
seven, 11, 13, 17...

1604
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,040
Here we go.

1605
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:39,680
James.

1606
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:47,680
Yes, sir.

1607
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:50,840
Yes, sir.

1608
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:52,840
Here we go, folks.

1609
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:55,120
Okay, this time
it's going to work.

1610
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,480
Here you go... beautiful.
Yeah, mm-hmm.

1611
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:58,440
Come on, baby.

1612
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:01,320
Come on, Daddy wants to see
the sky again.

1613
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:05,600
Okay, okay, okay.
Let's try again.

1614
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:06,840
Your torque is R,

1615
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:08,320
cross F...

1616
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:10,560
No, your R is too small, Josh.

1617
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:11,560
Right.

1618
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:12,520
Wait, hold on.

1619
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:13,800
What are you laughing at?

1620
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:17,000
No, I mean, it took me and 400
of the world's smartest people

1621
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:18,680
to come up with the first plan.

1622
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:19,800
You want to help?

1623
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:21,920
No. I want to turn around
and go home.

1624
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,400
It's not going to happen.

1625
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:25,120
Well, then we're going to die.

1626
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:27,240
True.

1627
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:28,320
All right, look,

1628
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:29,400
- let's start from square one.
- Okay.

1629
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:30,360
Let's start from square one.

1630
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:33,320
The bulk modules...
depends on density.

1631
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:35,240
Your torque is R cross F,

1632
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:37,960
but you have
to integrate volume...

1633
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:41,800
But here, here...
just consider this.

1634
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:46,600
Now, we got this...

1635
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:48,120
Okay, now, R cross F,

1636
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:50,520
we're putting in pi.
What's V?

1637
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:53,120
Oh, for God's sake!

1638
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:54,480
All right.
I'm hitting him again.

1639
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:55,480
No, no, no!

1640
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:57,800
Braz, no, look, I have a theory.

1641
01:30:58,760 --> 01:30:59,560
Are you interested?

1642
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:00,920
Yes. We're interested.

1643
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,720
Then let me smoke a cigarette,
and I'll tell you.

1644
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:13,760
Oh, thank God.

1645
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,720
Hmm? All right, fine, look.

1646
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:19,160
Look, we have to use
wave interference, okay?

1647
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:21,000
Because one explosion
won't do it.

1648
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:22,560
Think about stones in a pond.

1649
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:24,480
You drop a large stone
into a pond,

1650
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:25,640
you get a big splash,

1651
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:27,280
and then that's it, it's over.

1652
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:30,920
But drop a smaller stone,
wait until the ripples weaken

1653
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,640
and drop another and another,
and another,

1654
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:36,040
and fluid dynamics 101.

1655
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:38,560
The ripples reinforce each other
in geometric progression.

1656
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:41,080
Hm, the whole bigger than
the sum of the parts.

1657
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:42,240
Then we'll have five

1658
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,520
200 megaton explosions...

1659
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:46,080
Instead of one big bang.

1660
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:48,040
So, we hot-wire the nukes.

1661
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:49,000
Yes.

1662
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:49,960
And as one does,

1663
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:51,800
we seed them
through the core...

1664
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:54,720
at locations that have
to be accurate to the inch.

1665
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:57,680
We detonate them in a sequence
that has to be accurate

1666
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:58,920
to the millisecond...

1667
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:03,080
then we outrun the biggest
nuclear shock wave in history.

1668
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:04,120
Right.

1669
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:05,960
Yeah.

1670
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:09,800
I mean, that should be
fairly simple.

1671
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:19,400
Destiny now should be
diverting to the central.

1672
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:20,480
Final calibration

1673
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:22,560
on both transmission systems...

1674
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:29,360
Come on.

1675
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:30,560
Cut the...
cut the rouge.

1676
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:33,120
The red wire above the circuit.

1677
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:34,120
Okay. Okay.

1678
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:35,120
No, no, wait, hold it!

1679
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:36,320
I'm sorry, cut it below.

1680
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:42,200
Please...

1681
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:47,960
Extensions A, B.

1682
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:48,960
- Here we go.
- F, check.

1683
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:51,080
Increase power to reactors
ten through 15

1684
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:53,120
We're almost there, folks.

1685
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:45,440
Okay, guys we're closing
on the inner core.

1686
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:47,680
The nukes are ready.
Timers are on.

1687
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:50,440
Great.
Let's start dropping them.

1688
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:52,920
No. The bombs are not built
for these pressures.

1689
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,600
That's why they were
in that pod.

1690
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:55,880
If you send them out now...

1691
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:57,720
out of that casing,
they'll be crushed instantly.

1692
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:58,760
I'm assuming we have a Plan D.

1693
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:00,200
Plan D is
<i>Virgil's</i> compartments.

1694
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:01,160
We put a nuke in

1695
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:02,240
each section of <i>Virgil,</i>

1696
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:04,240
and then eject the individual
sections one at a time.

1697
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:06,520
They should stay intact long
enough for the nuke to go off.

1698
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:07,640
Oh...

1699
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:09,960
What?

1700
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:13,800
<i>Virgil's</i> not designed to eject
undamaged compartments.

1701
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:16,040
Okay, these are
the ejection mechanisms

1702
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:17,960
holding each compartment
in place.

1703
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:21,000
They're all connected
by one master hydraulic gear.

1704
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:23,760
Kind of like keys
on a key ring.

1705
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:26,520
What we have to do, we have
to unlock the piston.

1706
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:28,480
That will release
the compartments

1707
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:30,040
so the bombs can be jettisoned.

1708
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:31,360
Where's the master gear?

1709
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:34,120
In the crawl space
we used to get out earlier.

1710
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:35,360
Well, what the hell
is it doing there?

1711
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:36,800
I built the ship
in three damn months.

1712
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:37,880
I didn't think I'd be

1713
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:39,520
intentionally sabotaging it.
I'm sorry!

1714
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:40,760
So one of us has to go in there.

1715
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:42,240
Correct.

1716
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:44,200
Into the crawl space that has
core fluid at 9,000 degrees.

1717
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:45,160
Yes.

1718
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:46,640
Can you flush it
with liquid nitrogen?

1719
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:48,160
We don't have enough
at this point.

1720
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:49,280
9,000 degrees.

1721
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:51,240
And our suits are built
to withstand...?

1722
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:52,800
Half that, probably.

1723
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:53,800
Right. Half that.

1724
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:55,200
So what you're saying is

1725
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:57,320
whoever goes into that crawl
space, is not coming back.

1726
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:01,200
Hmm.

1727
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:08,280
Together.

1728
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:09,560
Yes, thank you.

1729
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:11,040
Wait.

1730
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:12,840
- On three.
- Okay.

1731
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:15,360
One... two... three.

1732
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:26,440
Huh.

1733
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:31,800
Well, I better go on,
get myself ready.

1734
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:32,920
No, Braz, wait.

1735
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,440
No, Braz, no wait.
Excuse me.

1736
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:36,000
Just a moment, may I see that?

1737
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:37,000
- No.
- May I?

1738
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:37,960
May I?

1739
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:39,160
Yes.

1740
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:41,000
Thank you.

1741
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:43,520
Magic.

1742
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:47,520
I mean, Braz, three straws
of equal length.

1743
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,160
I mean, this is childish.

1744
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:50,400
Let's do it again.

1745
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:52,280
No, we will not do it again.

1746
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:53,960
I thought you'd be happy.

1747
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:54,920
No. Not at the expense

1748
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,360
of you making us
look like fools.

1749
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,560
He's right. Why do you get dibs
on being the hero?

1750
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:00,000
Because it's my damn ship.

1751
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:01,480
Oh, that makes perfect sense.

1752
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:04,960
Look, for 20 years, I've done
nothing but <i>Virgil.</i> 20 years.

1753
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:06,320
<i>Virgil</i> belongs to me,

1754
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,040
and I will not let her fail.

1755
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:09,320
I will not.

1756
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:11,480
Now if you want to know
what's worth dying for...

1757
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:12,440
this ship.

1758
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:15,360
Building it
instead of imagining it.

1759
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:19,520
If <i>Virgil</i> needs more blood,
it will be my blood.

1760
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:21,600
Now I am going to go

1761
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:22,920
and get ready.

1762
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:35,520
Good to go.

1763
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:41,600
Beck.

1764
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:43,160
Josh.

1765
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:48,640
It's a hell of a boat
you built, Braz.

1766
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:52,840
I am really proud to
have known you guys.

1767
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:54,840
Thank you.

1768
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:16,040
Braz.

1769
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:18,120
Edward.

1770
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:21,920
Yes, Conrad?

1771
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:23,440
You're right.

1772
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:25,200
It is your ship.

1773
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:29,000
But I wish to God
it had been ours.

1774
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:54,120
The chamber's sealed, Beck.

1775
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:56,040
Ready.

1776
01:37:57,640 --> 01:38:00,480
Open the hatch.

1777
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:39,240
Hang on, Braz.

1778
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:41,240
Come on, hang on.

1779
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:34,400
Manual override is complete!

1780
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:35,880
Braz, we can still
get you out of there.

1781
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:43,000
No... start...
start the impeller.

1782
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:47,280
No.

1783
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:15,840
We got a job to do.

1784
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:17,000
Let's do it.

1785
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:18,960
Let's go.

1786
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:21,360
Magnetic shielding systems
are up.

1787
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:23,400
Magnetic shielding systems
are up.

1788
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:24,560
Power level's 85%.

1789
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:26,440
Increase power to Reactor 10.

1790
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:28,480
All personnel should be clear.

1791
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:45,200
Oh, God!

1792
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:46,240
Oh, I'm sorry.

1793
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:52,160
Okay, she's down.

1794
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:54,920
Approaching the first
drop-off point.

1795
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:56,680
We got to be accurate
to the second here, boys.

1796
01:40:58,680 --> 01:41:01,120
And drop in three-five seconds.

1797
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:04,160
And... timer on.

1798
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:05,680
Pull it.

1799
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:11,680
Clear... and...

1800
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:13,280
ejecting.

1801
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:22,480
All right.
Initiate firing sequence.

1802
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:23,800
Sir...

1803
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:26,240
It's our last shot, Stick.

1804
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:27,400
Damn you.

1805
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:29,800
Damn me? Too late.

1806
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:33,160
Ten, nine, eight...

1807
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:36,520
What's that?

1808
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:41,800
Gotcha!

1809
01:41:41,880 --> 01:41:43,640
...four, three, two...

1810
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:45,040
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1811
01:41:45,120 --> 01:41:47,520
Someone's diverted our energy.

1812
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:49,760
Where the hell's it gone?!

1813
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:52,400
It looks like...

1814
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:54,040
Coney Island.

1815
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:59,400
Your Kung Fu is not strong.

1816
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:02,120
Well, how long will it take
to get it back online?

1817
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:03,840
Well, then get to it!

1818
01:42:11,480 --> 01:42:12,480
Oh, hey, General.

1819
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:14,800
Is there something
I can do for you?

1820
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:21,320
Timer on.

1821
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:23,160
Clear...

1822
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:24,160
ejecting.

1823
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:32,360
Ejecting.

1824
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:37,720
Pull it.

1825
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:38,920
All right.

1826
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:41,560
Let's go throw our last little
200 megaton stone in the pond.

1827
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:43,720
I always wanted to make a splash
in nuclear physics.

1828
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:45,360
You know, that energy
propagation stuff

1829
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:46,520
you were talking about...

1830
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:47,880
Oh, that was
high school physics.

1831
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:49,000
Yeah, it's not exactly...

1832
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:50,920
I just took the wavelengths
from the core fluid

1833
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,040
off the MRI readings.

1834
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:53,480
Yeah, and multiplied by 800...

1835
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:54,760
600.

1836
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:57,760
Surely you compensated
for the MRI bias.

1837
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:59,120
We got to reset the timers!

1838
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:02,720
Reset the timers!
No! It just won't work.

1839
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:04,520
It's not the timers!
This is not enough!

1840
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:05,480
What's not enough?

1841
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:06,680
The last bomb is
not enough.

1842
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:07,880
To complete the wave form.

1843
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:10,000
Yeah. No. The last bomb
has to be 30%larger.

1844
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,520
That's six or seven pounds
of plutonium.

1845
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:13,800
Where are we going to get six
or seven pounds of plutonium?

1846
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:22,560
Guys, we got hit

1847
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:23,520
by an energy flare.

1848
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:24,880
I can't keep us on course.

1849
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:26,720
Ejecting compartment
in 50 seconds.

1850
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:28,200
No, Beck! No, wait!
No! Push it!

1851
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:30,240
You push it!

1852
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:31,880
Come on, guys, I can't hear you.

1853
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:35,600
It's got my shoulder!

1854
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:36,560
Push!

1855
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:37,520
Guys!

1856
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:38,560
Clear!

1857
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:40,200
Clear the compartment!
What are you doing?

1858
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:41,800
I think the flare
has knocked the Coms out.

1859
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:43,200
I can't get it, Josh.
I can't get it.

1860
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:44,520
Go...

1861
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:46,160
I can't.

1862
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:47,160
Okay.

1863
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:49,760
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1864
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:51,720
Can you hear me?

1865
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:53,760
I'm correcting course. Now!

1866
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:00,520
Zimsky!

1867
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:03,280
No!

1868
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:08,800
Push it!

1869
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:12,480
Ejecting compartment
in ten seconds.

1870
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:13,920
Can you hear me?

1871
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,840
Josh, go! Go! Go!

1872
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:17,480
Get out! Get out!

1873
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:20,960
Now! Get out!
Now! Get out! Go!

1874
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:34,240
Josh.

1875
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:37,200
For the last bomb,
to make it larger...

1876
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:39,920
use the fuel rods
from the react...

1877
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,160
Ejecting.

1878
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:50,320
I got to get...

1879
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:52,440
I got to...

1880
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:55,400
Beck.

1881
01:44:55,480 --> 01:44:56,560
Beck, can you hear me?

1882
01:44:56,640 --> 01:44:59,280
Beck, if you have any better
ideas, you tell me now.

1883
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:01,760
We've only got three minutes
to eject this one.

1884
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:04,160
Beck!

1885
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:07,240
Come on, guys.
I can't hear you.

1886
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:11,440
Beck.

1887
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:54,720
Josh, come on.

1888
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:58,120
Are you okay?

1889
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:01,320
Are you okay?

1890
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:02,920
Will you take my gloves off?

1891
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,240
Oh, my God.

1892
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:07,520
Please.

1893
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:09,640
I had to build the blast.

1894
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:10,760
I'm sorry.

1895
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:12,320
Hold on, let me get...

1896
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:15,040
No. Stay here for one second.

1897
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:17,400
I was trying to call you.

1898
01:47:17,480 --> 01:47:19,840
I know the Coms were down.

1899
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:20,840
Right.

1900
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:22,360
I know what you did.

1901
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:24,680
We don't have enough energy...

1902
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:25,640
I know.

1903
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:27,000
...to get back.

1904
01:47:27,080 --> 01:47:28,440
You did good.

1905
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:32,400
I would've done the same thing.

1906
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:34,080
Where's Zimsky?

1907
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:38,040
Come here.

1908
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:40,520
You did good.

1909
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:43,720
You did good.

1910
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:59,400
One minute
to the first detonation.

1911
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:01,960
And 12 until the blast hits us.

1912
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:09,640
I was hoping we'd suffocate
to death first.

1913
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:44,760
Beck.

1914
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:47,240
Beck, Beck.

1915
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:48,440
What could you do

1916
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:50,960
if I got you enough power
to fire the impeller?

1917
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:53,120
Maybe not the laser
but the impeller.

1918
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:54,480
What? From where?

1919
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:56,360
The heat of the core.

1920
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:58,080
It's 9,000 degrees.

1921
01:48:58,120 --> 01:49:00,160
Unobtainium converts heat
to energy.

1922
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:03,360
So this whole damn ship is like
a big, old solar panel.

1923
01:49:03,400 --> 01:49:04,960
Come on, I need your help.

1924
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:13,640
Number two's going!

1925
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:15,920
Come on, come on.

1926
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:36,600
For here in the great infinite
unknowable...

1927
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:40,960
man can come to know the
most important thing of all:

1928
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:43,920
Himself.

1929
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,600
He can understand...

1930
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:49,760
What the fuck am I doing?

1931
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:27,560
We've got full rotation!

1932
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:28,640
It's turning!

1933
01:50:37,080 --> 01:50:39,360
All right!

1934
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:48,520
Come on, Beck, where is it?

1935
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:51,880
Come on.
Come on, hurry up.

1936
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:53,360
Is that the last one?

1937
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:55,560
Yeah.

1938
01:51:02,440 --> 01:51:05,440
Give it a couple seconds.

1939
01:51:13,640 --> 01:51:15,680
It worked!

1940
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:30,400
Get ready to pull a few G's.

1941
01:51:47,720 --> 01:51:49,120
420 knots.

1942
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:50,440
Now, this is more like it.

1943
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:51,240
440.

1944
01:51:58,640 --> 01:52:01,000
So, Rat, what's the center
of this quake?

1945
01:52:01,080 --> 01:52:02,080
It's everywhere!

1946
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:03,400
It's one giant shock wave!

1947
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:05,280
The planet's healing itself.

1948
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:08,760
At this speed,
we're going to be home

1949
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:11,040
in a third of the time.

1950
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:42,080
As long as we can surf

1951
01:52:42,160 --> 01:52:43,560
these magma flows,
we'll be okay.

1952
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:45,920
Let's just pray we don't run
into any dead ends,

1953
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:48,600
or we're going to miss
those lasers.

1954
01:52:51,240 --> 01:52:53,880
Okay, navigator, which way?

1955
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:55,360
We've got greater
fluid density on the left.

1956
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:57,040
Go with the flow.

1957
01:52:57,120 --> 01:52:58,320
Uh-huh.

1958
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:20,320
Bill, where are they headed?

1959
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:22,400
Looks like she found
a space between

1960
01:53:22,440 --> 01:53:24,480
some tectonic plates
somewhere near Hawaii.

1961
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:29,960
Josh...

1962
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:31,680
Yeah?

1963
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:32,520
They're closing in
on us too fast.

1964
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:34,160
I don't know if I can...

1965
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:35,360
Hey, you got it.

1966
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:55,280
Um... w-we lost them, Stick,
and I...

1967
01:54:15,240 --> 01:54:17,120
Where'd our power go?

1968
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:20,120
Well, we're powered by the heat.

1969
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:22,560
It's stone cold down here.

1970
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:26,720
Well...

1971
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:29,600
Look on the bright side.

1972
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:30,760
At least we're not

1973
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:32,000
going to boil to death.

1974
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:33,800
You always look
on the bright side?

1975
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:35,960
Always.

1976
01:54:37,320 --> 01:54:38,600
Okay, let's assess:

1977
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:44,000
We've got no communications,

1978
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:45,480
we're probably 800 feet down,

1979
01:54:45,520 --> 01:54:47,200
but we might as well
be 800 miles.

1980
01:54:47,240 --> 01:54:50,560
We're in an Unobtainium

1981
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:53,120
cigar tube with the sonar
signature of a rock.

1982
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:56,360
We've got just enough power
to make the ultrasonics burp,

1983
01:54:56,400 --> 01:54:57,640
but no one's listening

1984
01:54:57,720 --> 01:55:00,000
on those frequencies anyway,
and...

1985
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:01,960
nobody even knows we're alive.

1986
01:55:07,720 --> 01:55:09,920
Okay.

1987
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:12,040
Give me a minute on this one.

1988
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:28,840
This is hopeless.

1989
01:55:28,920 --> 01:55:31,400
Come on, General,
we've got to be getting close.

1990
01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:32,560
We can't...

1991
01:55:32,640 --> 01:55:34,560
Mr. Rat, even if
they were still alive,

1992
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:35,840
there's no way
they could contact us.

1993
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:37,520
Bridge.

1994
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:41,600
Skipper, Combat relays that our
sub has something on the sonar.

1995
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:43,240
Where do they think?

1996
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:45,640
Bill, put it up
on the hydrophone.

1997
01:55:48,680 --> 01:55:50,360
Whales, sir.

1998
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:52,040
They're a long way off
their usual path,

1999
01:55:52,120 --> 01:55:53,760
but that's not uncommon
since that, uh...

2000
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:55,000
what are they calling it?

2001
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:55,960
Orbital wobble?

2002
01:55:56,040 --> 01:55:57,600
Yeah, that's what they call it.

2003
01:55:57,680 --> 01:55:59,440
Well, thank you
very much, Captain,

2004
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:00,960
but I think we're done here.

2005
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:02,760
General.

2006
01:56:06,440 --> 01:56:08,120
J.O., this is the captain.

2007
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:10,360
Stand down from SAR Operations.

2008
01:56:40,680 --> 01:56:43,480
It's whales! It's whales!

2009
01:56:43,560 --> 01:56:45,600
Hey! General!

2010
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:47,320
Stick!

2011
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:48,480
It's whales!

2012
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:50,240
The ultrasonics!

2013
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:51,920
They're singing to them!

2014
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,800
You gotta find the whales!

2015
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:13,920
Alpha X Ray, this is
November Echo six one zero.

2016
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,080
I'm changing...

2017
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:17,480
Hold on, I'm seeing
those whales now.

2018
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:18,800
Whoa!

2019
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:20,320
Okay, ball's in the water.

2020
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:23,040
This is neat. Those whales
are circling something.

2021
01:57:23,080 --> 01:57:24,160
Hold on, hold on.

2022
01:57:24,240 --> 01:57:25,520
We have a strong echo here.

2023
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:26,480
Depth, 800 feet.

2024
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:28,120
There-there's something
down there.

2025
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:29,960
There's definitely
something down there.

2026
01:58:11,240 --> 01:58:13,720
I told you pulsing the
ultrasonics would work.

2027
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:16,920
Do you ever get tired
of being right?

2028
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:17,920
Yes.

2029
01:58:19,880 --> 01:58:22,040
So what's next for you?

2030
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:23,920
A shower.

2031
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:28,760
Then back to NASA, I guess.

2032
01:58:28,840 --> 01:58:29,920
You?

2033
01:58:29,960 --> 01:58:33,440
Deep-dish pepperoni pizza,
green peppers, onions,

2034
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:39,000
extra mushrooms... then a shower
and then back to the classroom.

2035
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:44,560
NASA could use
a few good men, you know.

2036
01:58:44,640 --> 01:58:45,840
Yeah.

2037
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:49,160
Unfortunately, so could my
freshmen geophysics students.

2038
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:53,520
You know what makes me
really, really angry?

2039
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:57,480
You know what makes me
really, really angry?

2040
01:58:57,560 --> 01:59:01,000
Bob, Serge, Braz, Zimsky...

2041
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:03,920
no one's going to ever know
what they did or why they died.

2042
01:59:06,520 --> 01:59:09,320
Unless...

2043
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:11,160
it all got out somehow.

2044
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:16,680
That's unthinkable.

2045
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:18,000
Yeah.

2046
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:54,160
Okay, here we go.

2047
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:04,360
Sweet.

2048
02:00:17,320 --> 02:00:20,520
It is now emerging that
the world owes its survival

2049
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:23,520
to the heroism of six
remarkable individuals...

2050
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:25,200
Shuttle Commander
Robert Iverson...

2051
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:26,520
This extraordinary craft...

2052
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:27,920
French Scientist, Dr. Serge...

2053
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,320
was captained by NASA astronaut
Dr. Bob Iverson.

2054
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:31,840
Edward Brazzleton
is a name so...

2055
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:34,080
Dr. Conrad Zimsky
will be best remembered...

2056
02:00:34,160 --> 02:00:35,200
On Capitol Hill today,

2057
02:00:35,240 --> 02:00:36,960
everyone's asking
the same question...

2058
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,160
What is Project Destiny?

2059
02:00:41,480 --> 02:00:43,680
Destiny, meet world.

2060
02:00:43,720 --> 02:00:46,600
World, meet Destiny.

2061
02:00:55,200 --> 02:01:03,440
Look at the red,
red changes in the sky

2062
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:11,200
Look at the separation
in the borderline

2063
02:01:11,240 --> 02:01:17,200
But don't look
at everything here inside

2064
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:19,560
Here inside

2065
02:01:19,640 --> 02:01:27,160
And be afraid,
afraid to speak your mind

2066
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:36,440
It took a moment
before I lost myself in here

2067
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:43,680
It took a moment and
I could not be found

2068
02:01:45,640 --> 02:01:50,080
Again and again
and again and again

2069
02:01:50,120 --> 02:01:53,920
I see your face in everything

2070
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:59,720
It took a moment the moment
it could not be found

2071
02:02:09,040 --> 02:02:17,000
What's with the fascination
with the echelon?

2072
02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:20,480
What's with
the constant questions

2073
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:25,480
That you have this time?

2074
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:31,040
What's with this
circumstantial consequence?

2075
02:02:31,120 --> 02:02:33,280
Consequence

2076
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:42,560
Find oversight before this
night will ever rise again

2077
02:02:42,640 --> 02:02:47,840
It's all you've got
inside your head

2078
02:02:47,880 --> 02:02:50,200
You better get up
and leave instead

2079
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:56,320
It took a moment before
I lost myself in here

2080
02:02:58,600 --> 02:03:03,680
It took a moment and
I could not be found

2081
02:03:05,800 --> 02:03:09,920
Again and again
and again and again

2082
02:03:09,960 --> 02:03:14,520
I see your face
in everything

2083
02:03:14,600 --> 02:03:19,000
It took a moment the moment
it could not be found

2084
02:03:19,080 --> 02:03:21,880
Found

2085
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:25,920
To find ourselves
lost here within

2086
02:03:25,960 --> 02:03:29,560
We need good reasons why

2087
02:03:29,640 --> 02:03:31,800
So we take this bridge

2088
02:03:31,880 --> 02:03:37,280
With the others that will thrive
in the great divide

2089
02:03:41,480 --> 02:03:51,240
Look at the red,
red changes in the sky.
